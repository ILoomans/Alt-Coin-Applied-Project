0,CryptoSlate,Investor: 4chan has become crypto’s “largest market driver” after Chainlink boom,Nick Chong,1595415600.0,"There are some that don’t think highly of 4chan — the anonymous messaging board. If you look at news regarding the site, some of it isn’t the most flattering. But over recent years, 4chan has gained influence in the Bitcoin and crypto industry, with its business and finance board (“biz”) acting as a conduit for that influence.One venture capitalist in the space went as far as to say that “4chan has become the largest market driver” in crypto. And as crazy as that may sound, CryptoSlate’s data suggests he’s kind of right.What’s behind the wheel of the crypto market? 4chan, apparentlyAccording to Andrew Kang, founder of Mechanism Capital and a prominent crypto analyst, said on Jul. 20 that the importance of 4chan to the industry cannot be understated.“One of the most interesting market dynamics at play right now is that 4chan has become the largest market driver. More powerful than even China or institutional crypto fund capital right now.”He used the example of Swipe (SXP) to convey this point.CryptoSlate data indicates that the altcoin, which is closely affiliated with Binance after a recent acquisition, is up 200 percent in the past week alone and close to 400 percent since its April lows.Chart of Swipe’s price action over the past month from Coin Market CapAccording to Kang, much of this recent price performance can be attributed to the crypto investors/traders on 4chan.The venture capitalist shared a screenshot of a thread on 4chan’s biz forum, which saw an anonymous user tell readers to “MAN UP” and buy Swipe due to “Binance cards, 20 million users, biggest and most liquid exchange covering everything, established partners, a chainlink node, 2,000+ app store reviews, and a market cap under $100 million.”CryptoSlate’s recent browsing of the page saw many other “anons” shilling the cryptocurrency incessantly.The Mechanism Capital investor added that 4chan’s biz has long had influence over this nascent market:“/biz/ was pretty influential as well and my primary source of deal flow in 2017, but then everyone there got broke as shit in 2018 buying shit like Raiblocks, Icon, Wabi, etc. at the top.”Really?What Kang is saying has credence.Some of the best-performing cryptocurrencies over the past few weeks and months are the following: Chainlink (LINK), Cardano (ADA), Ampleforth (AMPL), Aave’s LEND, Synthetix Network Token (SNX), Band Protocol (BAND), and THORChain (RUNE).The running theme between all of them, according to CryptoSlate’s viewing of the forum, is that all of them have an active following on 4chan.There is no project that makes this trend more apparent than Chainlink, which some analysts argue is purely a byproduct of anons from 4chan promoting the asset in every corner of the internet.Daryl Lau, a research analyst at crypto data site CoinGecko, has also noted that 4chan is responsible for sending an Ethereum-based altcoin 10,000 percent higher in two hours. Posted In: Chainlink, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
1,CryptoSlate,"Altcoins are going parabolic, but a VC says Bitcoin and DeFi will grow in “lock step”",Nick Chong,1595383200.0,"Unlike normal, the crypto spotlight has been focused on Ethereum’s budding decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem over the past few weeks, not on Bitcoin.This is for good reason: as CryptoSlate data indicates, countless Ethereum-based altcoins related to this cryptocurrency sector have surged as BTC has stagnated. In the past week alone, the DeFi sector has gained 13.87 percent. Those gains have been concentrated in a few crypto players such as Aave’s LEND, Ampleforth (AMPL), Synthetix Network Token (SNX), and THORChain (RUNE).With such strong growth over recent weeks, some have been asking if this is the end of Bitcoin’s dominance and the start of DeFi’s dominance. If you search up “Ethereum” or “DeFi” on Twitter, you see many of the blockchain’s proponents claiming that BTC is a “pet rock” while DeFi is the “real revolution.”According to a venture capitalist and strong DeFi proponent, it is not the end of Bitcoin’s dominance. In fact, he expects these two sectors to grow in “lock step.”DeFi and Bitcoin to grow in tandem? A VC thinks soImran Khan, an investor at the crypto-centric Volt Capital and a proponent of DeFi, says that he doesn’t expect DeFi to run away from Bitcoin in terms of growth.“Bitcoin and DeFi will grow in lock step, I foresee the macro changes push Bitcoin’s flywheel aggressively. While DeFi being a sub flywheel,” Khan commented, indicating that growth in BTC is effectively needed to drive users and capital to DeFi.He added that the two sectors of the cryptocurrency industry service two different “final bosses”: Bitcoin was built to usurp monetary sovereignty and DeFi was built to usurp traditional banking.As currency and finance are inherently related to each other, growth in one will drive the other. (There’s a reason why the U.S. has the most dominant currency and banking/finance sector.)Bitcoin and DeFi will grow in lock step, I foresee the macro changes push Bitcoin’s flywheel aggressively. While DeFi being a sub flywheel.Bitcoin’s final boss: Monetary sovereigntyDeFi’s final boss: Traditional banking https://t.co/7cmfZhT2xd— Imran Khan (@lmrankhan) July 19, 2020Khan’s comment was well received by some in the industry.But as one crypto trader commented, his comment doesn’t mean that the two will be locked at the hip on a short-term time frame:“Caveat is timeline as well, as @HumboldtCap pointed out, it will be imperative to catch the right trend and risk-on at the right moment.”Connecting the two ecosystemsFor Bitcoin to grow in tandem with DeFi and vice-versa, arguably moves will need to be made to connect the two ecosystems.As it stands, Bitcoin — and a majority of other top cryptocurrencies, for that matter — have effectively been cut out from the DeFi equation.By connecting the two ecosystems — by connecting the reserve currency of crypto to the Wall Street of crypto, in Khan’s terms — growth is accelerated. As Steven Becker, president of MakerDAO, explained to Bloomberg about projects to link Bitcoin and Ethereum DeFi:“tBTC is brilliant because ultimately it links two major concepts together. [Bitcoin and Ethereum working together] is how all these networks are going to come together to create the on-chain economy.”Posted In: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Altcoins, DeFi     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

3,CryptoSlate,The number of large transactions on Chainlink increased 15x in 2020,Priyeshu Garg,1595296800.0,"After the price of its native token LINK reached its all-time high last week, Chainlink has seen its on-chain metrics skyrocket. Data from crypto analytics company IntoTheBlock has shown that the number of large transactions on Chainlink has increased over 15 times in the past three months, matching the growth seen in the number of active addresses on the network.Chainlink has been on a roll in the past few months, seeing an unprecedented rise since it capitulated in mid-March during the market downturn. Aside from gaining an excess of 400 percent, its native cryptocurrency LINK has also seen a huge increase in use.Data from cryptocurrency analytics company IntoTheBlock has shown that Chainlink recorded the largest number of transactions greater than $100,000 since July 2019. On Jul. 13, the network recorded 300 large transactions—an increase of almost 1500 percent since the beginning of the year.Graph showing the number of large transactions on Chainlink from Jan. 1 to Jul. 20Given the fact that the large transaction volume on Chainlink has remained more or less the same even when its price reached its all-time high, the phenomenon could be explained by an influx of new users to the network.Graph showing the large transaction volume on Chainlink from Sep. 2017 to Jul. 2020.Increase in active addresses indicate a healthier networkChainlink’s latest price rally isn’t backed just by speculation—the network has seen its stable on-chain metrics gain a significant amount of strength in since March. This could mean that the 400 percent YTD increase won’t be followed by an equally steep consolidation and that LINK will spend most of the year above its current $8 level.Graph showing LINK’s price from Jul. 2019 to Jul. 2020 (Source: TradingView)This theory is backed by the fact that the number of new addresses and daily active addresses on the network has skyrocketed —data from IntoTheBlock has shown that there were over 9,500 active addresses on Chainlink on Jul. 16. On the same day, the network recorded an ATH of 4,590 new addresses.Graph showing the number of new addresses and daily active addresses on Chainlink from 2017 to 2020 (Source: IntoTheBlock)This indicates that the Chainlink network is growing at a healthy pace.

4,CryptoSlate,"Ethereum’s latest DeFi token just launched, and it’s 2,000% above its seed price",Nick Chong,1595242800.0,"While Bitcoin and Ethereum have continued to stagnate, it is clear that the decentralized finance (DeFi) finance craze is alive and well.In a single day, two tokens in this segment of the cryptocurrency market launched. One launched over one thousand percent higher than its seed round price, and another gained around 5,000 percent in a day.New Ethereum DeFi tokens rocket higherOn Jul. 18, after weeks of waiting, the new DeFi project mStable finally released its native token: Meta (MTA).In short, Meta is a governance token that will fully decentralize the Ethereum-based protocol, which is predicated on facilitating stablecoin swaps with low slippage and offering interest opportunities on stablecoins.According to Messari researcher Ryan Watkins, the public launch of the token, done through a new process called an “IDO,” was immensely profitable for some. An IDO is an initial decentralized exchange offering. Meta’s purportedly was a sight to be seen, with an Ethereum user attempting to manipulate the order book to change narratives.Trading at a price of $2.40 just minutes after it went live, MTA immediately netted early mStable investors over 1,000 percent returns if they sold.  And at the current price of $3.50, the Ethereum-based altcoin is over 2,200 percent higher than the price it was acquired during mStable’s seed round.MTA now trading at 16x its $0.15 seed price.The dynamics around the offering were much more fair, but still the fomo drove the price up far higher than any other IDO so far.I wonder if most people would’ve ended up paying less in the original offering at this point.— Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) July 18, 2020Three Arrows Capital, a prominent crypto-centric fund based in Singapore, is one of the investors known to have been part of that seed round.In a similar craze, yearn.finance, a multi-faceted DeFi protocol whose entire existence is rather mysterious, launched its native token YFI (YFI) on the same day. In a Medium post on the release, the team behind the Ethereum-based project wrote:“We have released YFI, a completely valueless 0 supply token. We re-iterate, it has 0 financial value. There is no pre-mine, there is no sale, no you cannot buy it, no it won’t be on Uniswap, no there won’t be an auction. We don’t have any of it.”This was seemingly a ruse.At the highs on Jul. 18, YFI traded at $2,250, more than 7,000 percent higher than the daily low price of $31 according to CoinGecko.Sentiment against DeFi growsThe increasingly high interest rates and returns of the DeFi space have made some question its fundamentals.Pseudonymous Bitcoin whale “Joe007,” who has verifiably made dozens of millions trading cryptocurrency on Bitfinex, said that he thinks DeFi is a “centralized Ponzi/HYIP scheme that uses random ‘crypto’ trappings to lure in dump money into the same old musical chairs game.”This was in reference to a comment from a DeFi-centric Twitter account that was asking about the next “hidden DeFi gem” in a way rather reminiscent of the 2017 and 2018 ICO boom and bust.Other largely Bitcoin-focused individuals have made similar comments, making comments like “DeFi is just Wall Street 2.0” and other things along those lines.Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, DeFi     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

5,CryptoSlate,"Should history rhyme, XRP may surge after XLM’s rally on Samsung partnership",Nick Chong,1595133180.0,"Despite strong rallies in countless altcoins, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency XRP has yet to share in the gains.According to CryptoSlate data, the digital asset is approximately flat on the year. This may not sound like a bad thing, but contrast this with Bitcoin’s 20 percent gain or Ethereum 80 percent gain and you can see why this is underwhelming. Worse yet, XRP is down by more than 90 percent from its all-time high price in excess of $3.But should a long-time correlation between the cryptocurrency and one of its close competitors, Stellar Lumens (XLM), hold, XRP could soon undergo a much-needed rally.XRP could finally rally because of XLM’s price actionAs reported by CryptoSlate previously, XLM has been one of the best performing cryptocurrencies over recent days.The asset gained 12 percent on Jul. 16, moving past crucial technical resistances as per analysis by Peter Brandt, a long-time commodities trader. XLM rallied on the back of news that major Korean technology company Samsung will be integrating the cryptocurrency into its Samsung Blockchain Keystore product.After a slight retracement as hype about the news died down, XLM has slid back under the $0.10 resistance but remains bullish as it holds key levels.Stellar Lumens (XLM) analysis by prominent commodities trader Peter BrandtThis is pertinent to XRP because the two assets have long been correlated with each other in terms of their price action.Analyst “Ceteris Paribus” shared this chart on Jul. 16 in the wake of XLM’s 12 percent surge. It shows that the two cryptocurrencies were basically tied at the hip from July of 2019 until April of this year. This can be corroborated by correlation data from Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics firm, which reports that the 180-day correlation of the two assets is over 0.80.Yet, as the chart also shows, they have recently deviated from each other. In the past year, XLM has gained nearly 30 percent while XRP has lost 34 percent over that same time period.XLM and XRP correlation chart from trader “Ceteris Paribus”Should the correlation recover, that means that XLM will need to crash or XRP will need to surge.Not everyone is convinced XRP will rallyEven with this strong correlation indicating that XRP may have some upside, not everyone is convinced that the asset will end up rallying.Brandt wrote earlier this year that since XRP broke a crucial resistance against Bitcoin, it could be primed to see a 90 percent correction to levels not seen since early 2017:“Looks like Ripple Labs has blown the wad allocated to support XRPBTC at .00002060 to .0002075 levels.

6,CryptoSlate,Key data takeaways from Chainlink’s rally to a new all-time high above $8,Nick Chong,1595052000.0,"Chainlink (LINK) has been on an absolute tear over the past few months. From its March capitulation lows, the asset has gained in excess of 400 percent as the cryptocurrency has gained popularity over strong partnerships and an extremely strong fan base.Behind this rally, though, is strong on-chain fundamental data that may lend to the sentiment that the altcoin has room to move even higher.A strong on-chain and data case for ChainlinkAlthough some metrics can be gamed, three top blockchain analytics firms Glassnode, Santiment, and IntoTheBlock suggest that the data case for Chainlink is stronger than ever.On the day LINK almost passed $9 for the first time ever, IntoTheBlock shared that three of the asset’s on-chain metrics were at all-time highs. These metrics were the number of active addresses, the number of addresses created, and the number of on-chain transactions.#Chainlink is on fire🔥, as the price is up 39% during the last 7-daysJuly 14 was a milestone day for the #LINK token because:– 14.26k addresses were active (highest # ever)↗️– 6.51k new addresses were created (highest # ever) ↗️– 22.8k on-chain transactions (highest # ever) pic.twitter.com/lMsJ7g0shc— intotheblock (@intotheblock) July 15, 2020IntoTheBlock’s chief scientist Jesus Rodriguez added in a separate report that the number of “large” Chainlink transactions (meaning in excess of $100,000 worth of value changing hands) has increased by 1,500 percent in three months.Santiment and Glassnode, too, have taken note of the surge in some of the cryptocurrency’s core metrics.Expect a pullback for LINKCrypto analyst Josh Olszewicz is warning of a bearish reversal in the price of LINK, despite the strong on-chain data.Sharing the chart below of the ratio between Chainlink and Bitcoin (LINK/BTC) on Jul. 16, he wrote: “I don’t want to be THAT GUY but LINK might be overbought here.” Backing this assertion, he pointed to four technical signs:The pair’s relative strength index (RSI) is at an all-time high, with the oscillator almost reaching 90. This is a textbook signal that the asset is alm0st extremely overbought.LINK is nearing the “R5 Yearly Pivot Resistance.” The asset previously found it difficult to break lower yearly pivots.LINK has reached the top of a pitchfork extension pattern. The last time the asset encountered this technical level, it briefly spiked before seeing a correction towards the bottom of the channel.A bearish divergence has formed between LINK’s price and the RSI on the 12-hour chart.LINK/BTC analysis by trader Josh OlszewiczThis has been echoed by another trader, who noted that LINK’s market volume and candlesticks read like a “blow-off-top” may be taking place.The true test of Chainlink’s rally, then, is likely to be how its on-chain fundamentals will perform when (or if) the correction comes.

7,CryptoSlate,"After Ethereum tokens surge, veteran trader Peter Brandt asks if Stellar Lumens (XLM) is next",Nick Chong,1594979700.0,"After trading somewhat in tandem with Bitcoin and Ethereum over recent weeks, which are flat on a macro scale, Stellar Lumens (XLM) saw a strong breakout on Jul. 16 that brought the asset up by over 10 percent, CryptoSlate data shows. As of this article’s writing, the cryptocurrency trades above $0.10.Even still, the asset is not yet in a decisive bull trend that altcoins like Chainlink and Cardano have found themselves in.According to Peter Brandt, a commodities trader with decades of experience, though, XLM’s outlook may soon change due to a positive technical setup.Stellar Lumens (XLM) is poised to rally higher, technicals and fundamentals showPrior to Jul. 16’s move that brought Stellar Lumens 10 percent higher, Peter Brandt shared the chart below. Attached to the chart, he asked: “Will $XLM Stellar Lumens be the next alt-coin to pump?This comment came shortly after he suggested the altcoins could undergo some bullish price action that allows them to gain against Bitcoin.Brandt’s chart shows that XLM broke out of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, often seen at the bottom of a bear trend to mark a reversal. The chart also indicates that the cryptocurrency broke above a descending channel that has confined its price action since 2018 and above a crucial horizontal at $0.089. The latter has held as resistance since the middle of 2019.Stellar Lumens (XLM) analysis by prominent commodities trader Peter BrandtAs we now know, just a day after he published this chart, Stellar Lumens underwent the 10% rally that allowed it to retake $0.10.While technicals may have played a part, this bullish price action can be attributed to news that Samsung’s crypto-enabled devices will now have Stellar Lumens integrated. The technology this will be enabled through is the Samsung Blockchain Keystore, a digital asset wallet for some of the firm’s devices in certain jurisdictions that allows for the secure holding of cryptocurrency.Although this may not be Samsung the corporation using Stellar technology, this announcement has sparked “encore spikes” in social volume, data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment has recently shown.Time for Bitcoin to shineAlthough XLM may be primed to rally even higher, some analysts think it is time for Bitcoin to shine after the short-term “altcoin season” that the market has experienced in recent weeks.One prominent crypto trader shared this chart below of Bitcoin’s dominance metric, the percentage of the cryptocurrency market made up of BTC.He believes that the metric is currently in a corrective downtrend that will eventually revert to the upside, crushing altcoins as 2020 comes to a close. The trader believes that this will be triggered by a sell-off in the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin will outperform altcoins due to its relative stability, liquidity, and narratives.Bitcoin dominance analysis by trader Dave the WaveThe trader who shared the chart below is the same one who predicted that Bitcoin would bottom 2019’s bear trend at $6,400 months before it bounced at that exact level.

8,CryptoSlate,Bitcoin’s trading volume is shifting towards altcoins as BTC flatlines,Cole Petersen,1594969200.0,"Bitcoin’s trading volume has been sliding slower throughout the past several months as it continues trading within an incredibly tight trading range.This range has been compressing throughout the past few weeks, with BTC now respecting $9,000 and $9,300 as two short-term range boundaries.New data suggests that this lackluster price action seen by the benchmark cryptocurrency may be coming about as a result of the trading volume being directed away from BTC and into altcoins.If this is the case, then Bitcoin may not be able to break its tight trading range until capital begins cycling away from altcoins and back into the benchmark digital asset.Bitcoin’s trading volume dives as volatility reaches historic lowsBitcoin’s volatility has seen an unprecedented decline throughout the past several weeks.The crypto’s consolidation trend first began in early-May, with BTC rapidly developing a tight trading range between $9,000 and $10,000. Each break above or below this range has been fleeting in the time since.This volatility has sidelined many active market participants, causing trading volume to fall into an intense downtrend.Arcane Research provided data relating to Bitcoin’s trading volume in a recent research report, offering a chart showing this decline while adding that the trend is “concerning.”“The 7-day average real trading volume continues to trend downwards this week… While the overall trading volume in the crypto market is looking more stable than the bitcoin volume, it is certainly concerning to see this steady downwards trend…” they noted.Data Source: Arcane ResearchAccording to data from analytics platform Skew, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume on Coinbase has been incredibly low over the past month, averaging at $74 million.Bouts of low volume and volatility are typically short-lived, but this current trend isn’t showing any signs of shifting anytime soon.Altcoin’s gain a growing share of the crypto market’s trading volumeThe source of the exodus of trading volume that Bitcoin has been seeing could be altcoins, which have been gaining heightened control over the market’s volume dominance.One popular pseudonymous trader who trades under the name “Hsaka” offered a chart showing the rise in volume dominance that altcoins have been seeing as of late.“Volume Dominance of BTC, ETH, USDT and the top 50 alts for the past 4 months. While total volume has been bleeding out, alts have started to grab a larger share for themselves.”Image Courtesy of Hsaka.Until the cycle of investors moving their capital towards altcoins begins to revert into Bitcoin’s favor, its sideways trading will likely be heightened by declining trading volume.

10,CryptoSlate,Hoskinson discusses building Cardano’s (ADA) governance era Voltaire on the ITN,Priyeshu Garg,1594807200.0,"Despite full decentralization with Shelley still being days away, there’s a lot of talk in the Cardano (ADA) community about Voltaire, the blockchain’s governance era. Built on the remnants of the Shelley Incentivized Testnet (ITN), Voltaire will exist first as a separate chain and then as an indivisible part of Cardano, enabling its users to submit and vote for everything from deep changes to Cardano’s monetary policy to funding developers working on quantum-resistant algorithms.Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, took a deep dive into the process of creating Voltaire on the ITN in his latest whiteboard video, explaining the road it will take before it gets completely merged with Cardano.Tackling governance begins with defining governanceWhile most of the crypto industry is currently knee-deep in tackling staking and various other problems with proof-of-stake protocols, the brains behind Cardano have been hard at work developing the foundations of governance.Despite hard work currently being done on creating a protocol that would allow the community to essentially run Cardano, governance is actually the final phase of the blockchain’s development. The reason why IOHK has been heavily involved in governance in the past few months is that Voltaire, the governance phase, is actually being built on top of the existing Shelley Incentivized Testnet.Once Shelley was deployed to the Cardano mainnet, the question of what to do with the Incentivized Network was left to the Cardano community. After it was decided that it would be used as a decentralized sandbox environment for building and testing Voltaire.In his latest YouTube video, Charles Hoskinson dove deep into how IOHK is tackling Voltaire. Hoskinson explained that creating a successful governance system required answering two main questions—who pays and who decides in a decentralized network. While they might sound simple, the answers to these two questions will form the very foundation upon which a decentralized governance system will grow and evolve.“Protocols live within a broad environment,” Hoskinson said. There’s no such thing as a single “Cardano” protocol—the Cardano ecosystem consists of a network protocol, ledger rules, and consensus rules, all of which represent IOHK’s best estimate as to how a crypto project should look like. All of those things, however, change over time, which means that everything else has to evolve alongside them as well.“When we talk about protocols that live in the provenance of a decentralized system, suddenly you have this big question mark that exists—’who decides?’”As Cardano was built on the notion that it represents you, the end-user, it seems fitting that it would be the users who decide on the fate of the blockchain.That’s where Voltaire steps in.Hoskinson explained that Voltaire isn’t a separate governance protocol—it’s a catch-all term for a collection of utilities, concepts, and experiments that allow Cardano users to collectively make decisions about things such as changes to the blockchain and fund spending.The first idea of hosting Voltaire on the ITN popped up back in February, where IOHK decided that it should be used as a codebase that can grow and evolve. With an abundance of scientific papers about voting and other governance-related concepts, IOHK decided to put them all into the ITN and keep evolving them until a type of beta protocol was developed that could, in theory, run parallel to Cardano.Depending on how the testing goes, it would evolve into either a permissioned or a permissionless side-chain watches the Cardano mainnet and gives a subset of ADA holders the ability to vote on changes. The “experimental sandbox,” as Hoskinson called it, would see new capabilities and concepts added every six to eight weeks.Building Voltaire from the ballot upThe foundational work on Voltaire was finished just in time for the Cardano Virtual Summit, where the governance side-chain was first turned on. The best way to start with such a complex concept, Hoskinson said, was to start simple. That’s why the main focus of the Voltaire premiere was the basic spending unit of any governance protocol—the ballot.A ballot is nothing more than a funding proposal, which anyone can submit to the network for approval. In order to avoid creating a whole new system for submitting proposals from the ground up, IOHK partnered with Submittable. The company, as its name suggests, specializes in creating systems that allow people to submit proposals and ballots. As of now, the company has provided Cardano users with a template they could use for creating and submitting proposals. More information about the partnership between the two companies and its impact on Voltaire will be discussed in depth during the product update at the end of July.To create a productive and efficient system, IOHK needed to put in place a sorting mechanism that would clear out spam and potential attacks. Hoskinson said that this issue was resolved in two ways—with a pre-filter and a concept he called “innovation management.”A pre-filter would be a simple sorting mechanism deployed at the level of Submittable, where inaccurately filed proposals would be dismissed. The concept of innovation management would then be used to give credibility to the proposals that passed through the pre-filter. This will be done through a third-party application, which Hoskinson said is still being finalized.Nonetheless, the basic idea behind this is that the ballots should be scrutinized by a community of experts. However, these experts won’t be able to reject ballots—they would instead attach metadata to the proposals, stating their thoughts and opinions. The third-party vendor would be responsible for providing them with the right incentives to take their responsibility seriously.After this “soft filter” comes a two-stage voting round where the fate of the proposals would be decided by the community. The system will consist of a preference vote and then a threshold vote.Voting through lockingWhile all of Cardano’s users can participate in the governance process, they will need to register for their votes to become eligible. Voter registration will enable both the users and IOHK to get a better understanding of what the decision threshold will be and how to exclude certain actors from the voting process.These “actors,” however, aren’t undesirable people—as a fully decentralized system, Cardano cannot censor or discriminate against any one person in particular—but cryptocurrency exchanges. To prevent exchanges from using the ADA they hold on behalf of their users from essentially running the Cardano network.According to Hoskinson, the way IOHK managed to solve this problem was rather simple—by introducing a token locking mechanism. A vote on the governance of Cardano is initiated by a transaction that locks users’ ADA for a certain period of time. This transaction generates a new address and new metadata. While it’s yet to be decided on how long this will be, Hoskinson said that it could be for a few epochs—no longer than a few days.This kills two birds with one stone. Firstly, it keeps user funds secure as even if these addresses get compromised, the worst thing that could happen is that someone could vote instead of users. No funds can be stolen from these addresses.Secondly, if the only way for users to vote with their coins is to lock them, then exchanges would automatically be excluded from the voting process. Regulated exchanges have on-demand accounts, which means they have to have their users’ funds available at all times. Locking them, even if it’s in a voting mechanism, would be a major regulatory breach no exchange would bother risking.What makes this governance process important, aside from the fact that it will grow and develop alongside Cardano, is the fact that it can be used by any token that gets issued on the Cardano network. Stablecoins and other types of digital assets won’t have to come up with their own governance processes and then waste both time and resources by deploying them on Cardano—they can utilize Voltaire and set their own voting thresholds and other governance parameters.However, there’s still no clear schedule for when Voltaire will become an essential part of Cardano. Hoskinson noted that IOHK is still in the process of deciding whether Voltaire will be completely merged with Cardano through a hard fork or stay a separate chain connected to Cardano with an interoperability bridge.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Analysis, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

11,CryptoSlate,Wall Street veteran outlines why Ethereum is up 85% in 2020 and has long-term value,Nick Chong,1594796400.0,"In some Bitcoin-centric circles, there’s been a sentiment recently proposed that Ethereum and its current use cases have no value.To certain commentators, decentralized finance — better known as DeFi — only perpetuates what some see as shortcomings of traditional financial firms and products.  Also, some say that Ethereum’s primary use case as a platform for smart contract development and deployment can be replaced by Bitcoin projects such as Rootstock and Liquid.Yet according to a Wall Street research veteran, there are good reasons to think Ethereum has long-term value.A top crypto researcher explains why Ethereum has valueMatt Hougan, the head of research at Bitwise and the former CEOs of Inside ETFs and ETF.com, recently published an extensive post to Forbes outlining “why Ethereum has value.”Core to his sentiment is that Ethereum provides developers and innovators the opportunity to address the following question: “What if we could apply the ‘programmable transactions’ capability to rethink virtually every type of service offered by the financial industry?”What Hougan is referring to, of course, is decentralized finance. To the crypto analyst, DeFi is,“[A way to replace] huge chunks of the rent-seeking, history-of-bad-behavior, and solvency-risk financial system with something software-based, easy to audit, nonreliant on human judgment, and vastly more efficient?”The improvements Ethereum has made to financial applications through stablecoins and lending and borrowing applications show that Ethereum has room to grow into and with  DeFi.Hougan best summed up Ethereum’s growth potential in DeFi by noting that the market capitalization of ETH is “around 10% of just the fines that U.S. banks paid since the 2008 Great Recession.” The insinuation he was making is that DeFi may have the potential to usurp many of the old guard’s traditional products.Watch out for competitorsWhile Ethereum may have value as a platform for stablecoins, DeFi, and other purposes, there are potential “killer” competitors on the horizon.The blockchain’s strong uptick in adoption over recent weeks has been marked by a strong increase in transaction fees. Just take a look at Crypto Twitter, where there are multiple instances of individuals paying in excess of $10 for interactions with smart contracts in the DeFi space.Qiao Wang, a prominent crypto trader, noted that after an expensive interaction with an Ethereum application, he’s fearful the platform can be “dethroned”:“I’ve changed my mind after using a dozen of Defi platforms. So long as ETH 2.0 is not fully rolled out, there’s an obvious opportunity for a highly scalable blockchain to dethrone Ethereum. Paying $10 transaction fee and waiting 15 seconds for settlement is just bad UX.”Even one of the blockchain’s proponents and entrepreneurs said that it’s good to remember that Ethereum “hasn’t won yet.”Not only that, but some say the blockchain is lacking in terms of transaction speed and bandwidth, offering a 13~14-second transaction time and a theoretical maximum of under 50 transactions per second.Enter Ethereum competitors such as Cardano, which promise to encroach on the incumbent leader’s market share by offering a faster and more streamlined user and developer experience.The thing is, thus far, no blockchains have delivered on becoming “Ethereum killers.”Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

12,CryptoSlate,Analyst: XRP’s inability to rally as many altcoins go parabolic is a “remarkable” feat,Nick Chong,1594774800.0,"Countless crypto assets have been on a tear over the past few weeks. Assets such as Band Protocol (BAND), Synthetix Network Token (SNX), Cosmos (ATOM), and even large-cap altcoins such as Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK) are up dozens of percent in the past week alone.Yet XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and a fan-favorite digital asset, has not benefited from the recent price action.According to CryptoSlate data, XRP was trading four percent higher on the first day of June than it is as of this article’s writing, on Jul. 14.An analyst has branded this price action “remarkable.”XRP’s inability to rally is strikingAccording to Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and the co-founder of crypto analytics firm Coin Metrics, “The fact that XRP hasn’t participated in this rally at all is remarkable.” He added that from a macro perspective, the crypto asset has actually been in a downtrend in both Bitcoin and U.S. dollar terms for over two and a half years. This is in reference to the fact that since the 2018 blow-off top above $3.00, the asset has established a series of lower lows and lower highs. As reported by CryptoSlate previously, research firm Weiss Crypto Ratings said on XRP’s macro downtrend:“It keeps making lower highs and lower lows, with the most recent low being as early as May of this year.”Carter partially attributed XRP’s inability to rally amid these market conditions to the purportedly high inflation rate of the asset’s circulating supply.He shared the chart below from his company’s data, which suggests that XRP’s circulating supply is around 16 percent — 780 percent higher than that of Bitcoin and around triple that of Ethereum. Carter explained:“Keep in mind that due to vesting and founder sales XRP’s annualized issuance rate as of today based on 2020 pacing is 16%. Just a ton of supply the market has to absorb.”Chart of XRP’s circulating supply from CoinMetrics. Current as of Jul. 14Room to fall, analysts sayThe cryptocurrency has room to say, some commentators have said.One pseudonymous trader, known for making accurate calls in the Bitcoin market, recently said that XRP could drop to 1,500 satoshis. This would mark a more than 25 percent drop in the altcoin’s current price against the market leader.This bearish expectation can be corroborated by data.XRP’s on-chain transaction volume has recently been waning, reaching lows after a spike a few months back.Adding to the downside risk, it was recently reported by on-chain analysts that XRP owned by the PlusToken Ponzi scheme may be moving to exchanges, suggesting these coins will soon be sold.Posted In: XRP, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
13,CryptoSlate,"Chainlink’s competitor, BAND Protocol, is up 100% in the past week",Nick Chong,1594714920.0,"Chainlink (LINK) has been on an absolute tear over the past few weeks and months.As CryptoSlate has covered extensively, the popular cryptocurrency set a new all-time high just this past weekend, passing $8 for the first time ever as CryptoSlate data shows. This is a price that is over 500 percent higher than the March capitulation lows.Unbeknownst to many, one of Chainlink’s main competitors in the oracle space, Band Protocol (BAND), has also been rallying.Chainlink’s competitor in the oracle space, Band, is up 100% as LINK has surgedChainlink and Band offer what are known as “oracles” to the crypto and blockchain space.Oracles are technologies that connect real-world data, such as a Bloomberg price feed for a company’s stock, to blockchains and their respective smart contracts.As smart contracts increasingly become financialized (eg. Synthetix) and tied to real-world events (eg. Augur), these oracles are essential in providing actionable data for users and developers.Chainlink is by far the leader in the space. It is being integrated into a state-sponsored blockchain network in China called the Blockchain Service Network and it the project has secured partnerships with countless crypto giants. Heck, even an ex-NBA player, who is also a former husband of Kim Kardashian, mentioned the asset.But the project’s lead has not been unmatched.In the past week, the price of Band Protocol’s BAND token is up by approximately 100 percent.Like LINK, it is seemingly benefiting from the crypto industry’s realization that for smart contracts to go mainstream, data from the Internet needs to be reliably integrated into blockchains.Chart of Band’s (BAND) price action over the past two weeks from TradingViewBAND, which is backed by Silicon Valley giant Sequoia, may also be benefiting from its offering of staking. Users that stake the cryptocurrency can earn 17 percent per year on their holdings.As reported by CryptoSlate, previous instances of cryptocurrency projects implementing staking have seemingly corresponded with bullish price action.This is because staking incentives investors to purchase the cryptocurrency, then lock it up to earn rewards, decreasing potential sell pressure.Room to rally?Kelvin Koh, a partner at the Spartan Group and a former Goldman Sachs partner, said that the asset may have room to rally.0/ The first phase of $BAND’s re-rating culminated in its mainnet launch lifting its circ. market cap to $40M (FD $200M).The next phase of $BAND’s re-rating has started and will focus primarily on partnership announcements in the coming 6-12 months. https://t.co/7h2TeZIppL— SpartanBlack (@SpartanBlack_1) July 13, 2020He explained that since launching its own mainnet, the Band Protocol has announced two key partnerships.The partnerships are with Math Wallet, a crypto wallet with a “large userbase in China” and with Waves Protocol. The latter partnership will see the duo focus on decentralized finance, gaming, and DAOs.BAND’s new collaborators, along with others likely soon to come, will potentially boost the crypto asset, Koh speculated:“This will drive the next phase of re-rating. Even assuming its market cap doubles from here to $100M (FD mkt cap ~$0.5B), its valuation will only be at 4-6% of Chainlink’s current valuation, implying room for significant upside.”The investor concluded that with DeFi going mainstream, oracle services, whether they’re offered through Chainlink, Band, or another platform, have an opportunity set that “couldn’t be more promising.”Posted In: Chainlink, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

14,CryptoSlate,Strong fundamentals mean Cardano (ADA) could keep up with its July rally,Priyeshu Garg,1594704600.0,"Cardano, now the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, could see its current upward momentum last for quite a while without seeing any major consolidation. The latest data from analytics company IntoTheBlock showed that there is very little resistance between ADA’s current price of $0.13 and $0.14, while the previous major level of $0.12 could hold strong and prevent the coin from retracting.July has so far been a great month for CardanoAfter taking a major blow in mid-March alongside the rest of the Market, Cardano has been on what can only be described as an unstoppable rally. Fueled by the slew of major developments coming from IOHK, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency ADA has been on a roll this month.Graph showing Cardano’s priceData from Cryptoslate shows that ADA is up 62.5 percent this month.And while ADA is still far away from the ATH of $1.16 it saw in January 2018, Cardano’s on-chain metrics show that this rally could very well continue throughout the summer.According to data from cryptocurrency analytics company IntoTheBlock, almost 77 percent of all addresses holding ADA are in profit, having bought the coin at a lower price than its current value.Chart showing the percentage of Cardano addresses in profit. (Source: IntoTheBlock) Data suggests Cardano won’t be consolidating any time soonWhile the launch of Shelley and the upcoming releases regarding Goguen both point to a bright future for Cardano, they aren’t reliable factors when predicting ADA’s short-term price movements. What could be viewed as a better indicator of minor price movements are the addresses holding ADA, as they form the tough resistances that could halt the current upward trend and lead to consolidation.However, according to IntoTheBlock, there’s very little chance that ADA won’t be able to break through to the critical level of $0.14.Namely, when analyzing information for addresses that bought ADA between $0.11 and $0.15, we can see that almost 16,000 addresses bought ADA for $0.12. The 1.39 billion ADA purchased by these addresses has formed a very strong resistance that allowed Cardano to jump over 62 percent this month.Chart showing the percentage of Cardano addresses in profit around ADA’s current priceWith only 5,200 addresses currently out of the money, meaning they bought ADA above its current level of $0.13, there would be very little resistance if its current rally was to continue.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Price Watch     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

The 7-day pump pushed the coin all the way up to its all-time high of $8.23 earlier today.Graph showing LINK’s price from Jul. 6 to Jul. 13.While there’s a myriad of different factors that could have caused LINK’s incredible rally, one seems to stand out—retail investors.Data from cryptocurrency analytics company IntoTheBlock showed that 16 percent of addresses are holding LINK since last month.

17,CryptoSlate,Cardano (ADA) is closing in on Bitcoin SV’s status as the sixth-largest crypto,Nick Chong,1594602000.0,"At the peak of the crypto bubble, Cardano (ADA) was the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, believe it or not. Near its peak, the cryptocurrency had a market capitalization in excess of $20 billion, only trading behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Bitcoin Cash.But over the course of the bear market in 2018 and 2019, ADA slumped. The asset underperformed many of its altcoin peers as the speculative highs of the last crypto bubble become gruesome lows.Cardano’s surge over recent months, however, is quickly returning the asset to its former glory.Cardano is about to surmount Bitcoin SV (BSV) as the sixth-largest cryptoCardano has been a tear over recent months.As reported by CryptoSlate previously, data shows that the leading cryptocurrency is up more than 200 percent since the start of 2020. This makes it the best-performing smart contract coin of the year.The asset’s performance is even more striking when you take the return from the March lows. From the capitulation lows, the asset has gained over 500 percent.  For some context, Bitcoin is “only” up 150 percent since those same lows.Cardano’s relative outperformance has allowed it to climb up the crypto rankings.In fact, CryptoSlate data shows that the asset is a few million dollars away from passing the market capitalization of Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV). This means that if ADA moves slightly higher while BSV stagnates, Cardano will become the sixth-largest cryptocurrency for the first time since the 2018 highs.CryptoSlate cryptocurrency leaderboard. Current as of Jul. 12Will ADA move even higher?Cardano may soon be the sixth-largest digital asset, but some expect it to move even higher, both in terms of the crypto leaderboard and its actual value.Ryan Selkis, the chief executive of Messari, commented earlier this year that he thinks ADA will become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in 2021. He made this comment when the asset was approximately 30 percent below where it is today.Selkis did not expand on why he thinks Cardano will rise so far and so far, but there are others that have weighed in.The founder of the cryptocurrency Charles Hoskinson said that with the introduction of Cardano’s “Shelley” upgrade, it will begin to combat some of Ethereum’s market share as a smart contract platform. This is in reference to how thus far, Ethereum has been the leader in the smart contract space, offering the most diverse use cases and the highest number of active users.Hoskinson more recently said that he thinks the code of the Shelley upgrade is the “highest quality” in the crypto space, referencing the blockchain’s arduous and extensive development process:“We’re speeding up and accelerating and we’re doing so with some of the highest quality code that’s ever been written in the history of our space because we’re using a really scientific language Haskell and we’re using formal methods… that which is the same engineering standards that NASA uses and SpaceX uses for their rockets.”Cardano also stands to rally because Shelley activates staking, which is the process of locking up one’s cryptocurrency, thus participating in a blockchain’s governance, which provides a yield to participants.Messari found that staking has been one of the primary catalysts in the altcoin market over recent months, pushing cryptocurrencies higher before and after their respective launches of staking technology.Posted In: Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

22,CryptoSlate,TikTok hype triggers 100% Dogecoin rally—and Tron’s Justin Sun wants in,Nick Chong,1594283400.0,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a hell of a rally over the past few days.CryptoSlate data shows that from its price on Sunday of $0.0024 on Sunday, the meme cryptocurrency has rallied over 100 percent. The altcoin trades at $0.0048 as of this article’s writing, but reached as high as $0.0056 on Jul. 7.What’s fascinating about this isn’t Dogecoin’s price performance, it’s what triggered the brunt of the rally: TikTok. Users of the social media application, which has grown to be one of the most famous in the world, have created the so-called “Dogecoin TikTok Challenge.”The premise of the challenge is to get everyone on TikTok to buy DOGE, thus increasing the price of the cryptocurrency by hundreds, maybe thousands of percent.Screenshot of the description of a Dogecoin TikTok from “Jamezg97”The hashtag for this challenge has hundreds of thousands of views. The TikTok challenge has spurred Youtuber Jake Paul, Bloomberg, Barstool Sport’s Dave Portnoy, Keemstar, Gizmodo, and many other entities with large audiences to talk about Dogecoin as well.Its a level of mainstream popularity that crypto really hasn’t seen since 2017 or 2018.It’s no surprise, then, that other crypto projects are attempting to capitalize on this hype. The latest entrant: Tron (TRX).Tron and Justin Sun want in on the TikTok crypto crazeThere’s no doubt that Tron and its founder, Chinese entrepreneur Justin Sun, are big on social media. Sun’s personal social media pages and the company accounts — yes, there are many — are rife with content.They’ve stuck with traditional venues thus far: Twitter, Instagram, Weibo (for Sun’s Chinese audience), Youtube, and the like.But according to Sun, as of Jul. 7, the project is now focusing on “more TIK TOK content,” adding that he thinks TRON videos will “go viral.”Starting today, we'll focus on more TIK TOK content…stay tuned for #TRON videos going viral! #TRX @tiktok_us— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) July 8, 2020Can Dogecoin’s strength be repeated? Although TRX could see an influx of mainstream popularity with the right TikTok trends and campaigns, the effect the social media platform had on Dogecoin’s price action may be a one-time thing.A cryptocurrency trader wrote on Jul. 6 on why Dogecoin’s price action can move so high, so fast:“Seeing a lot of people point out that DOGE has a large circulating supply, and assume it is hard to pump. That is untrue, not only a good chunk of amount of DOGE supply is dormant+lost, and on exchange ask orders are very thin, the actual liquid market cap is significantly lower.”There’s also the fact that Dogecoin is one of the only 18 cryptocurrencies on Robinhood, which is the only crypto platform that many TikTok users have easy access to.Plus, DOGE has a culture around it that invites these weird challenges and social media mentions. Other crypto projects, on the other hand, may struggle in this arena because they’re often seen as too serious or too corporate.Posted In: Tron, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

23,CryptoSlate,On-chain analyst explains why Chainlink (LINK) is in a “parabolic advance”,Nick Chong,1594278000.0,"The crypto market has seen a flurry of activity over the past week. Altcoins from Cardano (ADA) and Compound (COMP) to VeChain (VET) and Chainlink (LINK) are all strongly outperforming Bitcoin. They’re outperforming the market leader by literally dozens of percent.Some hot crypto assets have found a top: COMP has dropped 50 percent from its all-time high and ADA’s rally stopped abruptly at $0.14.Yet there is an analyst that says Chainlink will buck the trend, citing technical and on-chain evidence indicating LINK is in a “parabolic advance.”The evidence suggesting Chainlink is in a “parabolic advance”According to Cole Garner, an on-chain analyst and forex trader, Chainlink is likely in the midst of a “full-blown parabolic advance” after setting new high after new high over recent days.Extrapolating the price action from LINK’s last major bull run in 2019, he suggested that the crypto still has room to rally by at least 50 percent against Bitcoin.Chainlink/Bitcoin chart by Cole Garner, from TradingViewThis positive sentiment is corroborated by a swath of on-chain, exchange, and sentiment signals, including:LINK’s Mean Dollar Invested Age is curling down. Every time this metric has curled down in the past year, the cryptocurrency proceeded to rally even further, going parabolic.The amount of the altcoin on exchanges has trended lower and lower over the past two years, indicating a decrease in potential selling pressure.Chainlink’s order book on Binance is showing that investors are still “skewed long.”LINK’s on-chain volume is still not yet at bubble levels.Chainlink is the leading “emerging trend” in crypto social media circles.Don’t count out a LINK sell-offDespite these signs, not everyone is convinced Chainlink’s rally is sustainable.As reported by CryptoSlate previously, blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported on Jul. 5 that LINK’s market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio is at an all-time high value. This has only been exacerbated since then as the altcoin has continued its ascentThis indicator at such a high value indicates that “almost everyone holding LINK is in profit,” which Santiment asserts is a “dangerous” trend.Shortly after Santiment released this data, one of the company’s contemporaries, Glassnode, found that $15 million worth of LINK was sent to Binance in 5,000 different transactions. Some thought this was going to be a catalyst for a dump, but a retracement never really took place.The issue with the MVRV indicator is that it assumes a large portion of investors eventually take profit on their trades. As is the case with Synthetix, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, there are often investors that are willing to hold their assets at all costs, rendering the MVRV indicator somewhat moot.

24,CryptoSlate,Smarter contracts: Unraveling the upcoming Goguen era of Cardano (ADA),Priyeshu Garg,1594267200.0,"During Cardano’s (ADA) 2020 summit, more details about Goguen, the blockchain’s smart contract era, were revealed. Cardano product manager Nebojsa Vojinovic laid out the functionalities that Goguen will bring and the timeline in which it will roll out, saying that Goguen was a key building block in creating a global social and financial system on Cardano.Cardano’s third era will make Cardano a true service platformCardano is currently still turning into a completely decentralized system, but IOHK has been working hard on the blockchain’s next era—the one that will bring about smart contracts. During last week’s Cardano Virtual Summit, more details were laid out about Goguen and the functionality it will bring to the growing ecosystem.After Shelley launch this month, all focus will shift to GoguenGoguen rollout is expected to start by year-end. It focusses on smart-contracts and puts Cardano in a position to directly compete with the likes of Ethereum.Multi-Asset LedgerNebojsa Vojinovic, the product manager at Cardano, dove deep into Goguen in a session during the summit, explaining the basics of the blockchain’s upcoming era. Namely, Goguen is the third “development theme” in Cardano, and is set to be followed by Basho, which will bring about scaling and interoperability, and Voltaire, the era of governance.Goguen is the key building block in creating a global social and financial system on Cardano, as it will allow both IOHK and others to build solutions around application domains as supply chains, property management, and traditional finance.As Goguen is primarily a service platform, heavy emphasis was put on user experience and utility. Building a user-friendly application doesn’t seem like too much work until you realize that Goguen isn’t a closed-off ecosystem. Vojinovic said it was a challenge to create a system that can be seamlessly integrated into existing applications, mostly off-chain.Goguen is targeting both businesses and developersAn interoperable platform that doesn’t lock people into the Cardano ecosystem will undoubtedly appeal to businesses and governments, which Vojinovic said were what IOHK had in mind when developing Goguen.However, Goguen is primarily aimed at developers. It provides them with the foundation and the tools they need to build applications on Cardano. Mobile, web, and desktop application developers, blockchain protocol developers, embedded developers, fintech developers, and smart contract developers will all be able to utilize Goguen, Vojinovic said.All of them will be able to explore building alternative environments on Cardano and grow the developer community.But they don’t need to wait for Goguen to launch to utilize some of the features it will bring. Developers can participate by submitting transactions to Cardano, querying the states of wallets and the ledger, monitoring network health, and attaching metadata to transactions.With those functionalities, developers can build web and mobile frontends, integrate Cardano as a payment backend, and build applications that transact with the Cardano blockchain.When Goguen does launch, it will make Cardano a multi-asset ledger and bring about Plutus applications and Marlowe contracts. Multi-asset ledger capability allows users to define, forge, and transfer their won custom tokens on Cardano.However, unlike Ethereum, whose blockchain prioritizes transactions and contracts in ETH over other ERC-20 tokens, Goguen won’t differentiate between ADA and other tokens issued on Cardano.Tokens issued on Cardano will inherit all security and smart contract behavior of ADA, making operations easier for developers.

After all; YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Google are notorious for banning cryptocurrency content—with some opacity around their reasons for doing so.It’s for good reason. Free-for-all media brought with them scams, hype, and presence-based crypto valuations in 2017-18. Prices were not based on technology, but on which project was a better marketer.However, this didn’t bear well, as most in the crypto-space know. An estimated 99 percent of all ICOs fell to pre-listing prices, with only a few survivors actually launching any product or fulfilling their roadmap.Where top crypto investors spend most of their time.2010-2013: Bitcointalk2014-2015: Reddit2016-2020: Twitter2021-2030: TikTok https://t.co/EfYwF4Q5FU— Qiao Wang (@QWQiao) July 7, 2020Meanwhile, the user behind the recent DOGE pump seemed to call it a joke: This tiktok I made the other day as a joke about Dogecoin went mega viral and now the crypto’s value is up 16% in the last 24hrs lol https://t.co/HimKE2VAD2— James Galante (@Galante97) July 7, 2020Nevertheless; altseason seems to be returning.

As CryptoSlate reported in 2018; over 600 cryptocurrencies are “deadcoins,” or projects that no longer feature any development, value, and have zero token activity.At the time, the metrics meant one in three ICOs was a dead project. Now, with over 2,600 cryptocurrencies as per CryptoSlate’s coin trackers, this number is ought to have changed.Deadcoins.com is a site dedicated to the cause. Its trackers show over 1,900 crypto projects are either dead, exit-scammed, or seen their developers abandon the project.Only time will tell if investors will be smarter this time or fall into a scam-trap again.(Author’s note: CryptoSlate data trackers are real-time are subject to change from the figures mentioned above.)

The cryptocurrency recently eclipsed $0.11, which is the highest price it has traded at in over a year and a half.With this latest move higher, ADA is easily outperforming a majority of other large-cap cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, and most other multi-billion-dollar assets in existence.Cardano’s ADA is now up more than 200 percent this yearAccording to crypto research firm Messari, ADA is up more than 200 percent since the start of 2020. This makes it the best-performing smart contract coin of the year, outpacing Vechain, Ethereum, Algorand, Tron, amongst countless other digital assets.Top 5 smart contract platforms by marketcap YTD$ADA +204%$VET +165%$ETH +78% $ALGO +50%$TRX +30% https://t.co/sGXKlHzYLJ— Messari (@MessariCrypto) July 6, 2020As aforementioned, a year-to-date performance in excess of 200 percent makes it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in general.It has only been eclipsed by decentralized finance coins, which are currently benefiting from an influx of adoption spurred by multi-million-dollar incentive systems. Doges ADA have room to appreciate?Despite it being up so far just six months into the year, there is data suggesting that Cardano has room to rally.Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock shared the chart below on Jul. 7, writing that its In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) indicator shows:“There is little resistance until $0.12380, where roughly 6.13k addresses had previously purchased 201.44 million ADA.”It was added that there is strong support in the $0.09-0.10 range, where there are over ten thousand holders holding over 1,000,000,000 ADA.IntoTheBlock’s Cardano In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOAMP) indicator current as of Jul. 7IntoTheBlock’s other metrics also seemingly suggest Cardano has room to rally.Below is an image of the firm’s Cardano dashboard, which shows seven separate core metrics in three categories: on-chain signals, spot exchange signals, and derivatives signals.Four out of the company’s seven core metrics are currently “bullish.” These are the in the money (momentum of addresses in profit), smart price (an implied price derived from order book data), bid-ask volume imbalance (the balance of buy orders vs. sell orders), and futures market momentum (tracks the price, open interest, and volume of derivatives markets).IntoTheBlock’s Cardano dashboard current as of Jul. 7Notably, coming up is Cardano’s mainnet launch of “Shelley.” Shelley is a phase of the blockchain’s life span that will begin to decentralize the network while increasing its usability with new code.The founder of the blockchain, Charles Hoskinson, believes that with Shelley, Cardano will begin to encroach on the market shares carved out by other smart contract blockchains like Ethereum. This should coincide with a rally in ADA’s price.But considering that the recent rally has been in anticipation of Shelley, there could be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario that plays out, thus depressing ADA in the near term.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

27,CryptoSlate,IOHK could demonstrate Cardano’s multi-asset standard with Presidential campaign coins for Kanye West and Brock Pierce,Priyeshu Garg,1594112400.0,"Cardano could see Presidential coins issued on its platform in order to demonstrate its multi-asset standard, Charles Hoskinson said in his latest AMA.IOHK is considering coins to commemorate Kanye West and Brock Pierce’s presidential campaigns.The coin itself wouldn’t be affiliated with Kanye, but the number of coins issues will match the number of votes he gets in the upcoming U.S. presidential elections. Hoskinson explained that they would be airdropped to all ADA holders after the election.This year’s most buzzworthy coinThe dust from the announcement of Kanye West’s presidential candidacy in the U.S. hasn’t even settled and the famous rapper has already become a household name in the crypto industry. While Kanye’s pro-cryptocurrency stance was known to many, it wasn’t until he made it clear that he was indeed running for election this year that the industry took notice.This is mostly due to the fact that news about a “Kanye Coin” seemed to spread faster than his candidacy announcement. The crypto media has been ablaze with news about the potential launch of West’s namesake coin that most missed the real story behind it.Namely, the upcoming Kanye Coin isn’t and probably won’t be directly affiliated with West himself, as it was envisioned more as a marketing tool to promote the Cardano blockchain.First announced by Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, the coin would be a fun way to demonstrate Cardano’s multi-asset standard and show the potential the blockchain has.Referring to West’s presidential, Hoskinson said:“If it’s not a joke, when Cardano has native assets, to demonstrate the power uniqueness of native assets, we will issue Kanye Coin.”One coin, one voteWhen it comes to the purpose of the Kanye Coin, Hoskinson said that it would be more of a collector’s item than a utility coin. The total supply of the coin wouldn’t be known until after the election, as one token would be issued for each vote that West gets in the election.Being collector’s items, the tokens wouldn’t be sold as it the case with most tokens but would be airdropped to all ADA holders.Demonstrating Cardano’s multi-asset standard wouldn’t end with the Kanye Coin, either. Hoskinson said in his YouTube AMA that the company might do the same for yet another U.S. presidential candidate—Brock Pierce.“So also to advertise our native asset standard, we will do the same for Brock Pierce—Pierce Coin and Kanye Coin.”This, Hoskinson went on, would be a great way of demonstrating the connection between cryptocurrencies and real-life events. However, to do so, IOHK will need to develop an oracle that would feed the results of the election into the Cardano blockchain.The oracle would most likely be released just ahead of the November elections, while the multi-asset standard is expected to launch in about four months.Posted In: Cardano, Adoption, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Current as of Jul. 5Data from Glassnode, another blockchain analytics firm, seemingly corroborates Santiment’s bearish tone.The company released the chart seen below on Jul. 5, showing that there has been a massive influx of LINK into Binance wallets sent in 5,000 different transactions:“Based on our exchange data, yesterday we observed almost 5,000 LINK transfers onto Binance wallets. This resulted in a daily net transfer volume into the exchange of more than $16 million USD worth of LINK – the largest we’ve seen so far.”Chainlink (LINK) net flow into Binance from Glassnode. Current as of Jul. 5It isn’t clear what happened to these coins afterward, but a holder of LINK can really only do one thing when sending their crypto to exchanges: sell.A recap of Chainlink’s bullish developmentsEven if LINK corrects, that doesn’t take away from the fundamental developments that the underlying Chainlink project has recently seen.As reported by this outlet previously, leading crypto-asset exchange Huobi revealed that it will be leveraging Chainlink nodes by integrating it into its wallet service. Huobi added that it will integrate its exchange data into Chainlink, allowing developers to leverage that data in smart contract applications.China’s Blockchain Service Network, the BSN, has also integrated Chainlink’s oracles. The network, which is in line with China’s pro-blockchain policy, is operated by China’s State Information Center, China Mobile, China Unionpay, and Red Date Technologies.

31,CryptoSlate,DeFi’s Compound (COMP) has crashed 50% in two weeks—and it may drop further,Nick Chong,1593910800.0,"When Ethereum-based finance protocol Compound launched its native token COMP in June, it traded at $30. But due to an influx of hype which was somewhat a byproduct of market illiquidity, the altcoin shot over 1,000 percent higher, reaching an all-time high price in excess of $350.Unfortunately for those who bought the COMP at the highs, the decentralized finance-centric ERC-20 token has since been subject to a steep retracement.According to CryptoSlate coin data, the cryptocurrency now trades for $185 as of this article’s writing. That is approximately 50 percent lower than COMP’s all-time high — and that loss has been realized just in two weeks.A large portion of these losses was incurred following the altcoin’s listing in Coinbase. Analysts have said that since Coinbase was one of the first “mainstream” crypto exchanges to list COMP, that was the first venue through which many holders could sell their coins.Investors in the cryptocurrency, unfortunately, may be subject to further losses as analysts have claimed that the DeFi token may be intrinsically overvalued.The Ethereum-based Compound (COMP) is poised to collapse, analysts sayEven after its 50 percent decline from the highs, Compound is still a massive cryptocurrency. CryptoSlate’s crypto leaderboard shows that the asset is the 28th largest digital asset in circulation — despite it being established in March and publicly launched in June.According to a new analysis by trader “Theta Seek,” who has closely tracked the DeFi boom, COMP may have further to fall. He released an extensive thread on his thoughts about the altcoin on Jul. 2nd.The premise of the thread was that he’s publicly short on COMP, writing that the “fundamentals of [Compound’s] ‘governance’, given the public information, don’t make too much sense today.” Theta added that he wouldn’t be surprised to see another 50 percent decline to take the cryptocurrency below $100.1/ I'm short on $COMP, the fundamentals of the 'governance', given the public information, don't make too much sense today.Won't be surprised to see it fall below $100 unless a revenue model is proposed soon. – Read full thread..— Theta Seek (@thetaseek) July 2, 2020Theta’s basic thesis came down to the fact that businesses with assets under management (AUM) — like funds, financial service providers, and so on — are “normally valued at less than 1/3 or 1/4” of its AUM figure.His example of this was BlockFi, which is valued at “around $200 million” despite it holding $650 million in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.At a price of ~$200, the fully diluted market capitalization of COMP is around $2 billion when the underlying Compound protocol only holds $1 billion. This led him to the conclusion:“IMHO, the fair value of the token, (assuming similar long term profitability as other crypto AUM businesses) should be at around $50 today.”Data shared by venture capitalist Julien Thevenard has seemingly corroborated this. He shared data on Jun. 21 indicating that COMP was trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 200 times.A price-to-earnings ratio is often used to value stocks. While COMP is not a stock, this method of valuation may suggest it is overvalued, as many companies trade in the 10-30 PE ratio range.Is DeFi a bubble?While there is evidence showing that COMP is likely to drop, not the same can be said about other Ethereum-based DeFi tokens.Crypto venture investor and analyst Andrew Kang released a 25-part thread on why DeFi isn’t in a bubble. As reported by CryptoSlate previously, Kang’s argument boiled down to a few main points:Ethereum DeFi still has less than one percent of the daily active users of ETH.Asian money, which largely drove 2017 and 2018’s altcoin mania, is starting to flood back into crypto, especially into DeFi.And there have been strong technological developments in this segment of the blockchain space.

The former returned over 800 percent to holders within two days of COMP issuance on June 18, eventually falling to $185-$190 level as on June 4.Up for the taking is “risk-free” returns of 10-120%. While 0x is nowhere close to such returns—it’s a project not governed by complex eternal factors, such as MakerDAO’s zero-fee DAI sales in March.After 0x’s beta staking launch in early-2020, holders have three main ways to lend their tokens. Previously, this was possible using some third-party protocols.Staking frenzy catches onData on Staking Rewards shows ZRX “delegates” stand to gain an annual reward of 0.51% with a lockup period of 14 days. “Liquidity pool” owners get 3.45% on a similar lockup, with a risk rating of “moderate.”(Source: Staking Rewards)On Compound, ZRX’s gross supply is over $42 million, up 0.4% since Friday.

34,CryptoSlate,Cardano parent signs a custody agreement with Coinbase to allow ADA staking,Priyeshu Garg,1593744120.0,"IOHK, the company behind the Cardano blockchain, has announced that it had signed an agreement with Coinbase Custody.

According to a press release shared with CryptoSlate, ADA holders will be able to store their assets in Coinbase Custody’s cold storage while maintaining the ability to delegate their stake.The partnership is set to alleviate the concerns U.S. regulators have about the security of cryptocurrencies, as IOHK believes this is what has previously hampered their ability to be accepted into mainstream finance.“With Cardano, we believe we can create a revolutionary solution which will be able to offer access to finance and investment to swathes of the population who have previously been shut out of the system”Sam McIngvale, the head of product at Coinbase Custody, said that the company has been closely following the success of the Cardano Incentivized Testnet and is looking forward to supporting the network.“We are overseen by the same regulators, and held to similar capital requirements and audit requirements as a traditional financial custodian, which removes many of the perceived barriers to global acceptance of crypto.”Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, said that the custody agreement with Coinbase will allow Cardano to offer the same secure storage that can be found in traditional finance, without sacrificing “what makes proof-of-stake blockchains special,” which is being able to participate in the network.The service will become available to all ADA users in Q4 2020, the company said in the announcement.Coinbase custody agreement may also pave the path for long-anticipated Cardano listing on Coinbase.Posted In: Cardano, Coinbase, Altcoins, Partnerships     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

35,CryptoSlate,"VC argues DeFi isn’t a bubble as Chainlink, Compound and more go parabolic",Nick Chong,1593747420.0,"If you’ve followed the crypto market over the past months, you’ve likely noticed what many others have: a majority of the best-performing altcoins are based on decentralized finance (DeFi).The image below from crypto analyst Taha Zafar depicts this trend well. While two weeks old, the table shows that as of the time of his analysis, DeFi coins were going parabolic.Bitcoin had posted a 90-day gain of 81 percent while Aave, Kyber Network, Loopring, Bancor, Maker, and Melon have all posted gains in excess of 100 percent.DeFi-focused coins not mentioned but have also gone parabolic over recent months include Chainlink, Synthetix, Compound, and Balancer.An Ethereum DeFi bubble?With the strong outperformance of these assets, many have started to “cry” bubble or at least have begun to argue that valuations are getting frothy.Weiss Crypto Ratings, market research firm Weiss Ratings’ cryptocurrency division, wrote on DeFi’s “ludicrous” growth:“DeFi is one of the most exciting things going on in crypto right now, but the idea that sector will decouple from the rest of the market is ludicrous. Eventually, the mania will end, and DeFi will trade in line with the rest of the market.”A venture capitalist, Julien Thevenard, also shared this data below on Jun. 21, lending to the idea that Ethereum’s DeFi sector might be a bubble currently in formation.The coins of DeFi protocols are trading at absurd price-to-earnings (PE) ratios of 100 to 4,360.While coins are not exactly like shares of traditional companies, value investors often avoid stocks with extremely high PE ratios. For further context, Investopedia reports that the average historical PE ratio of the S&P 500 has been 13~15.Compound valuation is clearly high compared to its earnings.

That’s to say, DeFi has exponential growth potential.  Heck, even one of Bitcoin’s biggest bulls, Chamath Palihapitiya, doesn’t know what DeFi is.Secondly, Kang noted that Asian money — which is what drove many altcoin crazes during the 2017/2018 bubble — is starting to “feel the FOMO.”And thirdly, DeFi development is “hitting an inflection point” with more on-chain liquidity, better development tools, successful case studies, education, and much more.The confluence of these trends, according to the investor, indicates that DeFi has room to grow in the long run.According to CryptoSlate data, DeFi tokens currently represent a $3.05 billion market or 1.17 percent of the entire cryptocurrency market cap.Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, DeFi     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

36,CryptoSlate,Compound users now supplying over $1 billion in ETH assets; COMP a top-25 altcoin,Shaurya Malwa,1593648300.0,"Compound’s meteoric rise in the crypto-space is coupled with the rise of DeFi tokens and retail traders chasing the next moonshot.COMP, Compound’s native token, rose over 600 percent from a listing price of $61 to over $350 on June 21, before steadily falling to its current $195 level.At press time, COMP is a top-25 altcoin, while the value of total assets locked in Compound exceeds $1.5 billion across supply and burrow pools.Compound locks $1 billionCompound touts itself as a decentralized lending pool and automated market maker, which in layman’s terms, means one can put up their crypto holdings for other traders to burrow and make money off — paying the lender a fee in return.This is similar to how banks operate. Yearly interest—oft in the range of 2-5 percent—is generated when an account holder’s money to shipped off in the banks’ name to loan seekers. The fees they pay are then siphoned to holder accounts, with banks taking a cut.While Compound is not a bank, provides a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing crypto assets. The interest rates are variable and fluctuate based on the supply and demand of the individual assets.And the community seems to have taken a liking. Total assets locked on Compound crossed over $1 billion last week and has gained another 30 million since. The snapshot below shows:Compound supply and burrow pools. (Source: Compound)Of that pool, Brave’s BAT token emerges as the top-choice pool token. Gross supply is over $326 million, with suppliers earning 14 percent and borrowers paying 33 percent APR.However, there are concerns about how BAT holdings and distributions are calculated. As CryptoSlate reported yesterday, a Compound pool voted for a new distribution system as concerns of illiquid and propped-up holdings rose, meaning BAT might not hold its position for long.COMP token surges, but there are concernsEach day, over 2,880 COMP are distributed to users of the protocol; the distribution is allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAI), proportional to the interest being accrued in that market, notes Compound.The token is traded mainly on DEXs like UniSwap, but last week saw mega-listings on Coinbase and FTX. The latter could have catalyzed COMP’s surge to $350.Yesterday, Korea’s OKEx listed the COMP token — possibly opening the gates for the second round of retail interest as the country’s rides on the DeFi mania.Meanwhile, not all are convinced with how Compound, and the broader DeFi market, is shaping up. This cohort includes Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who has chimed in the crypto community’s fascination with “yield farming” in recent times:Honestly I think we emphasize flashy defi things that give you fancy high interest rates way too much.

That metric is up to 66 percent from the ~35 percent lows set at the peak of 2018’s crypto bubble.Bitcoin dominance chart from TradingView.comThe poor performances of altcoins are even more striking when you look at it from an asset-to-asset level.Ethereum now trades at $230, down nearly 85 percent from its all-time high. XRP is down more than 90 percent from its all-time high above $3.00. And that’s just two assets out of many.Yet there remain a few altcoins that are actually in the green on a macro scale, strongly outperforming even Bitcoin.Despite the crypto crash, there are some ICOs that have yielded thousands of percentAccording to data compiled by crypto data analyst Vivek, there are multiple ICOs, such as Cardano and Binance Coin, that have strongly outperformed Bitcoin over recent years, despite the altcoin crash.Comparing the price of a number of altcoins at ICO to their current prices, he gave the following information:Ethereum is the best-performing ICO with a 77,800 percent gainNEO comes in second with 5,200 percentIn third is Chainlink, up 4,800 percent from ICO.And so on and so forth.The ICO's with the highest ROI: Ethereum (77,800%), NEO (5200%), Chainlink (4800%), Stratis (4800%), Komodo?? (3500%), Cardano (3300%), Augur (3000)%. BNB and IOTA also in the mix.— Vivek (@realvivek_) June 23, 2020Importantly, for most of the crypto assets listed except Chainlink, their  gains from ICO were even higher at the peak of the 2018 bull market.The days of parabolic altcoin gains may be gone — mostly gone, anywayAlthough it’s nice to look back on these gains, the days of ICOs and altcoins rallying tens of thousands of percent are most likely gone. Well, at least mostly gone.This can be attributed to the fact that many investors have largely woken up to the fact that many altcoins, especially those launched in 2017/2018, are intrinsically worthless and thus have been poor investments. Jason Calacanis — an angel investor in Robinhood, Trello, Uber, and other tech giants — recently said that he’s bearish on a large majority of cryptocurrencies:“Historically, 99% of crypto projects are garbage run by unqualified idiots, delusional but below average founders or grifters… the 1% that are not, could change the world.

This is similar to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum.Unfortunately for ADA holders, data from a top blockchain analytics firm accentuates that a further move lower is likely.IntoTheBlock data shows Cardano could be primed for a correctionAccording to data shared by blockchain data firm IntoTheBlock on Jun. 24, Cardano is “mostly bearish” from an on-chain and exchange data standpoint.The firm’s dashboard suggests that four core metrics of Cardano are currently “bearish.” One of the other core metrics is “bullish” while the remaining two are “netural.” The “bearish” metrics identified by IntoTheBlock are the following:Concentration: The status of large holders of a cryptocurrency (if “whales” are buying, it’s bullish; if they’re selling, it’s bearish).Large transactions: The number of transactions valued at over $100,000.Smart price: An alternative valuation metric derived from the composition of buy and sell orders of a cryptocurrency.Bid-ask volume imbalance: The volume at the bid price vs. the volume at the ask price.Movements in on-chain and exchange data notably do not always correspond with price action.Also bearish is ADA’s exchange volume.As reported by CryptoSlate on Jun. 22, analytics platform Coinalyze reported that volume for Cardano futures and options on Binance, FTX, HuobiDM, and OKEx have dropped over recent weeks.Data via CoinalyzeThis suggests that the buying strength that has boosted the altcoin over recent weeks is tapering out.Bitcoin is also bearish, analyst saysThe bearish outlook for Cardano is reflected in that of Bitcoin.

Coin Metrics, in fact, is currently registering a 0.84 correlation between the price of ADA and the price of BTC.On-chain analyst Cole Garner recently aggregated a number of reasons why Bitcoin is likely to see a retracement from the $9,000s.1/ I am massively bullish on #Bitcoin, but I think the next big move is likely down.@glassnode just reported the largest $BTC transfer from miners to exchanges in over a year. pic.twitter.com/Uwj4hHveyx— Cole Garner (@ColeGarnerBTC) June 24, 2020Firstly, Glassnode recently reported that there have been massive withdrawals from Bitcoin miners to exchange wallets. This suggests miners expect downside in the near future and are cashing out ASAP to remain profitable/afloat.Secondly, institutions are largely bearish according to the CME Bitcoin futures data. Institutional traders previously predicted other downturns, increasing their short positions via the CME prior to the dump to $3,700 in March or the correction after Bakkt’s launch last year.And lastly, Bitfinex’s “order book delta has been skewed massively to the sell-side for almost six weeks.” This delta, Garner explained, has been an “accurate leading indicator of BTC’s next move nearly every swing for the past nine months.”Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
41,CryptoSlate,"Why Cardano’s Ouroboros will be a game changing protocol, according to its chief scientist",Priyeshu Garg,1593079200.0,"Cardano’s proof-of-stake protocol is set to bring about unprecedented decentralization, but the mechanisms that drive it are still a mystery to many. Cardano’s chief scientist professor Aggelos Kiayias dove deep into Ouroboros and detailed the principles on which the ambitious protocol is based on.The problem of building decentralized systemsPersistence and liveness—these are the hallmarks of successful distributed ledger systems, according to professor Aggelos Kiayias, the chief scientist at Cardano. However, it seems that systems based on the simplest premises are the hardest ones to deliver.Kiayias dove deep into the problems decentralized systems face and provided a detailed view on how Cardano’s Ouroboros managed to solve those problems.The persistence and liveness he mentioned are a promise of a consistent view to all participants of a system and a guarantee of responsiveness to the continuous flow of events that result from their actions. This is fairly straightforward and easy to achieve in a centralized system, but gives the system a single point of failure and makes it vulnerable to attacks.Designing a robust decentralized system is a much more complex task, as they require developing models that systematically encompass all the different threats the system might encounter and prove that both persistence and liveness are upheld at all times.Therefore, a well-designed decentralized system will continue to function even if some of the parties in it deviate from proper operation. The system should be designed in such a way that it could handle even more significant deviations in its operation without suffering too much damage.A reliable decentralized system would combine formal guarantees against various types of failure and attack models, with the biggest and most important class of failure being the Byzantine models.Byzantine models guarantee that the persistence and liveness of the system will be maintained even if a large part of participants in the network arbitrarily deviate from the network’s rules. The second, but equally important class is models of rationality, which assumes that all participants of the network are rational utility maximizers which is why the properties of the system should arise from their pursuit of self-interest.Analyzing Ouroboros through two types of behaviorAccording to Kiayias, what makes Ouroboros unique as a protocol is the fact that it combines various design elements that consider both Byzantine and rational behaviors described above.Namely, Ouroboros uses stake as the primary resource to identify the leverage participants have in the system. Apart from being resistant to attacks native to Proof-of-Work protocols, such as the 51 percent attack, staking makes Ouroboros more environmentally friendly as it requires minimal physical resources to run.Ouroboros also guarantees the dynamic availability a proof-of-work system never could—Kiayias said that the protocol continues to operate even if an arbitrarily large number of participants decide not to stake and maintain the ledger.“Of those participants who are active, barely more than half need to follow the protocol—the rest can arbitrarily deviate,” he wrote in the blog post.In fact, Ouroboros could even tolerate spikes above the 50 percent threshold as long as they don’t last too long. This flexibility allows Ouroboros to be more resilient and adaptable than the classical Byzantine fault tolerance protocols and their model adaptations. These protocols need to have a relatively certain prediction of the participation they expect from the network in order to work—any deviation could easily cause them to stop operating.Another thing that sets Ouroboros apart from other PoS protocols is its trustlessness. Kiayias explained that the process of joining and participating in the protocol doesn’t require the availability of any special shared resource such as a checkpoint. When engaging in the protocol requires nothing more than the public genesis block of the chain and access to the network, it eliminates the point of failure that is a trusted shared resource.But, no matter how advanced these features are, it takes more than a well-designed network to attract users. This is something that IOHK spent a lot of time and effort on when designing Shelley, Cardano’s proof-of-stake era. Knowing that a well-oiled machine is essentially worthless without someone driving it, Cardano introduced a fairly advanced rewards mechanism.While payouts for those staking their coins on the network are nothing new, Ouroboros incorporated a reward-sharing mechanism that incentivized network participants to organize themselves in operational nodes. These nodes, known to most as stake pools, offer a quality of service independently of how stake is distributed among the user population, Kiayias said:“In this way, all stakeholders contribute to the system’s operation – ensuring robustness and democratic representation – while the cost of ledger maintenance is efficiently distributed across the user population.”However, encouraging the creation of organizations can inadvertently lead to centralization. This wasn’t overlooked when designing Ouroboros, which comes with its own set of countermeasures that de-incentivize centralization. With a tight control over stake pools, the protocol prevents a situation in which only a handful of operators would be responsible for maintaining the blockchain.There’s more to Ouroboros than meets the eyeWhile the developments inside Cardano seem to be happening at lightning speed recently, in reality, work on the protocol began all the way back in 2015 when the blockchain was first announced. Scratching the surface reveals an almost incredible amount of research that went into Ouroboros, which is something Kiayias proudly described in his post.He noted that the design elements of Ouroboros were never to be self-evident to the average protocol user. Instead, they were delivered in peer-reviewed papers with meticulous documentation attached to them. All of the papers published on Cardano, of which there are so far more than 50, have appeared both in conferences and publications in the area of cryptography and cybersecurity.Each of those papers is explicit about the specific types of models used to analyze the protocol and lays out the results derived from them in concrete terms.“Building an inclusive, fair and resilient infrastructure for financial and social applications on a global scale is the grand challenge of information technology today.”This is why Ouroboros is considered to be a game-changing protocol in the industry—not only does it present unique characteristics available to all through its open-source code, but also in presenting a design methodology that highlights first principles, modeling, and analysis.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Opinion, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

42,CryptoSlate,Stellar (XLM) based Akon’s Akoin to digitize medical access in Rwanda,Priyeshu Garg,1593064920.0,"Akoin, the Stellar (XLM) based blockchain network and cryptocurrency developed by artist Akon, has partnered with healthcare solution provider Jeev to help improve access to healthcare to millions of people in Rwanda and the rest of Africa.In a press release shared with CryptoSlate, the company said that it plans to digitize patient health interactions by putting them on a blockchain.Akon’s blockchain company plans on digitizing healthcare in AfricaAkoin, a digital asset platform founded by global artist and crypto investor Akon, has been expanding its presence in Africa in the past few months, a move that has pushed the company out of relative obscurity into the forefront of blockchain development on the continent.And now, the company has turned to healthcare by establishing a partnership with Jeev, a blockchain-based platform used to connect patients with healthcare professionals.The company said that the partnership is a natural extension of Akoin’s goal to improve social opportunities and access to financial services to countries across the African continent.The partnership will allow Jeev to use the Stellar-based Akoin token to provide its blockchain-based medical service for digitizing healthcare across the entire patient life-cycle—from in-person interactions with doctors and patient records, to diagnostics.Dr. Sanjeev Kaila, a U.S.-based surgeon and founder of Jeev, said that the Akoin token will power all of the financial and reward exchanges throughout the Jeev platform and enable the service to expand its reach across Africa:“Offering the Jeev application within the Akoin platform extends our reach beyond Rwanda into other countries throughout Africa, together improving the quality and cost of healthcare in developing countries.”Akoin’s powerful relationships across AfricaJon Karas, the co-founder and current president of Akoin, said the company was very proud of its partnership with Jeev and was looking forward to bringing digital healthcare services to the broader masses together.When considering what the best way to make the biggest social impact is, Akoin looked at businesses and business models that allowed both for growth and sustainability. Jeev, Karas said, was a natural choice as it enabled Akoin to provide and scale healthcare services to critically underserved areas of Africa.Akoin has been establishing major partnerships across Africa—it announced that it was to become the main currency for the Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC) in Western Kenya earlier this year and has pushed forward with the plans to build the eponymous Akon City in Senegal.The company awarded the contract for building and executing the $6 billion futuristic city to KE International, a U.S.-based consulting and engineering firm. The firm, which secured $4 billion from investors for the first and second phases of Akon City, was also responsible for the design and execution of the Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC), set to be completed in December 2020.Posted In: Stellar, Africa, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

43,CryptoSlate,Industry exec believes Cardano (ADA) will be the fifth-largest crypto in 2021,Nick Chong,1592902140.0,"There was a time when Cardano’s ADA was a top-ten cryptocurrency.At the peak of 2018’s bubble, the altcoin was trading above $1.00. That coincided with a market capitalization of over $30 billion. At the time, Cardano’s market cap was the size of a mid-large-cap company.Things have changed though as value has consolidated in tried-and-true players like XRP, Litecoin, and Binance Coin.ADA is now the eleventh largest cryptocurrency and was even lower down on the list just months ago.Yet an executive says that this weakness is unlikely to last, especially with the Shelley upgrade nearing.ADA could be a top-five crypto asset by 2021: executiveRyan Selkis, CEO of Messari, says that he thinks the top ten cryptocurrencies will get a facelift in 2021 as “real garbage” has once again populated the industry.He expects the third-largest cryptocurrency to the tenth-largest, which means Tether’s USDT, XRP, and others, to all be replaced by other projects. All but Binance Coin, which he expects to remain a top altcoin.Of note, he believes ADA will become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. At current prices, the asset taking that seat would require its market capitalization to double to $4.5 billion.Cardano will need to encroach on EthereumCardano’s growth will be dependent on it beating out other blockchains, according to Charles Hoskinson.The Cardano founder told the executive in a recent June interview that Ethereum is not yet at a point where it will decisively become the leading smart contract blockchain.Hoskinson went as far as to say that Cardano and other networks/technologies can begin to nip away at the incumbent.This comment was made in reference to Cardano’s Shelley upgrade. The blockchain upgrade, which is its “Ethereum 2.0” moment so to say, will purportedly increase its usability exponentially. Whether it can be pulled off and if ADA will see adoption remains to be seen though.Cardano’s success is also put into question because the launch of Ethereum 2.0 is also nearing.That upgrade is expected to be a big market catalyst for ETH, with one branding it the largest economic shift in crypto ever.Not the only one expecting a crypto shake-upSelkis is notably not the only executive expecting a shake-up in the top cryptocurrencies. Though, the Messari founder seems to be one of the only investors expecting Cardano to take a top seat.The co-founder of crypto research firm Blockfyre and a fund/advisory called MoonRock Capital, Simon Dedic, recently commented:“I will get some serious hate for that, but I stand by my opinion: XRP, BCH, BSV, LTC, and EOS absolutely do NOT deserve belonging to the TOP 10 cryptocurrencies.”I will get some serious hate for that, but I stand by my opinion:$XRP, $BCH, $BSV, $LTC and $EOS absolutely do NOT deserve belonging to the TOP 10 cryptocurrencies.Actually can't wait until they vanish and clear the way for solid candidates like $VET, $LINK, $XTZ or $ATOM.— Simon Dedic (@scoinaldo) June 21, 2020His comment indicated he harbors no animosity towards Cardano, but he did say that he expects Vechain, Chainlink, Tezos, and Cosmos to encroach on the incumbents.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Analysis, People     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

44,CryptoSlate,Chainlink daily transfers rocket by 40% — what on-chain metrics are saying,Cole Petersen,1592906400.0,"The entire crypto market has been able to incur some notable upwards momentum today, and Chainlink appears to be leading the charge.Its ongoing upswing comes after a long-held bout of sideways trading and has allowed it to begin ascending up towards its previously established all-time highs.This newfound momentum is not unwarranted either, as the token has seen a massive spike in the number of transfers taking place over the past 24 hours. This seems to point towards a rise in organic trading volume.Other on-chain metrics that provide insight into the cryptocurrency’s fundamental strength are flashing positive signs as well. One such metric would be the growth seen while looking towards the number of active LINK wallet addresses over the past few months.Chainlink sees sudden surge in daily transfers, pointing to rise in organic trading volumeChainlink has led the market’s upswing today, with its 24-hour gains only being rivaled by those seen by Ethereum.At the time of writing, LINK is trading up just under six percent at its current price of $4.41. The token is only trading down roughly ten percent from its previously established all-time highs, and it is possible that buyers will soon target these levels.It is important to note that the ongoing upswing is being driven by overt fundamental strength.One metric indicating this is a sharp rise seen while looking towards the number of LINK transfers that have taken place over the past 24-hours.According to data from analytics platform Glassnode, this metric has increased by 40 percent over the past 24-hours.“LINK Number of Transfers (1d MA) increased significantly in the last 24 hours. Current value is 437.792 (up 38.5% from 316.042).”Image Courtesy of GlassnodeThis indicates that strong organic trading volume is driving this movement.LINK daily active address count caught within strong mid-term uptrend Another metric signaling that Chainlink’s bullish price action is warranted is the mid-term uptrend its daily active address count has been caught within.Data from blockchain visualization tool IntoTheBlock reveals this, showing that the cryptocurrency’s active address count has climbed from yearly lows of roughly 1,000 to nearly 4,000 currently.Image Courtesy of IntoTheBlockThis growth, coupled with the ongoing rise in transactional volume, seems to point towards a major escalation in trading activity amongst its investors.The next heavy resistance region that investors should closely watch sits between $4.80 and $5.00, which is where it set its all-time highs earlier this year.Whether or not its current fundamental strength is enough to thwart a selloff at this level will be telling as to the state of its macro-uptrend.Posted In: Chainlink, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Popular games, both on computer and mobile, feature in-game currencies that are extensively used.  CryptoSlate caught up with Craig Russo (CR), the Director of Innovation at Polyient Games, discussing digital assets, their fit in the blockchain games, and what the future holds for such applications.NFTs and gamesCS: What is Polyient Games? How does it fit into the expanding blockchain gaming ecosystem?CR: Polyient Games is the first investment firm and startup ecosystem wholly dedicated to the blockchain gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) markets.[Our] investment strategy is focused on startups building the infrastructure and applications necessary to scale the NFT asset class.The Polyient Games Ecosystem is an upcoming collaborative environment consisting of portfolio startups, stakeholders, and third-party organizations, providing unique tools, products, and services to support members while driving forward NFT adoption via the Polyient Games Marketplace.CS: How is gaming being disrupted by blockchain technology?CR: In the current system, items purchased within games are not freely transferrable, meaning gamers are unable to take true ownership of these itemsWith blockchain games, these items are pegged to tokens that open up a new economic model that allows gamers to offset their gaming expenses or even earn money through diligent gameplay.CS: Why are more gaming companies embracing blockchain technology?CR: Mainstream gaming is far from adopting blockchain technology, as there are significant steps remaining to onboard both publishers and gamers.The current technical barriers are far too steep for mainstream gamers to play blockchain games and the incentives are not strong enough for mainstream publishers to begin incorporating blockchain technology into their well-established development pipelines.Blockchain gaming is very much still an indie game category, but it is exciting to see some major groups like Ubisoft exploring the new technologies.CS: What gaming companies are part of the Polyient Games growing gaming ecosystem?CR: We have been blown away by the interest and excitement coming from the blockchain gaming community around our upcoming Ecosystem and are excited to share that a number of leading blockchain games have already committed to joining.Some names we can share include Ethereum-based games Axie Infinity and Battle Racers. We have also invested in Blockade Games, the team behind the upcoming MMO Neon District.It's #EatYourVegetablesDay! 🥬 Did you know carrots are good for your eyes? 🥕 With better vision, it'll be easier to keep your eyes on the finish line. 👀Play now: https://t.co/zQL2rPXrTK or on @decentraland (66,-22)Register for the Duel Cup Open: https://t.co/ZeVoGTmjFS pic.twitter.com/Caz5D1yeDj— Battle Racers (@BattleRacers) June 17, 2020CS: How are blockchain games enabling gamers to earn real money while they play?CR: By selling NFT items they level-up or earn while playing the games on secondary markets.

47,CryptoSlate,Cardano (ADA) trading volume craters as on-chain data points to weakness,Cole Petersen,1592820000.0,"Cardano (ADA) has seen some intense gains over the past few months, with its recovery from its March lows far outpacing that seen by both Bitcoin and most of its other peers.This upwards momentum has shown some signs of stalling as of late, however, as the cryptocurrency has not been able to break above a key resistance level that halted its rally in late-May.Investors now appear to be showing some signs of losing interest in the cryptocurrency, with its trading volume cratering over the past several days and weeks.This comes as on-chain indicators also flash some warning signs for what could come next.One such warning sign would be the massive decline seen in the number of active ADA wallet addresses. This metric is pointing to severe underlying weakness amongst the digital asset’s buyers.Cardano trading volume see sharp decline as price enters consolidation phaseCardano’s price rallied to highs of nearly $0.09 earlier this month before facing some intense resistance.From this point, it declined to lows of $0.07 before entering a consolidation channel. At the present moment, ADA is trading up over 2% at its current price of $0.08, marking a slight outperformance of Bitcoin.The uptrend Cardano has seen over the past several months has been intense, leading it up from yearly lows of roughly $0.02.This climb was driven by a massive influx of volume from traders, but it is now showing signs of faltering.According to data from analytics platform Coinalyze, trading volume for ADA futures and options across Binance, FTX, HuobiDM, and OKEx have all cratered over the past few weeks.This trend is clearly elucidated while looking towards the below chart:Data via CoinalyzeADA active address data seems to paint a grim picture for its underlying strengthIn tandem with this declining volume, Cardano’s number of active wallet addresses has also plunged.According to data from blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, the number of active ADA addresses reached a local peak on May 31st, hitting a high of 19,580.This number has been declining ever since, and just hit 7,570 today.Data via IntoTheBlockOther metrics of its on-chain strength have declined as well, including the number of new addresses and the cryptocurrency’s large transaction volume.All of this points to a notable slowdown in the cryptocurrency’s uptrend.Unless Bitcoin exits its current trading range and proceeds to climb higher, it does not appear that Cardano’s buyers have enough underlying strength to further extend its momentum independent of the rest of the market.

The outspoken creator of Cardano said that it has been incredibly gratifying to see the products of five years of painstaking work finally come together all at once.This year has been going great, he said, as the company has been hitting all of the benchmarks and deadlines it set. The same couldn’t be applied to the past two years, Hoskinson explained, as Cardano kept facing hurdles on every corner. These hurdles, which were a consequence of having two separate teams working on Cardano simultaneously, helped it become notorious for being “slow.”Nowadays, however, speed and efficiency seem to be the only epithets that could describe developments at Cardano. Hoskinson said that the mainnet candidate for Shelley will be shipped as early as Jun. 30 if everything goes well with the testnet. Shelley will be turned on on Jul. 29, while all registered staking pools will be able to begin mining pools as early as Aug. 18.To fill up a tiny open slot between major releases, IOHK organized the Cardano virtual summit, which will take place on Jul. 2 and Jul. 3. The event, Hoskinson revealed, will see everyone from heads of state and government officials to partners from the Wyoming research lab and IOHK’s commercial partners come together to discuss Shelley. But, with most of the major points of the impending mainnet launch already covered, the speakers will also focus on Cardano after Shelley—its UTXO, Plutus, smart contracts, etc.Cardano virtual summit will also host one of  the founders of the internet—Vint Cerf.An upper hand built on formal methodsNone of this happened overnight—Hoskinson explained that Cardano began its journey with a competitive advantage provided by the Haskell programming language. While using Haskell requires a huge up front in terms of tooling and development cost, it pays out later as it requires 5 to 10 timeless less code than C++ or Java programming languages do.“Haskell developers aren’t JavaScript kitties,” he said, but serious professionals with PhDs, some with over 25 years of experience working for the financial sector.This kind of research-first approach enabled IOHK to harness good ideas from the entirety of the scientific community, instead of relying on a single, closed-off group of scientists. This can only lead to the creation of a closed-off system that cannot support cross-chain communication and is a mistake of the 1990s that shouldn’t be repeated.Diversity of thought is what facilitated a rather unusual approach to Cardano’s development. The team working on Goguen, the era of Cardano that will bring about smart contracts, has been around for three years, despite smart contracts still being months away.“They weren’t waiting for Shelley to be done,” Hoskinson said, adding that they have been developing their code parallel to Shelley.  The University of Lancaster saw their first papers on Voltaire, the governance era of Cardano, published around the same time.It took years to formally model Cardano of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work, despite the many shortcomings of the protocol, he told Selkis. Nonetheless, with all its flaws and limitations, proof-of-work actually provided Cardano’s own Ouroboros protocol both with solid fundamentals and the ability to introduce incredible innovations.This, Selkis noted, is what many believe gives Cardano an upper hand over its competitors, the main one being Ethereum. But, despite its obvious “upper hand,” Selkis believes that Cardano still has a long way to catch up to Ethereum’s network effect. History, he said, seems littered with examples of superior technology losing the race to technology with better network effects.Hoskinson met the remark with a good deal of annoyance and just a little bit of animosity, not towards Ethereum, but the rhetoric that puts network effect above science.“It’s the biggest lie ever told in the space.”There’s no network effect on Ethereum, he explained, not because Ethereum is inherently bad, but because the crypto industry is still so small that it’s virtually pointless to speculate on its effects. For every one dApp created on Ethereum, another thousand are created for mobile phones, a comparison that puts the network’s size into perspective. Being a big fish is, after all, relative:“You’re a big fish in a very tiny pod next to the ocean.”He went on to explain that not a single project in the crypto industry has managed to achieve network effect so far and that it will take another decade before any one of them manages to.This isn’t theory however—Hoskinson went on to explain that the winning blockchain will be the one that best connects on and off chain and maximizes flexibility. Only a flexible blockchain whose protocol facilitates easy onboarding and offloading will be able to host what the industry refers to as “killer apps.” These killer apps, in his words, won’t be payment services, but supply chains, medical records, identity solutions, and voting solutions.Coexisting, peer review, and plans after ShelleyWith this in mind, it’s not at all surprising to hear Hoskinson say that we’re heading towards a world where a fully grown Cardano and a fully grown Ethereum can easily coexist. Any talk of one taking over the other is futile and leads to a toxic and unproductive environment no one can thrive in.“It’s like 1991 internet now—we don’t even have the web browser, we don’t even have JavaScript right now. We don’t have incentives for people to adopt this particular technology right now.”That isn’t to say that Cardano is heading into the battle unarmed.When asked about how IOHK backs some of the claims it makes about Cardano, such as the protocol being “provably secure,” Hoskinson defended the company’s rigorous screening process.Calling Cardano “provably secure” doesn’t mean that other proof-of-stake protocols aren’t—it means that peer-reviewed scientific research found proof that the protocol is able to defend itself from a particular adversary. The original paper that modelled Cardano after Bitcoin’s proof-of-work has over 800 citations, providing the company with a rock-solid foundation both in the academic and crypto circles.All of the paper submitted by IOHK or any of its partnering organizations or scientists have been peer-reviewed, Hoskinson said, taking a jab at the self-proclaimed creator of Bitcoin:“When we write these papers we don’t just write them and say ‘Here’s the paper, we’ve solved the problem.’ We’re not Craig Wright.”These peer-reviewed, formally modeled proofs used in Cardano have for sure been an ambitious goal. But, both Hoskinson and the rest of the small army of people working on Cardano seem to be incredibly confident that they will be able to reap success.He laid out big plans for the next couple of years, with the first major thing they want to focus on issuing assets on Cardano. The existing ecosystem already supports much of the functionality Hoskison would like to see out of this, which is automatic Daedalus support for tokens and an easy way to deploy tokens on exchanges that already list ADA.The second thing will be making a major play for the Haskell community as a whole and getting them into the Cardano ecosystem. An influx of experienced and ambitious Haskell developers would enable a rich DeFi system to flourish on Cardano, as the blockchain operates from a native Haskell base. More about this will be discussed at the upcoming virtual summit, Hoskinson said, hinting that there will be talks about upcoming hackathons.And finally, onboarding more stake pool operators to Cardano will be a major goal for the company in the coming months. Hoskinson said that he would like to see people running sustainable businesses on Cardano’s servers, an adoption effort that will most likely first catch on in developing regions such as Africa.The interview ended on a positive note, with Hoskinson announcing a “pleasant surprise” for everyone regarding the first governance vote set to unravel during the virtual summit.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, People, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

49,CryptoSlate,Cardano (ADA) Shelley Haskell testnet finally gets its own Daedalus Wallet,Priyeshu Garg,1592442000.0,"Cardano (ADA) parent—IOHK has announced that it has released a version of Daedalus for the Shelley testnet. The lightweight Cardano wallet version 1.0.0-STN1 was designed purely for stake pool operator testing and is the first out of many Daedalus releases that is compatible with the Shelly (Haskell) testnet.Stake pool operators can now test the Haskell version of the Daedalus WalletLess than two weeks after opening up the Shelley testnet to all stake pool operators, IOHK has released new functionality for operators to test. According to the company’s announcement, the first Daedalus version for the Shelley testnet was just released. This marks the beginning of a long line of iterations that will be released on the testnet and will eventually become the wallet that all ADA holders will use on the mainnet.We've just released our first version of Daedalus for the Shelley testnet. This first version is available just for stake pool operators for early functional testing (via GitHub download). Here's the lowdown https://t.co/tFeOZTw9hP pic.twitter.com/jPcZiaRkvA— Input Output (@InputOutputHK) June 16, 2020The newly released version of the wallet, Daedalus 1.0.0-STN1, will offer only basic functionality in order to allow stake pool operators to test it. This release also won’t affect those currently holding ADA, with IOHK saying that they don’t need to do anything for now.Delegating and transacting on Shelley through DaedalusThe Haskell-optimized Daedalus will allow users to create, delete, and restore Shelley wallets, as well as transact on the network. Funding the Shelley wallet will be available through the Shelley Testnet faucet.When it comes to accessing Daedalus, IOHK noted that it is only available via the company’s GitHub repository and won’t be open for the general ADA holder. However, future versions of Daedalus will be available through the usual web download.The company encouraged all interested stake pool operators to download and try the latest version of Daedalus. This, they said in a blog post, will enable the company to get invaluable early input for developing the following versions of Daedalus.These versions will be released during the Shelley rollout and introduce new features such as viewing stake pools, delegating stake, and checking earned rewards. Support for legacy Byron wallets will also be introduced eventually, allowing users to move their funds from legacy Byron wallets to the new Shelley wallets.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

As Shelley, the era of the network set to bring about staking, is being thoroughly tested, the company’s weekly product update has continued the streak of positive reviews and promising launches.According to the company’s latest update, there has been an overwhelming response from stake pool operators who have joined the testnet after a select group of “pioneers” have gone through all of the network’s functions.Four days into the testnet, IOHK reported that there were almost 200 stake pools running on the Shelley testnet. While some of the pioneers that have joined the network have set up more than one pool, the company said that this was still a major achievement for the network:“But to see this number already is testament to the competency and commitment of the Cardano community and the experience we all gained through the build-out of the ITN in the early part of this year.”Cardano’s latest product update keeps the good news comingCharles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, praised the new operators and the effort they’ve put in, saying that, come August, there will be hundreds of operators running the network. In a few years, he added, there will be thousands of them.https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1272191536437039104Hoskinson’s optimistic attitude towards Cardano isn’t baseless, either—the development team has been churning out major updates throughout the past week and has set quite a busy schedule for the weeks ahead.Most of the development effort last week was focused on the wallet release, set for next week. The wallet back end team has been implementing a set of features that will, in time, allow Shelley functionality within the Daedalus Wallet. Next week, a test wallet will be released to the pioneer stake pools for backend integration testing, IOHK said.Once the pioneers have tested out features such as creating wallets and funding pledge addresses, other ADA holders will be able to try out the wallet. While the company plans on starting slowly, it said that UI features for Shelley could be implemented sooner than expected. Aside from the wallet, minor updates on the Node CLI  and cardano-db-sync have been made.The next week will mark the beginning of a migration towards a testnet that everyone can get involved with, IOHK said in the product update.Posted In: Cardano, Adoption, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

The rising interest in the promising blockchain platform follows the rise in the network’s on-chain strength and major developments coming from IOHK, all of which indicate that ADA could be up for a bull rally.More people than ever are talking about CardanoWhile the promises made by the platform have remained the same in the past five years, it seems that it took time for Cardano to become the talk of the town. Shelley, the network update that will bring about staking to the platform, is now closer than ever, and will finally pull Cardano from the realm of possibility and push it right at the forefront of the crypto market.The testnet for Shelley was opened to all stake pool operators earlier this week, bringing a lot of attention to the platform.Data from analytics company LunarCRUSH showed that almost 6,000 social media posts mentioning Cardano were published in the past 24 hours alone.

This count has seen near consistent growth since the 2018 bubble, according to the firm’s data.This indicates that ADA is becoming less and less concentrated over time, showing that the coins are leaving the hands of whales and going into the hands of more retail users. That isn’t to say that institutional money is ignoring Cardano—as reported by CryptoSlate, the latest ADA surge was most likely fueled by large investors. Data from IntoTheBlock showed that $7 billion worth of ADA, which is more than 300 percent larger than its current market capitalization, was transacted by large-size holders on May 31 alone.Furthermore, three of the company’s seven core metrics — Net Network Growth, Smart Price, and the Bid/Ask Volume Imbalance — are currently “bullish,” adding to Cardano’s bull case.

53,CryptoSlate,Sparks fly as developer suggests an altcoin will overtake Bitcoin in the next five years,Nick Chong,1591691760.0,"Although it may seem like Bitcoin has led the crypto market over the past few months, altcoins have strongly outperformed BTC since the start of 2020.A prominent analyst in the space shared the chart below, noting how FTX’s three altcoin indexes — the small-cap, medium-cap, and large-cap indexes — have registered better performances than BTC since the start of the year.FTX’s “SHIT” index, for instance, is up 80 percent in the past five months alone.Bitcoin vs. low-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap altcoins chart from analyst Ceteris ParibusThe strong performance of altcoins seems to be related to the fact that they were crushed heavily in 2018 and 2019, and thus, were poised to recover after being so oversold. “[The bounce] isn’t too surprising given how far altcoins fell versus bitcoin over the past couple years,” the analyst who shared the above chart opined.What comes next for altcoins though isn’t clear. A popular developer in the space expects Bitcoin’s dominance over the crypto market to end, while others strongly beg to differ.“This is the last time” Bitcoin will be worth this much against altcoins: developerOn Jun. 8, lead developer at crypto data site Blockchair and a writer of Bitcoin privacy and scaling articles, Nikita Zhavoronkov, released a 20-part thread on why he thinks “this is the last time we see Bitcoin’s dominance level above 66 percent.”Zhavoronkov added that within the next five years, he thinks BTC to lose its seat as the top cryptocurrency to an altcoin. For some context, Ethereum is currently the closest to doing that, and it’s around $150 billion away.Bitcoin dominance chart annotated by Nikita ZhavoronkovThe core of his argument came down to the fact that the “cool features” that cryptocurrency users want, such as privacy technologies and smart contracts, have not yet been integrated into Bitcoin.He added that the Proof of Work system that Bitcoin enlists is “flawed” because “miners aren’t interested in price increases, while they fear sharp declines.”The Lightning Network too, he explained, is “total vaporware” with “fundamental flaws” and no “actual real-world usage.” This has resulted in Bitcoin fee issues, as we saw a few weeks earlier, that will force investors to an asset like Ethereum:“In order to overthrow Bitcoin, Ethereum needs to grow just 6x compared to Bitcoin. Not at all an impossible scenario (we’re in crypto, remember?). What happens if Ethereum switches to PoS, scales, and becomes #1?”Bitcoin community lashes out at the analysisBitcoin maximalists were quick to respond to the Zhavoronkov’s thread.Network engineer Melik Manukyan, a prominent voice in the space, argued that the thread has a massive oversight: BTC’s potential for growth.He noted that assuming Bitcoin trades above $100,000 in the coming years as top analysts expect, a 33 percent dominance BTC would imply an aggregate altcoin market capitalization of at least ~$3.6 trillion.People try to tell me #Bitcoin dominance will go back to 33%. Let's run some numbers.Let's assume BTCUSD hits 100k post 3rd halving.This would mean the total value of outstanding Bitcoin is worth ~1.8T USD giving shitcoins a total value of ~3.65T USD.lol— Melik Manukyan (Buy Bitcoin) (@melikmanukyan) September 16, 2019$3.6 trillion is equivalent to around 20 percent of the U.S.’ expected GDP this year, and about 35 times the current value of all altcoins in circulation. This sum is also equivalent to the market capitalizations of the stocks of Apple, Microsoft, Walmart, and Netflix — entrenched companies that have been around for decades.The assumption here, of course, is that BTC will appreciate parabolically, but Manukyan’s argument is that it would be irrational to expect altcoins will keep pace with the market leader.Others debunked the content of the thread itself.Dan Held, part of the business development team at Kraken and formerly of Blockchain, quipped that the thread’s first chart, in which Zhavoronkov seemingly suggested that halvings result in drops in Bitcoin dominance, “imply causation.”And Xsquared Ventures partner Brad Mills argued that Bitcoin dominance is a poor metric to track the performance of BTC vs. altcoins by, making Zhavoronkov’s argument “based on a foundation of sand.”Mills cited an article he wrote on the matter, in which he conveyed that dominance metrics glosses over a number of key issues with altcoins, low liquidity due to centralization of coins, non-existent market depth (an altcoin may have a $100 million market cap but only $100,000 in buy orders, for instance), and “terrible network security.”Not to mention, many altcoins have rapidly inflating supplies compared to Bitcoin.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Over the past 14 days, ADA has rallied from $0.053 to a local high of $0.094 — a difference of 77 percent.This rally has allowed it to retake its seat as the tenth-largest cryptocurrency, outpacing Tezos’s XTZ, Crypto.com Coin, and Stellar’s XLM.On-chain data shows that a group of investors were behind the price action.On-chain analytics show who’s behind the Cardano surgeAccording to analysis shared by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock on Jun. 5, behind the recent surge in the Cardano price “may have [been] fueled” by “large investors.”$7 billion worth of the cryptocurrency, which is more than 300 percent of its market capitalization, was transacted by large-size ADA holders on May 31 alone — 1,700 percent higher that of the day prior.The parabolic increase in the volume of ADA transactions came as there were relatively few crypto investors on social media platforms like Twitter interested in the asset, further confirming it was the “whales” that drove the surge upward.Source: SantimentWhile the volume of large transactions has subsided since the peak, they remain at historically high levels according to the data, which should be supportive of further upside in the Cardano price.Other on-chain indicators corroborate this sentiment.As reported by CryptoSlate, the “In/Out of the Money” indicator from IntoTheBlock showed that as of Jun. 5, there was little resistance until ADA rallies to $0.11.Data via IntoTheBlockWhat’s behind the move?Now that we know who is likely behind ADA’s recent strength, it’s fitting we now look at the “what” of the move.As covered extensively by this outlet, the rally began around the time of the start of the launch of the testnet for Shelly, which is like Ethereum 2.0 but for Cardano, if you catch my drift. That’s to say, Shelly is the next era for the smart contract blockchain, which has been underperforming its competitors like Ethereum in terms of adoption.According to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, the blockchain is now at a point (or at least getting to a point) where it can process 1,000 transactions per second, basically eclipsing any other leading blockchain currently in use.Another blockchain data firm, Santiment, spoke about the development of the blockchain in a recent analysis:“ADA continues to show signs of strength in the market, and there are some emerging decoupling indications.

In the latest Shelley testnet development update, Cardano’s head of delivery Christopher Greenwood commented on the progress made so far and shared some of the plans the company has set in the weeks that lie ahead.According to Greenwood, the pioneers that have been testing Shelley have been overwhelmingly satisfied with the experience. There are currently over 50 pioneers, which include some of the stake pool operators from the Incentivized Testnet (ITN), which have set up 81 stake pools that have so far run successfully.The pioneers have gone through all of the exercises in the testnet, which include delegating, changing pool parameters, and transaction submitting, with most saying that the only bugs they encountered were “cosmetic.”All of this means that the testnet is ready to accept more stake pool operators. Greenwood said that extending the testnet to additional, public stake pool operators will happen next week, which is on track with previously laid out plans.What lies ahead for CardanoShelly rollout plan (dates). Source: Cardano.orgAt the end of this week or at the beginning of next week, there will be a “wrap up” of the pioneer testnet, where the Cardano team and stake pool operators will discuss on how to move the testnet to the next level.The wrap-up, according to Greenwood, will be followed by other major developments the team has scheduled for this month.The Adrestia API integration has been progressing really well, he said in the product update video, adding that it will be released by the end of the month.

56,CryptoSlate,"ICON, South Korea’s biggest crypto project, enables cross-chain interoperability",Shaurya Malwa,1590907800.0,"South Korea’s ICON, regarded by some as the country’s biggest cryptocurrency project, launched a significant update for its protocol earlier this week.The development marks an important step towards the project’s “hyperconnect the world” catchphrase.Interoperability benefitsAs detailed in a blog post, the Blockchain Transmission Protocol (BTP) enables interoperability between different blockchains, helping inter-project value transfers, service providing, and data exchange.BTP 1.0 is finally here! Check out the interoperability demo video on our youtube page and the blog post below! This is a HUGE milestone for the #ICONProject and we're excited to see where this technology can take us!https://t.co/9XWEYSxj3c— ICON (@helloiconworld) May 28, 2020BTP addresses a crucial junction in the future of global cryptocurrencies — that of enabling cross-chain interaction with one another instead of relying on thousands of individual, fragmented blockchain interfaces. The update makes the former possible, including connecting both public and private blockchains working on different consensus algorithms.Cross-chain data verification, important in a possible future with different blockchain services dominant in respective regions, is made possible via BTP. Other more ambitious ideas, such as decentralized identity and creation of DAOs using data from various blockchains as input, are also addressed.Token transfer across different blockchain apps is regarded as a major development. The blog noted:“BTP facilitates such transfer directly through smart contracts, from one chain to another without using a central trading platform, at the protocol level.”Achieving HyperconnectivityAn example of a BTP-run protocol is Broof, an application native to ICON that allows for issuance and storage of verified certificates on the blockchain. BTP, in this regard, helps to enable automation on a private chain, with the issuance tied with a Broof side-chain.(Source: ICON blog)Meanwhile, to fully utilize BTP features, the “sender” blockchain must have block “finality” and the participating blockchains must support smart contract capability. As irreversible results are transmitted to the recipient (blockchain), message data is verified via a smart contract.However, blockchain services that do not support smart contracts can participate in the BTP only as a sender, not as a recipient.While single implementations of BTP connect two blockchain networks, one could use other implementations to connect with more blockchains; creating a huge, “hyperconnected” network in the end.The BTP 0.5 Proof of Concept is now available on the ICON Github Page. BTP 1.0 is currently pending review before final acceptance.Posted In: Korea, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...  “Concerned” by Chinese influence, ICON founder reveals South Korea is mulling a $400 million blockchain fundSouth Korea’s fascination with blockchain and cryptocurrency seemingly grows stronger each day.   2 min read →   ICON (ICX) Partners with LINE to Build Blockchain ServicesICON (ICX) has announced a new partnership with LINE Corporation, the Japanese-based app development company best known for its LINE social media platform.   2 min read →   ICON to give away 3 million ICX tokens as part of upcoming node holder electionsThe ICON Foundation has announced it will be giving away 3 million ICX tokens to participants in its upcoming election.   2 min read → "
57,CryptoSlate,Facebook’s digital currency project rebrands to Novi; WhatsApp and fiat-pegged token capabilities remain,Shaurya Malwa,1590556020.0,"Calibra is no more.Just the name, though. Facebook’s ambitious digital currency project underwent a major rebranding on May 26, including a change in name, logo, design, and the addition of some new features.The “new way”As per an official Facebook announcement, Calibra is now Novi, an upcoming digital currency wallet used to access FB’s Libra protocol. The word derives from Latin words “via” and “novus,” which equate to “new way.” The parent company has also been renamed to Novi Financial instead of the earlier.David Marcus, head of Facebook’s digital currency division, noted a portion of Calibra’s old logo — a wave — was included in Novi’s logo as a nod to its predecessor. He also linked to a video of the new brand in the post.Calibra’s logo raised some controversy at its time, with critics noting its similarities to neo-bank Current.The rebrand is a part of a series of changes that Facebook intends to bring to its Libra project. Thus far, the company has faced intense regulatory scrutiny and lost several founding members, such as Mastercard and Visa. However, Libra has since bounced back, it’s gotten in new members, is better conforming with regulatory requirements, and is avoiding making any controversial statements in the regard.In 2019, Facebook said a Libra token would be backed by a collection of fiat currencies issued by central banks, creating a stablecoin for cross-border transfers and transactions of sorts.Now, the company is exploring multiple tokens pegged to various currencies as part of the broader Libra ecosystem. Novi’s website notes this includes currencies like the U.S. dollar, Euro, and the British pound. However, the mentions remain examples, instead of a definitive announcement.No launch dateDespite the rebrand, Facebook notes all other capabilities remain similar to Calibra’s mission. The firm wants users to send money “as easy as sending a message,” and plans to integrate the Novi wallet with WhatsApp and Messenger, both Facebook-owned messaging brands.Users will need a government-issued ID to sign up for the service, but Libra promises no-hidden-fee transfers and a 24/7 chat-based support.Meanwhile, no launch date for Novi or Libra has been announced, despite the rebrand. Any online promotions of the project, as CryptoSlate noted previously, are internet scams and should not be believed.Marcus tweeted an “early version” of Novi will be launched when the Libra network is available:We can’t wait to start rolling out the Novi wallet as soon as Libra mainnet goes live.

59,CryptoSlate,There are now 4x more addresses holding Ethereum than during the 2018 highs,Priyeshu Garg,1590372000.0,"There are now over 40 million addresses on the Ethereum network with a non-zero balance. According to cryptocurrency analytics company Glassnode, this represents an increase of 350 percent from the number of addresses during ETH’s ATH in early 2018.Comparing the number of addresses on Bitcoin and EthereumEthereum has long been in Bitcoin’s shadow, often being compared as the lesser of two cryptocurrencies due to its lower price and thus, a lower market cap. However, despite many saying comparing the two is very much like comparing apples to oranges due to the different nature of their networks, the entire market tends to look at both Bitcoin and Ethereum through the same lens.In that context, one of the fairest ways to compare the two networks’ adoption is through the number of users. As pinpointing just how many users are on a certain network is almost impossible, many use the number of active addresses or the number of addresses with a balance as the main indicators of how much a network is being utilized.According to data from cryptocurrency analytics company Glassnode, there has been a steady rise in the number of active addresses on Bitcoin this year—there have been more than 922,000 active addresses on the network on May 21.Graph showing the number of active addresses on Bitcoin in 2020.

60,CryptoSlate,"Despite ongoing rally, OmiseGo would need to rally over 1,400% to reclaim highs",Cole Petersen,1590318000.0,"OmiseGo – a relatively small crypto with a market cap of $261 million – has been caught within the throes of a parabolic uptrend over the past several days.This uptrend has allowed it to post some massive gains emblematic of those seen during 2017’s “altseason” – in turn drumming up significant interest amongst investors.Despite the magnitude of its recent uptrend, 94 percent of the cryptocurrency’s investors are still underwater in their positions.This statistic highlights just how far-reaching its multi-year decline has been, and also casts a shadow over the possibility that many altcoins will ever be able to revisit their previously established all-time highs.OmiseGo Rallies Over 200% from May LowsOmiseGo has been going parabolic, posting a massive climb from its multi-week lows.Earlier this month, the cryptocurrency was trading at lows of $0.65 – around the point at which it had been trading at throughout the past couple of months.On May 13th, it began gaining some immense momentum as it rallied to highs of over $1.00. This was just the start of what was to come next.Over the following week, OmiseGo rallied all the way to highs of over $2.00. At this point, buyers began losing their momentum and it has since declined slightly.This rally came about due to news of it being listed on popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.At the time of writing, OmiseGo is trading down marginally at its current price of $1.86.Investors took notice of this price action, and it appears to have sparked a buying frenzy – a trend highlighted while looking towards data from the research platform Santiment.“OMG is currently the number one trending keyword in terms of its frequency of social mentions vs. its expected average.

That’s a lot of bagholders from 2017.”This isn’t unique to OmiseGo, as most major altcoins that pumped hard in 2017 are still trading down 90 percent or more from their highs.

62,CryptoSlate,MakerDAO founder: Ethereum is a vacuum that will suck in almost “all value” in crypto,Nick Chong,1590141600.0,"This week, millions of dollars worth of Wrapped Bitcoin — the leading representation of BTC on the Ethereum blockchain — were deposited into decentralized stablecoin protocol MakerDAO to generate $4 million worth of the DAI stablecoin.According to MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen, this sole transaction is extremely bullish for Ethereum’s long-term value proposition, not just the protocol he helped to create.The importance of the 4 million DAI mintThe MakerDAO founder — one of the forefathers of the decentralized finance movement — argued that the mint of four million DAI shows the massive total addressable market that DeFi — and Ethereum by extension — has.“4 million Dai was just minted with WBTC in a single transaction. This really showcases the latent demand for non-ETH assets, and it’s the beginning of a broader trend of DeFi acting as an economic vacuum that will eventually attract almost all value to the Ethereum blockchain,” Christensen wrote in a comment that went crypto-viral among ETH supporters.4 million Dai was just minted with WBTC in a single transaction. This really showcases the latent demand for non-ETH assets, and it's the beginning of a broader trend of DeFi acting as an economic vacuum that will eventually attract almost all value to the Ethereum blockchain.— Rune Christensen (@RuneKek) May 20, 2020This is a similar assertion to one made by Andrew Keys, managing partner of Digital Asset Risk Management Advisors.Keys wrote in a ConsenSys blog post published at the start of this year that Ethereum has a “market opportunity estimated at well over $80 trillion” because the blockchain basically has “infinite use cases.” The investor, formerly an executive at ConsenSys, added:“We will be able to trustlesstly and digitally represent fiat, gold, software licenses, equity, debt, derivatives, loyalty points, reputation ratings, and much much more that we can’t even conceive of yet.”Dependent on ETH 2.0Although Christensen is convinced Ethereum will capture billions (maybe trillions) of dollars worth of economic value over time, as it stands, the blockchain will have trouble doing that.As noted by the analyst “Ceteris Paribus” on May 15, the cost to send Ethereum has effectively quadrupled since the end of April, rising to 41 Gwei as of the time of his post from the 10 Gwei baseline where the metric normally sits. This equates to around $0.20 to send ETH from address to address. (According to ETHGasStation, fees remain around the levels indicated in Paribus’ post.)Gas prices on Ethereum have been skyrocketing over the past month.

Instead, the primary function of the cryptocurrency is to interact with smart contracts, meaning high fees can make certain decentralized applications basically unusable, say, if you’re spending $1.00 on a $5.00 function.Hence why the ETH 2.0 upgrade is so important.For those unaware, Ethereum 2.0 is basically an overhaul of the blockchain that will implement technologies like Proof of Stake, sharding, and more to exponentially increase the speed, transaction throughput, and decentralization of the network.While the jury is still out on how exactly this upgrade will help Ethereum’s usability, it’s slated to remove at least two of the many crucial barriers preventing mainstream adoption: high fees and low transaction throughput.It’s begunEthereum may have a large reliance on the success of 2.0, though that’s not to say that the blockchain has not captured vast amounts of value as it stands.Already, the blockchain hosts over $7 billion worth of stablecoins, namely USDT. Furthermore, Reddit has begun to work with Ethereum technology while Visa has purportedly hinted at using the blockchain to digitize certain fiat currencies.That’s the thing, compared to other smart contract-focused blockchains, ETH is winning hands down.As reported by CryptoSlate, Placeholder Capital partner Chris Burniske noted that Ethereum is “orders of magnitudes ahead of any of its competitors in terms of people willing to pay for its utility.”He illustrated this point with the chart below from Dec. 2019, which shows the aggregate mining fees paid by Ethereum against Tezos, Waves, and Lisk.Mining Fees Paid Ethereum vs. Tezos, Waves & Lisk Combined (via Chris Burniske)Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, DeFi     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

63,CryptoSlate,IOHK launches new Cardano (ADA) blockchain explorer based on Byron reboot,Priyeshu Garg,1590037200.0,"The new Cardano Explorer based on the updated Byron reboot infrastructure has just been launched. IOHK said that the new explorer is a significant step up from the original and is among the final steps that will lead to the Shelley mainnet.Users can now look at Cardano through a completely re-engineered blockchain explorerAfter a successful week of the pioneer Shelley testnet, IOHK announced that it has officially begun deploying its new Cardano Explorer. The version 1.0.0 of the explorer is a completely re-engineered application—it’s based on the latest Byron reboot infrastructure that is set to better support Shelley once it launches.In a Twitter announcement, IOHK said that the new Cardano Explorer “offers a significant step up” from the original one that was released back in 2017 during the Cardano mainnet launch.Screengrab showing the home page of the Cardano Explorer. (Source: Twitter)Aside from bringing about new functionality both to the company and to Cardano users, the new explorer will be “foundational” for a host of future features that are set to be released with the Shelley mainnet. IOHK said that the launch of the more reliable and usable explorer is a big deal for the ecosystem as the company takes the final steps towards Shelley.More major news for IOHK and CardanoAfter announcing the launch of the new and improved blockchain explorer, IOHK went public with another set of good news. Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, confirmed that the company will be joining both the Hyperledger Project and W3C. Hoskinson said that the company was in the process of joining both Hyperledger and W3C earlier this week in a YouTube AMA.During the same AMA, Hoskinson said that he will recommend that the Cardano Foundation, a non-profit entity tasked with running the Cardano blockchain, also joins W3C as it represents an important driving force behind the entire ecosystem.Founded by the Linux Foundation, Hyperledger is an umbrella organization encompassing numerous blockchain protocols focused on servicing enterprises, while the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is a global community of companies, individuals, and governments working on developing and maintaining global Web standards.Hoskinson explained that as a member of Hyperledger, IOHK will focus on creating an enterprise version of Cardano. The time the company spends in the organization will be invaluable to them, as IOHK’s mandate for running the Cardano blockchain is set to expire this year.If the plan they have for the future of Cardano is approved by the community, IOHK’s contract will be renewed for another five years.Disclosure: The author is a Cardano Ambassador.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

65,CryptoSlate,"Charles Hoskinson discusses Shelley, trolls, and a 1000 tx/s future for Cardano",Priyeshu Garg,1589961600.0,"While the first wave of pioneers is testing Shelley, Hoskinson took to YouTube to answer community questions, touching on topics such as incessant trolls, roadmap deadlines, and handling a future Cardano that could process thousands of transactions every second.Putting an exclamation point at the launch of ShelleyThe first select group of participants has been using the Shelley testnet for well over a week now, and they have just begun to get the hang of it in the past few days. Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, took to YouTube to share this and a slew of other updates about Cardano as more progress is constantly being made in its development.In a two-hour AMA session, Hoskinson answered questions from the Cardano community and addressed some of the most frequently talked about issues in the space after sharing the progress of the pioneer testnet.The first week of the testnet was spent educating the pioneers about how Shelley would work, which included some stake pool operators and various other friends and associates of IOHK. This week, Hoskinson said, was all about making blocks and propagating blocks.Once the pioneers get the hang of the staking process that Shelley will bring, the testnet will gradually be opened to the general public. In June, IOHK will schedule a balance check after wiring in the Shelley wallet and Daedalus and focus on getting all of the Shelley users online throughout the month.If everything continues developing at the same pace as it did when the Incentivized Testnet was launched, we could see Shelley up and running as early as mid-June. Hoskinson spoke several times about how both the company and the stake pool operators were incredibly satisfied with what they’ve seen from Shelley, a feat that is clearly visible in Cardano’s numbers.He said:“There has never been, in the history of cryptocurrency, a testnet as successful as the Incentivized Testnet.”Hoskinson was visibly proud of the 19,000 validating nodes and over 1,200 stake pool operators that have participated in the ITN so far.The weeks of effort IOHK has put into Shelley will culminate at the end of the month, when the company is set to host a virtual summit. Last week, Hoskinson said that a contract with the software company hosting the summit has been signed and between 5 and 6 workflows are already being developed.While more concrete announcements will have to wait until the end of the month, Hoskinson did say that Plutus will be a major topic on the summit as it’s set to receive a “big update.” When it comes to the summit’s “very secret guest” Hoskinson mentioned last week, he still didn’t disclose who it might be. Some speculated that it would be Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter and CEO of Square.Hoskinson denied that either one of the two would attend the summit, telling viewers only that it would be someone whose work was essential for the crypto industry to exist.Shelley bringing a wind of change to the crypto industryHoskinson also addressed some controversies surrounding Cardano and IOHK, saying that the incessant trolling the project has been faced with was no longer meaningful to the company.“It’s getting almost comical for us,” he said about the trolling surrounding the launch of Shelley.While constructive criticism is something Hoskinson always claimed was welcome, the most recent wave of negative comments about Cardano crossed the line from criticism to outright hate. The animosity a certain part of the crypto industry feels towards Cardano was seen when the Wikipedia article describing the project was suddenly taken down due to the “novelty” of the project and a lack of verified sources.Hoskinson said that the Cardano community was working on creating a post that meets the Wikipedia guidelines, but said that the editors of the platforms were not being reasonable. Firstly, it was reportedly stated that Forbes and Bloomberg articles couldn’t be used as a “legitimate source” for content about Cardano. Secondly, much less important projects had their own extensive pages, which Hoskinson found absurd and “kafkaesque.”He used the example of Legends of Valour, a 1992 RPG game he purchased earlier this month, which has its own Wikipedia page backed with equally legitimate sources as Forbes and Bloomberg were. Unlike the game, which has “less than five people playing it” at any given time, Cardano is a $1.3 billion market cap project used by hundreds of thousands of people and backed with over 60 peer-reviewed research papers. It, however, doesn’t have its own Wikipedia page.Nonetheless, Hoskinson believes that as the Shelley mainnet is getting closer, so is the effect the Cardano had on the crypto industry becoming more evident. Despite not being profitable for the first few years, with most of the costs being covered out of his own pocket, Hoskinson said that “pound for pound and dollar for dollar” more code has been delivered to Cardano than to any other project.Even Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency which Hoskinson helped found, has begun taking formal methods seriously because of Cardano’s impact. However, Hoskinson doesn’t see Ethereum as Cardano’s competitor. When asked whether Ethereum or Algorand would be a bigger competitor to Cardano in the future, Hoskinson said that it would be neither of them. What Cardano is going to compete with, he explained, is the digital dollar that might be launched by the U.S. Federal Reserve.“And we’re gonna win that one.”All of this means that there is a high probability that IOHK will be able to meet every deadline it has set for this year. Hoskinson addressed the Cardano roadmap when asked by viewers about deadlines, saying that everything necessary that needed to be done on Basho, the era of Cardano that will bring about scaling, has already been done. The scalability approach has been solved and the stake pool model has been leveraged, Hoskinson said, adding that all that is left to do for Cardano’s upcoming phases are small-scale and technical.Addressing the problem of scalabilityWhile scalability has always been one of Cardano’s main value propositions, the upcoming Shelley mainnet now means that it’s a problem that needs to be dealt with. Viewers were interested to know how IOHK planned on solving the problem of data storage of a blockchain with the ability to process 1000 transactions per second.Hoskinson said that both he and the company have given the topic a lot of thought. This, he said, is one of the fundamental failings of Bitcoin—becoming too large to be a replicated artifact. Once the blockchain gets filled with terabytes of data, it loses one of its most important abilities called inclusive accountability. This allows everybody participating in the blockchain to verify the information to the same level of truthfulness, and gets lost once the data set becomes too large for every user to hold it.To mitigate this issue, Cardano needs to solve three separate sets of problems, the first one being treating the resources of the blockchain as a precious commodity while allowing block size to grow slowly over time. IOHK solved this by taking operations and data with a low economic priority such as microtransactions and pushing them into level 2 solutions. Keeping the second layer private, censorship-resistant, and open to participation is something he believes Hydra has already accomplished.Secondly, fundamentally different cryptographic primitives need to be used to protect the data on the blockchain. The best way to do that, he explained, is by using recursive snarks.And finally, the blockchain needs to move from a replicated to a distributed decentralized system. That way, everyone that uses the blockchain will only have a shard of data and not have to store and hold the entire blockchain.Most of these problems, if not already solved, are currently being worked on at IOHK. However, Hoskinson said that there was a somewhat controversial topic in the world of scalability that he hopes he could solve in the next five years—economic garbage collection.

66,CryptoSlate,An Ethereum DeFi token surged 400% in hours — and an analyst thinks 4chan is behind it,Nick Chong,1589873760.0,"While the price action of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top cryptocurrencies are predicated on underlying narratives and technical trends, low-cap altcoins rise and fall for the weirdest reasons.This much was made clear on May 17 and 18, when a small Ethereum-based token rallied by over 400 percent due to one unexpected market catalyst: 4chan.Ethereum token OCDAI pumps 400% in hours due to 4chan: analystOn May 17, the price of Opyn’s CDAI Insurance token — which allows users of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Compound to obtain insurance on their deposits  — exploded higher, rallying from $0.002 to a high of $0.01 within the span of a day.Normally, OCDAI rallying means that users are fearful of an imminent collapse of Compound or a liquidation event in DeFi, which would see depositors lose all or a portion of their cryptocurrency.So normally, this wouldn’t have made the news — little-known cryptocurrencies rally all the time, after all.But according to Daryl Lau, a research analyst at crypto data site CoinGecko, the reason why the altcoin rallied so far and so fast is that “4chan discovered it and decided it was a low cap DeFi coin without even reading what the token is for.”He cited a thread from 4chan, the storied anonymous online forum, which contained comments like:“I think this is the earliest I have ever gotten in on something. I have a good feeling about this” and “I would buy OCDAI because of the low supply and real product with a magnificent whitepaper.”With the cryptocurrency having low liquidity due to OCDAI’s market capitalization being well under $20,000, according to Etherscan, a few buyers from 4chan seemingly sent the altcoin skyrocketing.The need for insurance in DeFiAlthough the pump of the Ethereum token was clearly unnatural, there is a valid need for insurance in the decentralized finance ecosystem, making Opyn and other projects like it valuable in this volatile industry.As reported by CryptoSlate in April, users of decentralized lending protocol Lendf.me lost approximately $25 million worth of Ethereum, Tether’s USDT, and other cryptocurrencies to a hack.Just a month earlier, a series of unfortunate events saw multiple users of DeFi’s posterchild, MakerDAO, lose over 100 percent of their funds in a liquidation event when they only should have lost approximately 20 percent. For some victims, the funds were a large portion of their savings.While Lendf.me has since recovered the funds and MakerDAO has since restabilized, these scenarios highlight the need for insurance mechanisms that allow users to trade portions of their capital for security.After all, if DeFi truly wants to one-up Wall Street, how will it do so without insurance?Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, DeFi     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

68,CryptoSlate,Analyst: here’s how far Bitcoin’s dominance needs to drop before altcoins can rally,Cole Petersen,1589612400.0,"Bitcoin’s recent uptrend has come about largely at the expense of smaller digital assets, as many altcoins have posted a severe underperformance of BTC as investors grow increasingly keen on finding assets that can perform well given the current global economic situation.Some major cryptocurrencies are even trading at price levels not seen since 2014 while looking towards their BTC trading pairs.This has in turn led Bitcoin’s dominance over the crypto market to rise sharply in recent times, and one analyst is now noting that it may have to decline by 8 percent in order for altcoins to begin garnering upwards momentum.Altcoins severely underperform Bitcoin as traders flock to liquidityThe ongoing economic crises seen across the globe has led investors within all markets to flock towards quality and liquidity.In the case of the crypto markets, this has led to an exodus away from altcoins and towards Bitcoin.Many major cryptocurrencies – including Ethereum and XRP – have gravely underperformed the benchmark digital asset throughout the past several weeks.This trend is elucidated while looking towards Bitcoin’s dominance over the market, which currently sits at 67.4 percent. This marks a notable climb from mid-February lows of just under 60 percent that came about at the peak of the market.Ever since then, this trend has firmly reversed, and Bitcoin now has the highest dominance over the crypto market seen since 2019.Data via CoinMarketCapOne pseudonymous trader on Twitter named “Pentoshi” spoke about the poor performance altcoins have seen against BTC in recent times, noting that many are trading at levels not seen since 2014.“ETH heading for levels not seen since 2016. LTC trading below 2014-2016 prices. XRP heading for levels from 2014, 2016, and 2017. The alt market looks like it could capitulate soon.”Here’s how low BTC’s dominance needs to decline for altcoins to rallyJosh Rager – another well-respected cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter – explained that he believes Bitcoin’s dominance needs to decline towards 60 percent before altcoins can rally.“BTC dominance has remained between 62% to 72% since June 2019. Before the next altcoin rally, would like to see a sharp move back down to low 60%. But if Bitcoin can get a close above $10,500 – would likely cause money to flow into BTC leading to increase in dominance.”Image Courtesy of Josh RagerWhether or not investors continue treating Bitcoin as a safe haven asset could also play a role in where its dominance over the market trends, as this could perpetuate the ongoing exodus away from altcoins.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

69,CryptoSlate,Altcoins like Ethereum may soon benefit from institutions rushing to buy Bitcoin,Nick Chong,1589602320.0,"As evidenced by various interviews, Twitter comments, and data sets, institutions have finally started to enter the cryptocurrency market en-masse. Wall Street’s focus thus far has been Bitcoin.But an analyst expects institutional players to expand their horizons to include top altcoins in the future, citing data from exchange Coinbase regarding the behavior of investors.Institutions could leap to altcoins after dabbling in BitcoinIn a blog post published on May 13, leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase indicated that while Bitcoin is by far the most popular digital asset on the platform, it acts as a sort of “gateway drug” to altcoins.Their data found that out of all the accounts registered in 2019-2020, “with at least 5 purchases on Coinbase.com,” a mere 24 percent stick exclusively with investing in Bitcoin, while the rest “eventually buy other assets” — or altcoins.Chart from Coinbase indicating the propensity of the exchange’s users to buy altcoins after buying Bitcoin.According to Messari’s Ryan Watkins, the propensity that Coinbase users have to migrate to altcoins over time rather than sticking with Bitcoin might be reflected in institutions “over time”:“Bitcoin is by far the leading cryptoasset and perhaps the most important, but Coinbase customer data shows that new users generally begin to look for alternative assets and use cases. […] I imagine institutions will behave similarly over time.”Ethereum seems to be the most obvious bet after Bitcoin, especially since it just got its first U.S.-regulated futures contract and since the project is being supported by companies like Reddit, IBM, and more.Bitcoin remains the best crypto betWhile there are already some institutions delving into altcoins, as evidenced by Grayscale’s Q1 2020 investment report that signaled enormous hedge fund support for Ethereum, institutional players themselves have said that Bitcoin is the best bet when it comes to cryptocurrencies.After all, aside from Ethereum and Tether’s USDT, it is the only liquid cryptocurrency, especially when you’re talking about institutional players that trade millions.Paul Tudor Jones, a legendary macro hedge fund manager worth over $5 billion, released a note on Bitcoin last week titled “The Great Monetary Inflation.”While he did not directly bash altcoins, he made it clear that the reason why he chose Bitcoin as an alternative investment over, say, Ethereum is that the original cryptocurrency has the characteristic of “quintessential” scarcity that is hard to replicate in other assets — let alone other cryptocurrencies.This thought process has been echoed by investors like Raoul Pal — a former Goldman Sachs executive and the current chief executive of Real Vision.The Wall Street veteran indicated in a number of interviews that if you truly believe cryptocurrency is the future, Bitcoin is automatically the most reliable bet, with Pal branding BTC the “call option” on a decentralized and digital economy.Posted In: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

70,CryptoSlate,Here’s why the next two weeks are pivotal for the Cardano Shelley pioneer testnet,Priyeshu Garg,1589518800.0,"Launched earlier this week, the Cardano’s pioneer Shelley testnet gathered a select group of pool operators that have been testing the Cardano network. According to Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, the testnet has so far been tremendously successful, providing important insights to IOHK. However, the next two weeks will be pivotal for its development, as the company is set to deal both with new problems and scheduled optimization.Friends and family Shelley testnet a huge successThe Shelley friends and family testnet was one of the biggest milestones both for Cardano as a network and IOHK as the company that created it. Launched on Monday, May 11, the testnet was supposed to gather 20-something stake pool operators that are close to IOHK and could, in theory, offer the company a fresh look at how the Shelley mainnet would look like.As five days have already passed since operators, called “pioneers,” began testing Shelley, Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, took to YouTube to offer a brief update on how the testing was going.“From a QA perspective, it has been tremendously successful.”Stake pool operators have been diligently working their way through the exercises created by IOHK. According to Hoskinson, these exercises offer a twofold benefit—firstly, they teach operators how to navigate the network and get the most out of it. Secondly, they act as valuable checkpoints for IOHK, allowing the company to have a better understanding of how far each of the stake pool operators have come.Keeping an eye on pioneers and sharing future plansHoskinson said that his team has a checklist of all of the 19 stake pool operators where it was following how far they’ve all gone through the given exercises. These include everything from setting up stake pools to more complex pledging and delegation.The statistics are so far looking good, he said, despite there being things regarding usability that needed to be improved.Hoskinson also stressed the importance of the pioneers that have been testing Shelley—they, not IOHK, will be ones that get more people onboard the network. They have all been instructed to create videos detailing their experience with Shelley and use them as a chance to introduce themselves to the community. The number of pioneers also grew from 19 to 32 since Monday, as they have all been instructed to invite two more people to join the network.“This is exactly how you launch a network,” Hoskinson said. Bringing a cohort of highly experienced and talented people that keep both you and your work in check while providing valuable feedback and helping you grow, he explained.When it comes to the next few weeks, IOHK has a lot in store. Hoskinson said that the Shelley node will be updated on May 21, as the team is on a two-week release schedule. Things are already queued up for the May 21 release, which will contain important updates such as integration of the Haskell wallet backend. The following node update, scheduled for June 4, will be of much less priority.Cardano’s virtual summit is also set to take place at the end of the month, with Hoskinson saying that a contract with the provider has already been signed. There are already 5-6 workstreams set up, and the summit is set to feature a special guest whose identity will be revealed once the website for the summit is launched.Disclosure: The author is a Cardano Ambassador.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

71,CryptoSlate,Pledging is set to keep Cardano (ADA) safe and decentralised; here’s how it works,Priyeshu Garg,1589504400.0,"With Shelley mainnet closer than ever, IOHK’s education director explained how the network will stay protected while maintaining high efficiency—pledging. Pledging is set to provide a mechanism that encourages a healthy commercial ecosystem on Cardano, as it would request the highest pledge possible from stake pool operators while keeping smaller stake pools competitive.Why pledging is essential for the Cardano networkWhat makes Cardano a competitive proof-of-stake network is its stake delegation and reward mechanisms. With the Shelley mainnet now closer than ever, IOHK is dedicating a lot of resources into educating the community about how the network will work.The company’s education director Lars Brünjes published a blog post detailing how the network will retain its safety without sacrificing both efficiency and fairness to its stake pool operators.Cardano allows all pool operators to pledge some or all of their personal ADA stakes to their pool in order to make it more attractive, keeping small and medium pools competitive was of major concern to IOHK. As there is no maximum pledge, a pool operator with a lot of ADA could maximize their own rewards by saturating the pool with their own pledge and not attract delegation.This kind of behavior would be discouraged as by pledging more, pool operators can ask for higher margins and still attract delegators.Pool’s attractiveness would be determined by a combination of low operating costs, low margin, high performance, and high level of pledge.Despite its potential shortcomings, Brünjes explained, pledging serves as an important mechanism in Cardano’s proof-of-stake protocol. Not only does it ensure that a healthy commercial ecosystem thrives on Cardano, it is also the best way to protect the system against Sybil attacks.Cardano doesn’t want to trade securityA Sybil attack allows users with a little personal stake to create hundreds of pools with low margins and potentially gain control of the consensus and engage in double-spending. By making pools with higher pledges more attractive to stakers, these kinds of attacks can easily be prevented, Brünjes said.However, this forced Cardano to face a potentially detrimental tradeoff—it was important to set the influence of pledging as low as possible in order to keep smaller pools competitive, while also being able to guarantee security to its users.That’s why the parameter that determines the influence of pledging is yet to be set. It has, however, been designed to be flexible and adjustable over time. This is why the Shelley Haskell testnet will provide the ideal opportunity to tune this parameter and test which values work best.A calculator that will help pool operators work out how pledge amounts affect delegation and rewards is currently in the works and will help operators navigate the network more easily.Brünjes wrote in his blog post:“We believe in our scientific approach and are confident that our design will lead to a decentralized, stable, and secure system”Disclosure: The author is an upcoming Cardano Ambassador.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

72,CryptoSlate,21 committee members to control Neo’s governance in version 3,Priyeshu Garg,1589353380.0,"As Neo is anticipating the launch of its newest iteration—Neo3—its founder and CEO Da Hongfei explained what the latest upgrade will bring to the ecosystem. The biggest change to Neo, aside from integrating various tokenization services, will come in the form of a new governance system, where 21 committee members will be voted in by Neo token holders.Neo’s upcoming upgrade will keep it competitiveFrequently referred to as the “Chinese Ethereum,” Neo has been making major moves in 2019 that would increase its global footprint. After opening up a U.S. office and recruiting a former Microsoft executive to lead it, the company has been readying the Neo blockchain for the launch of version 3.0. Da Hongfei said:“As an upgrade, from Neo2 to Neo3, [it] will be the most important upgrade in Neo’s history.”Da addressed the upgrade during the CryptoAsia online summit, saying that Neo will be improving all of the major aspects of a public blockchain—adaptability, tokenization, and interoperability. Neo3 will use a new version of the BFT-style consensus—dBFT 2.0, upgrade its Virtual Machine, and update the entire architecture of the core blockchain.On top of the core protocol, Neo will have a digital identity system called NeoID, a distributed storage system called NeoFS, and a built-in Oracle.“Neo will be the first blockchain system to allow you to do that, to directly visit the internet.”However, the biggest change will come in the form of a new governance system and economic model, Da explained.Complex governance coming to Neo in version 3.0In its third version, Neo will adopt new governance and economic models that will be quite different from the ones users are used to with Neo2.John deVadoss, head of development at Neo told CryptoSlate :” Profound change is here at a global scale; we believe that the Smart Economy is here in and in a big way.’ – and ‘Neo’s architecture and consensus algorithms have been adopted by the likes of Libra et al. “According to Hongfei, the Neo blockchain will be run by 21 committee members who will be voted in by Neo token holders.  All of the committee members will be responsible for proposing parameter changes for the Neo blockchain. Those holding Neo in Neo3 will be given “a little amount” of GAS to incentivize activity. Active participation in the governance of Neo and voting will enable users to earn more GAS, he explained.Different amounts of newly generated GAS will be distributed to different roles in the blockchain—NEO holders will get 10 percent, voters will get 85 percent, while 5 percent will be allocated to the committee.The top 7 most voted members of the 21-strong committee will be the ones that run Neo’s consensus nodes. Those 7 nodes will then be responsible for generating new blocks by reaching consensus, block-by-block, by using dBFT 2.0.Illustration representing Neo’s upcoming governance model. (Source: Medium)Aside from governance, another major change coming to Neo3 are tokenization services. Da said that the Switcheo Network, a decentralized non-custodial exchange, will be connected to the Neo blockchain. Security token offering service provider Liquefy will also be integrating NeoID, enabling people who are doing STOs on their platform to use digital identity with Neo.Da didn’t reveal when Neo3 will be launched but said that it will run parallel to Neo2 “for a period of time,” when users will be able to convert or transfer assets and smart contracts from one version to the other.

73,CryptoSlate,Will fundamental strength stop Chainlink from breaking key macro growth curve?,Cole Petersen,1589266800.0,"Chainlink’s immense bullishness throughout 2019 and 2020 has coincided with the emergence of a prominent growth curve that has been guiding it higher.The reactions LINK posts to tests of this curve have been quite significant in the past, with it acting as a catalyst for some of its largest parabolic swings.It does appear that it is only a matter of time before this growth curve is broken, however, which could mean that the era of Chainlink being the firm market leader – in terms of performance – is quickly coming to an end.The crypto has shown signs of immense fundamental strength in the past, however, but a peak into the levels at which new LINK investors may be keen to sell their crypto at may spell trouble for its near-term trend.Chainlink risks invalidating macro uptrend as key growth curve runs out of roomAt the time of writing, Chainlink is trading down just over two percent at its current price of $3.62, marking a notable decline from daily highs of over $3.80.It is important to note that the decline was seen today simply marks an extension of the weakness that came about as a result of the cryptocurrency’s firm rejection at highs of $4.15 seen on May 9th.The subsequent decline following the sharp rally to these highs has led Chainlink down to the strong support that has been established within the mid-$3.00 region.It also appears that this support has coincided closely with the key growth curve that has been established throughout the past couple of years.One analyst named Pentoshi noted that although Chainlink is “looking tired” he doesn’t believe its rally is over yet. He does explain that a dip below this growth curve could mark a full invalidation of the uptrend seen throughout the past two years.“LINK: The most resilient crypto of the last 3 years regardless of market conditions this animal has powered on. It has formed higher lows for years, even in crypto wide bear market. A complete outlier. Has to hold the white line or this run ends imo. Looking tired but not done.”Chainlink Price (via Pentoshi)Will fundamental strength stop a decline beneath this curve?Although Chainlink has seen growing fundamental strength in terms of new wallet addresses, high activity on social media, and large numbers of contributions on its GitHub, all this may not be enough to thwart a massive selloff.Data from the blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock reveals that the number of wallets that acquired LINK in the upper-$3.00 region far outweigh those that acquired it in the lower-$3.00 region.In/Out of the Money Around Chainlink (via IntoTheBlock)This signals that Chainlink may face some heavy resistance at just below $4.00 that stops it from seeing a bullish response to its latest growth curve visit.

74,CryptoSlate,Charles Hoskinson: Cardano’s Pioneers will start testing Shelley Stakepool today,Priyeshu Garg,1589180400.0,"With the Shelley node running, the launch of Cardano’s proof-of-stake era has never been closer. The misinformed critics have been citing fictitious delays, however, Cardano is set to launch Pioneer’s program today in which limited pool operators will start testing Shelley.Cardano critics turn a blind eye to development progressWhile it’s been around for almost five years, it wasn’t until last year that Cardano began taking up significant space in crypto media. The launch of the Incentivized Testnet (ITN) for Shelley, the staking era of the blockchain, pushed it to the forefront of the industry where the solid mathematics and formal methods it was based on really made it stand out from the competition.And now, with the node for the Shelley mainnet up and running, true decentralization has never been closer. Last month, Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson took to YouTube to explain the mechanics of launching the Shelley mainnet, saying it will roll out in several phases to ensure that only a fully functioning network goes live.However, while Cardano supporters celebrated the major milestone, many critics were skeptical of the progress made by IOHK. Forums, Reddit threads, and Twitter timelines were all ripe with equal parts criticism and trolling, with people saying IOHK’s notorious launch delays meant that there was no way Shelley would see the light of day anytime in 2020.No way Shelley won’t launch in 2020, Hoskinson saysHoskinson’s answer to this was that Shelley shipping in 2020 is both a promise and an inevitable reality. In a short video, he addressed the rising skepticism about Shelley that has popped up on social media, saying that it was important to nip those rumors in the bud.IOHK currently has a Shelley node running, he explained. This week, a command-line interface (CLI) will be added that will connect it to the friends and family testnet—the first, invite-only testnet that will precede the open testnet.The friends and family testnet is set to launch next week and will feature about 20 stake pool operators from the ITN. These operators have stated that they want their names and contributions to the testnet to be known to the public, which is why IOHK will release their information once the testnet begins.This isn’t the first nor will it be the last time that IOHK will have to fight against skepticism and apprehension. The crypto industry as a whole has been plagued with distrust ever since its inception, the only difference being that in its early days, most of the critics were coming from outside the space.In an interview with CoinMarketCap, Hoskinson said that myths and misconceptions have always been a part of the crypto industry, with the only thing that has changed is the trends.“In 2011/2012, the perception of crypto — if people even knew about it, because the vast majority of people didn’t — was that it was basically an underground currency to buy drugs,” he said.Then, 2013 brought about a new type of criticism—that the industry was “a bunch of crypto-anarchists against the central bank.” In 2017 came the ICO boom and the belief that cryptocurrencies were a “magic money machine,” he explained.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

While he said it was his own passion project, and not affiliated with IOHK, Hoskinson will be looking into ways to integrate a blockchain-based distribution system into the game through workshops and studios in Central Africa.90s RPG game Legends of Valour is getting a new ownerLegends of Valour. Source: YoutubeIn the midst of the busiest period ever both for him personally and his company, IOHK, Charles Hoskinson embarked on a rather interesting passion project—buying and reviving his favorite childhood game.He is currently in the process of finishing up the acquisition of Legends of Valour, a role-playing game released in 1992. The game itself was revolutionary when released, as it was one of the first RPG games to use a 3D environment engine.Hoskinson said that this was his personal project, bought with his own money, and not affiliated with IOHK. However, what Hoskinson plans on doing with the game will be closely related to Cardano.Namely, Hoskinson said that the unfinished ending of Legends of Valour will be the first thing that gets redone—he said a team has already been created that will be tasked with disassembling the game’s compiled code and getting down to the source code. Once the team figures out what the unfinished ending was supposed to be, they will create an enhanced edition of the game.Keeping everything open-source and blockchain-basedThroughout the process, the game will be modernized to a point where it will be playable on a modern PC, Hoskinson said, adding that it might also be released in 4K. The enhanced edition will most likely be released as an open-source code, allowing everybody to play the game for free.After the enhanced edition is released to the public, Hoskinson plans on rewriting and remastering the entire game. As an avid player, he believes there is much to be improved in the game’s UI/UX. In line with the mission he embedded in IOHK, Hoskinson said that the remastering will be done in Central Africa. He said that Rwanda was an attractive place for a project like that, as the country wants to become the next Silicon Valley by incentivizing the development of the IT industry.Hoskinson said that he was keen on seeing if a game distribution system can be created by using a blockchain back-end. Cardano could, in theory, be used to issue non-fungible tokens which could serve as in-game assets and items, such as armor, rare coins, etc. Users that buy a game could also be given a did they can register and use as a decentralized regulator.

76,CryptoSlate,"Bitcoin’s boom against altcoins proves the rally to $9,000 is legitimate",Nick Chong,1588845600.0,"Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have experienced a massive surge over the past 10 days. After trading in the $7,000s for weeks on end, BTC finally saw a breakout to $9,500 just last week, since settling into a consolidation pattern a few percentage points shy of the high.Some have been skeptical about if the positive trends exhibited in this rally will hold.Yet one prominent trader says that the simple fact Bitcoin has recently strongly outpaced altcoins gives credence to the recent leg up.Bitcoin outperforms altcoins in the recent surgeAs CryptoSlate detailed extensively, cryptocurrencies like Tezos, Chainlink, and Cardano were all seeing strong gains against Bitcoin due to an influx of positive developments regarding their network fundamentals.It was a trend that caused Bitcoin dominance — the percentage of the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies that consists of BTC — to fall from 66 percent at the start of April to 63.4 percent just weeks later. It may be only a 2.6 percent move, but considering this is a market worth hundreds of billions.This trend changed last week, however, when Bitcoin surged 20 percent within 48 hours.As analyst “Light” pointed out, during BTC’s rally to and past the key $9,000 resistance level, there was a “marked decoupling between Bitcoin and altcoins in the last week as we move into the halving.”This was accentuated in the chart below, which shows that BTC (highlighted in BTC) easily outperformed large-cap altcoins since the end of April. This bifurcation has caused BTC dominance to snap back to 66 percent.Seeing a marked decoupling between Bitcoin and alts in the last week as we move into the halving.Bitcoin's relative outperformance as fiat pours into it and participants cycle out of alts and into BTC marks this latest leg up as more credible. pic.twitter.com/VaY9MVU9rc— light (@LightCrypto) May 4, 2020This is good for crypto’s trajectoryLight believes that BItcoin’s relative performance is a clear sign that this market has seen an influx of fiat buying activity, resulting in “market participants cycling out of alts and into BTC.”This is important as the analyst concluded by writing that the influx of fiat-to-BItcoin purchases makes the ongoing move that much “more credible.”Indeed, as this outlet reported previously, last week’s surge past $9,000 resulted in BitMEX’s open interest metric falling to new all-time lows of 50,000 BTC. Prior to March’s crash to $3,700, BitMEX’s open interest was closer to 100,000 BTC, according to Skew.com.Chart from Skew.comThis metric reaching an all-time low is significant because it suggests that the speculative contracts, the futures, “no longer dominate the price of Bitcoin,” Bitazu Capital partner Mohit Sorout explained to me in a recent interview.Instead, it was spot/fiat markets that were “leading this uptrend.”Sustainable rallies are built on consumers and institutions buying ‘physical’ Bitcoin, not participating in longing futures contracts. The leverage that comes alongside derivatives always has to unwind eventually while holders of BTC never need to sell, especially if they are already profitable in their investment.

The new payment messaging standard is set to replace SWIFT MT messages as the standard format for cross-border and high-value payments.Ripple becomes the first blockchain company to join new global payments standardRipple has been making huge strides in conquering the cross-border payments industry in the past couple of years. The latest step the company has made in becoming a staple payment provider has been joining the ISO 20022 Standards Body.In the official announcement, the company said that it has become the first member of the ISO 20022 Standards Body focused on distributed ledger technology (DLT). Ripple said that joining the standards body will enable the company to achieve the next step in global interoperability and meet the evolving needs of its customers.The ISO 20022 membership will allow customers to utilize RippleNet to access a network of global financial institutions, connect to one standardized API for all counterparty connections, and simplify implementation and reduce operational overhead.Over 300 financial institutions currently rely on Ripple’s global payments network, including MUFG, SCB, and Santander.Transforming the payments industry with ISO 20022The migration to ISO 20022, the new payment messaging standard, is set to have a profound effect on payments. According to Global Banking and Finance, the migration to the new standard will require significant efforts both from banks and their clients as it is set to replace SWIFT MT messages as the standard messaging format for the transfer of cross-border and high-value payments.Nobuo Ando, the representative director at SBI Remit, one of Ripple’s biggest customers, said that the company’s duty was to search for technological solutions to deliver remittance services to their customers.

80,CryptoSlate,How Cardano will be used to fight counterfeiting,Priyeshu Garg,1588583640.0,"The lab at the University of Wyoming has been working on an anti-counterfeiting solution based on the Cardano blockchain. Armed with $500,000 worth of ADA from IOHK, the lab is exploring how to create chips that are able to contain what is essentially tokenized proof-of-ownership of luxury goods ranging from watches to supercars.An anti-counterfeiting solution that utilizes Cardano is in the worksThe problem of counterfeiting isn’t something that the luxury goods industry is faced with, but it’s the industry that suffers the most when the authenticity of its products is put into question. The industry has historically struggled to solve this problem by introducing serial codes, holographic stickers, and invisible ink. These methods, however, haven’t stood the test of time and are easy to override.The U.S. university received $500,000 worth of ADA from IOHK back in February and is set to use the money to develop a blockchain-based anti-counterfeiting solution.According to Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, this is a project that’s well beyond the scope of 2020 and could take several years to fully implement. Nonetheless, if executed right, its possibilities are endless and it could bring about a full revolution in the luxury goods industry.Hoskinson took to YouTube to explain how the solution that’s being developed at the university will work, beginning with an overview of the current supply chain system in the industry.Every luxury good lives inside a supply chain that ultimately ends in retail and every stage of that supply chain, including the retail one, poses a threat to the item’s authenticity. Despite most luxury goods being fitted with a serial code, the process is done when the item is already well into the supply chain and is notoriously hard to control. The end-user often has no way to authenticate whether or not a serial code is actually real, making them essentially worthless.A solution that the University of Wyoming is currently working on will utilize both software and hardware in order to solve the problem. Hoskinson said that the lab is working on creating a chip that is capable of several cryptographic operations, such as the Intel SGX or the ARM TrustZone. The basic idea behind this is essentially creating a chip that makes extracting information from it very hard and then using it to store and use private keys.Related: Cardano’s-Parent IOHK donates $500,000 to the University of WyomingThese chips will be equipped with RFC, RFID, or a similar standard and be extremely cheap to make—Hoskinson estimates that a single chip would cost between 1 and 10 cents. A chip like this would be easy to implant into items such as luxury handbags, shoes, watches, etc.Solving the issue of authentication with hardwareAs Cardano will soon have a multi-asset standard, it will be easy to issue tokens on the platform. What the Wyoming lab plans on doing is tokenizing authenticity—issuing coins that represent the authenticity or ownership of a luxury good.Take, for example, a luxury Louis Vuitton handbag. During the production of the bag, a chip able to hold private keys will be inserted in it. Somewhere in the supply chain, an authenticator will be tasked with examining the bag in order to prove its authenticity. If the bag passes quality tests, the authenticator would then issue a transaction sending one of the authentication tokens on Cardano to the chip.Once the private key has been encumbered with that asset it can never be removed, as the private key itself can’t be moved. And as the private key is locked into the chip forever, so is the authentication token.Hoskinson went on to explain that while the chip itself will be passive, it will be able to perform several functions as a protocol of challenge-response would be added to it. For example, in order to validate the authenticity of a bag, the authenticator could simply tap or scan the chip with a mobile phone, which would verify if the chip has a legitimate token on it.The chip would be able to receive and process the request through NFC or RFID communication protocols and generate a signature that returns that query to the authenticator. The authenticator is then able to look at the Cardano blockchain and verify that the token exists, therefore verifying the authenticity of the bag.Hoskinson expects these chips to evolve and improve over time. He said that it will be possible to add all sorts of metadata to it so that in addition to storing the private key for a token, the chips also store the history of the item, where it was made, where it was sold, and ownership lists.And while this doesn’t completely abolish the possibility of counterfeiting, it makes it extremely inefficient.Hoskinson said that a counterfeiter could remove the chip from the authentic item and put it into a counterfeit one. However, this means that one handbag yields only a single counterfeit one. The 1:1 relation, while still essentially allowing counterfeiting, is a huge improvement from one real handbag being used to make thousands of counterfeits.If chips were made so that they could communicate with each other, or introduce several decoy chips, this would drastically reduce the already low possibility of counterfeiting.Programmable chips provide endless opportunitiesBy separating the authentication process from the manufacturer, better oversight of the supply chains would be achieved. Another major selling point of this solution is its lack of centralization—the authentication tokens would be the same for a wide variety of luxury goods companies, which means that the database containing them won’t be controlled by a single company.For example, the mobile app used to scan the chips and verify the authenticity of, say, a Louis Vuitton handbag, would be the same app used to verify handbags manufactured by Gucci, Chanel, Dior, etc. The same goes for luxury watches, jewelry, shoes, and even exotic and luxury cars.Related: Cardano shares details of its partnership with New Balance to solve authenticity on the blockchainWhile there’s still a long way to go before we see a working prototype, Hoskinson already sees their massive potential. He said that making the chips programmable would allow them to add more cryptographic protocols to it, and thus increase their functionality.For example, each luxury goods store would have its own master key that issues a transaction on the Cardano blockchain when an item is bought, adding metadata to the chip such as information on when, where, and by whom it was bought. This metadata would effectively serve both as a certificate of authenticity and proof of ownership.The sky’s the limit when it comes to these functionalities, Hoskinson said. Brands could create loyalty systems that tokenize the right to buy something—customers could tokenize their place in a waiting list for a luxury watch or an exotic car and sell it to other customers.“It monetizes the fact that you are a loyal customer to a firm.”As Hoskinson stated before, these ideas are neither new nor revolutionary. However, when combined with blockchain, a trusted hardware module, a mobile phone app, and advanced cryptography, they provide a robust and resilient solution that’s easy to implement. Such a solution would most likely be coupled with Prism, Cardano’s identity solution.An easy implementation process will allow such a solution to scale and easily reach millions of customers, which are the driving force behind the $280 billion industry.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

82,CryptoSlate,Venture capitalist: We’ve never seen a compelling reason to hold Bitcoin SV,Nick Chong,1588240800.0,"Years after their respective forks, both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV) have remained at the top of this nascent market, representing the fifth and sixth largest cryptocurrencies, respectively.It’s clear, then, that the market places some value in these Bitcoin forks.But a top investor in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space — the same investor that coined the now-ubiquitous term “crypto-assets” — has said that he sees no “compelling” reason to allocate capital to BSV.Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision unlikely to “store value over the long term”In response to a critique from a member of the Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision community that his firm doesn’t have exposure to the asset, Chris Burniske — partner at Placeholder Capital, a crypto-venture firm — said he has “never seen a reason” to hold BSV.He elaborated in a later tweet that Placeholder’s partners have not seen a “compelling reason” to believe that BSV will “store-value over the long term, or be a commonly used consumable [or] transformable asset.”Burniske added that the fundamental premise of BSV is flawed because he “also doesn’t see how you can claim it’s ‘Satoshi’s Vision’ when no one can reliably prove who, or what, Satoshi is.”Security concerns could threaten BSV’s valueBurniske didn’t fully elaborate on why he has such sentiment regarding the leading Bitcoin fork, but the common rhetoric is that the cryptocurrency simply isn’t secure in a world where new mining machines are flooding the market en-masse.Case in point: as reported by Crypto51.app — a website that tracks the cost of enacting a so-called “51% attack” on a blockchain to falsify or censor transactions — the cost to attack Bitcoin SV for one hour is a mere $8,237 as of the time of this article’s writing.For some context, the cost to attack the original Bitcoin network for the same period of time, the site estimates, would be $640,767 — approximately 7,700 percent higher. The cost to attack Ethereum for one hour is $110,000, a whole order of magnitude higher than what would need to be spent for BSV.This statistic is commonly cited by BTC maximalists trying to explain why investing in BSV or Bitcoin Cash is a risk, at least compared to other large-cap cryptocurrencies.What coins make sense then?Although Burniske and the team at Placeholder Capital have ruled out BSV as a crypto asset they want to invest in, they are springing for opportunities in other sectors of the industry.Bitcoin, obviously, is something they’re investing big in, with Burniske previously saying that the leading cryptocurrency is likely to be some of the fastest assets to recover after the ongoing coronavirus crash.Related: Venture capitalist: 2020’s coronavirus crisis will only prove the value of Bitcoin and cryptoThe investor even added that BTC and assets like it, such as Decred, have “vast” potential upside:“The potential upside of individual SoV-assets […] is vast, and because it’s hard to calculate mathematically, leaves much to the imagination. That can make these fan-favorites for large swathes of society.”Burniske also identified Ethereum-based “capital assets,” such as Maker and 0x tokens, as assets Placeholder wants to invest in due to their potential to “surpass equities in how they globally provision services, govern stakeholders, and distribute value.”Posted In: Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

83,CryptoSlate,Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson: Founders must decouple from the cryptocurrency,Priyeshu Garg,1588144800.0,"In the latest episode of the “Untold Stories” podcast, host Charlie Shrem discussed the topic of adoption in crypto with Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano. The two agreed that the loss of faith in government institutions has set a good foundation for cryptocurrencies to step in, which means that more effort needed to be made in making crypto available and accessible to everyone.Cryptocurrencies are the ultimate rejection of government, but adoption is still far awayThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted one of the deepest, hardest problems humanity currently faces—the lack of a single truthful narrative. This, according to Charles Hoskinson, has resulted in an overwhelming animosity towards centralized governing entities, causing a rift both in politics and in the everyday lives of ordinary people.The CEO of IOHK discussed this, alongside a myriad of other topics, in the latest episode of the “Untold Stories” podcast with Charlie Shrem. Shrem, the founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation and one of the most influential people in crypto, went deep with Hoskinson in the issues the world currently faces.Unsurprisingly, the answers to most of them seem to lie in cryptocurrencies.Hoskinson said that the ongoing pandemic has only exacerbated the huge inequalities and injustices in the world, which will most likely result in a political revolution. The problem of divisiveness both in the media and the government, especially in the U.S., is what fueled the growth of the crypto industry in the first place.“When you think about it, cryptocurrencies are the ultimate rejection of the government,” Hoskinson said in the podcast.With a lack of trust in centralized entities comes an increase in trust in the decentralized systems that underlie cryptocurrencies. However, both Hoskinson and Shrem agreed that there is still a lot to be done in the crypto space before it reaches mainstream adoption.The best way for this to happen, Hoskinson said, was through payment gateways for merchants. If cryptocurrencies could easily be used to buy things, more people would get into it for the sheer convenience.However, merchant adoption has always been notoriously slow. Hoskinson said that one of the main issues merchants face with crypto is the issue of stability.“What we’ve seen with merchants, historically, is that they’ll only take a crypto asset if they have a quick path of either locking in the value or divesting the asset.”Without a seamless way of converting cryptocurrencies into fiat currency, merchants will be slow to adopt. However, a seamless way of converting crypto to fiat is essentially worthless if merchants will hesitate to accept tokens due to their volatility.Creating a circular economy and banking the unbankedMost services that offer the conversion step to merchants are heavily involved either in trading cryptocurrencies or in the traditional banking system, which leaves very little space for innovation. Hoskinson said he believes the best way to onboard merchants isn’t through new products, but rather through integration with existing payment processors such as Square.And while this would certainly increase adoption, it still won’t be the “real deal.” According to Hoskinson, the real adoption won’t come until merchants actually stop exchanging cryptocurrencies into fiat.To do that, merchants will need to see a token with all of the advantages of cryptocurrencies but without the volatility. Hoskinson said that it would be the perfect place for stablecoins to step in.There has been a lot of hype around the possibility of hosting a stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain once it reaches full maturity. Hoskinson himself discussed the idea at length and seemed to believe that it was the only logical way to go forward for Cardano. In the podcast, he said that it made sense to have a stablecoin on Cardano that would be tied to the underlying asset of the network, ADA and fiat currency, while also having the backing of third-party intermediaries. A stablecoin, he said, has always been in the Cardano roadmap.Related: Charles Hoskinson thinks a Cardano-powered stablecoin will “blow everyone out of the water”He explained that this method will have a twofold advantage—firstly, it would incentivize merchants to keep the tokens as they are and not exchange them into fiat currency, creating a circular economy that would further strengthen the network.Secondly, it would also provide a platform for merchants that are unbanked. Hoskinson cited the example of the cannabis industry in the U.S., where almost all companies rely solely on cash. Being unable to get bank accounts, companies are faced with a myriad of problems, such as how to pay taxes. Shrem noted that other marginalized, but burgeoning industries such as the porn and the arms industries could also benefit from such a platform.Knowing that convenience and speed are of the utmost importance to systems like this, Hoskinson said that IOHK has been experimenting with making payments work on smartphones. The company could be adding “hooks” into the Cardano software suite that would make it easier to integrate with various payment protocols down the line.With the implementation of Ouroboros, Cardano’s scaling protocol, will also make microtransactions possible, Hoskinson said. When combined with the stability of a stablecoin, it could be used for everything from tipping to lending.Related: Cardano-parent IOHK says the Ouroboros BFT is ready to be deployedThe introduction of cryptocurrency wallets in the latest Samsung Galaxy smartphone series showed that there is a future in mobile-based crypto payment processors. Hoskinson believes that we could see similar experiences built into iPhones and other operating systems in the next three or four years.Innovations such as that most likely won’t happen in developed countries.“Necessity is the mother of all invention,” Hoskinson said, adding that the most innovative products have a tendency of being built-in ecosystems such as Africa, where a lack of trust in governments and a scarcity of resources results in creativity.These projects will bring about the de-dollarization of the world, which makes both Hoskinson and Shrem, extremely bullish on cryptocurrencies.Decoupling Cardano from Charles HoskinsonHoskinson’s optimism in the future of Cardano seems to stem from his ability to distance himself from the project. Shrem said that one of the main issues some of the cryptocurrencies on the market face is the “key man” problem. When a project is too tightly wound to a specific person, as is the case with Ethereum and Vitalik Buterin, it tends to shake the community’s confidence in its future.This, Hoskinson said, isn’t the case with Cardano. He explained that those holding ADA and invested in Cardano know that when Charles Hoskinson dies, Cardano will continue to operate, academic papers will continue to be published, and research will go on uninterrupted.Putting in place Cardano’s treasury will enable Cardano to become a truly decentralized network. The voting system that will come with the Goguen era will enable people to express their opinions about the state of the network and ask for money to fund development.For the sake of the community, Hoskinson believes that founders need to have a Satoshi-like attitude about stepping away from power and leaving their networks to the community. Therefore, it won’t be Hoskinson, IOHK, or the Cardano Foundation that run Cardano, but the community itself. Its governance systems will allow the community to work their way through controversies and implement changes in the protocol.This was one of the main problems Hoskinson faced when working on Ethereum. The main difference between him and Vitalik Buterin, he explained, was Hoskinson’s belief that governance is essential for a cryptocurrency. Buterin, instead, saw governance as being a less important aspect of a crypto network.The lack of governance was what caused massive schisms in the world’s two largest cryptocurrencies, which resulted in wars that yielded hardforks such as Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic.Without massive internal fights over the future of the protocol, a network would become more attractive to large institutions and enterprises. And with an inclusive and decentralized way of doing cutting edge science and research, Hoskinson believes Cardano is on its way to achieving this.Posted In: Cardano, Adoption, Altcoins, People     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

84,CryptoSlate,Chainlink continues onboarding new investors as bulls defend critical support level,Cole Petersen,1588120500.0,"Chainlink has seen a notable recovery in the time following its latest selloff, with the cryptocurrency’s buyers defending it from dropping below the strong support that has been established around $3.50.It just so happens that this level coincides with a critical technical support level that was briefly tapped during the course of this latest downtrend, and bull’s ardent defense of the level signals that it may be poised to see further near-term upside.This volatility hasn’t stopped new investors from rushing into the altcoin either, as data signals that new investors are still accumulating LINK at rapid rates – even in the time following its major dip from its all-time highs.Chainlink bounces at key level as bulls defend mid-term uptrendChainlink witnessed some notable selling pressure yesterday that led the crypto to decline all the way to its key support level at $3.50. This movement came about independent of the aggregated crypto market, as Bitcoin and most other major altcoins were consolidating at this time.This plunge proved to be fleeting, however, as buyers quickly pushed it back up to highs of $3.75 earlier today, from which point it has only declined slightly to its current price of $3.66.In addition to having horizontal support at $3.50, this level also happens to coincide closely with LINK’s 200-day moving average – a technical level of the utmost importance.How assets respond to their 200MA can offer incredibly valuable insight into their long-term strength, and a dip below this level for Chainlink would have been dire for its macro-uptrend.One popular analyst on Twitter who posts under the moniker “Teddy” offered a chart in a recent tweet showing the clean bounce it posted after tapping this level.Image Courtesy of TeddyLINK continues attracting new investors despite decline from all-time highsChainlink’s notable decline from its all-time highs of nearly $5.00 hasn’t phased new investors, as data regarding the growth of the cryptocurrency’s wallet addresses with a non-zero balance paints a positive picture for its underlying strength.This data, sourced from analytics platform IntoTheBlock, shows that new Chainlink wallets with a balance just climbed to fresh all-time highs this month, continuing to trend higher even in the face of its sharp decline from its all-time highs.Image Courtesy of IntoTheBlockThis means that LINK’s intense uptrend may be underpinned by solid buying pressure stemming from new investors.Couple this with the defense of the cryptocurrency’s 200-day moving average, and it does appear that Chainlink has the potential to see significant further upside in the days and weeks ahead.

85,CryptoSlate,Circulating supply data signals XRP may be undervalued; analysts remain skeptical,Cole Petersen,1588149000.0,"It’s no secret that XRP has been one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies throughout both 2019 and even 2020, incurring a significant 40 percent loss against USD last year while failing to catch the full momentum seen by its peers in the early part of 2020.This price action has been driven by a plethora of different reasons – including the crypto’s massive circulating supply, large quarterly token sales from Ripple, and a lack of proven utility.There is some hope for embattled investors who are looking for an opportunity to exit their XRP positions, however, as data regarding the actual circulating supply being significantly lower than its reported circulating supply indicates that it may be undervalued.XRP’s actual circulating supply may be lower than reportedXRP has seen some tempered momentum today, climbing over 6 percent as Bitcoin and the aggregated crypto market continue consolidating.It is important to note that the cryptocurrency is now surmounting its key resistance around $0.20, and a sustained hold above this level could prove to be extremely bullish for it.One fundamental development that could bolster the crypto further in the near-term comes from a recent update from analytics platform Coin Metrics, in which they note that the actual circulating XRP supply may be 30 billion.This is a significantly lower number than the reported 44 billion that has played into the token’s valuation.“Applying the Coin Metrics Free Float Supply Methodology to XRP indicates that there are 30B of a total 100B XRP that are available for trading within the market.”Image Courtesy of CoinmetricsAnalysts still wary about the token’s valueAlthough from a purely technical standpoint a lower-than-expected circulating supply is bullish, analysts still believe that the cryptocurrency may never see a full recovery back towards its all-time highs.As CryptoSlate reported yesterday, one analyst named Cantering Clark recently explained that lots of tokens with “promising tech” will never be able to recover from the technical damage done by the multi-year bear market – XRP included.“Here are just a few of the hundreds of 10-year charts you can find for ‘promising tech’. See a similarity? Many of these same charts have forums of people still talking about the recovery to come.”Image Courtesy of Cantering ClarkHe isn’t alone in this sentiment, as many other analysts including veteran trader Peter Brandt have offered similar outlooks for XRP.Time will tell as to whether or not the potential fundamental boost stemming from the newly released data regarding XRP’s circulating supply is enough to propel it higher.

86,CryptoSlate,Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson: Bitcoin (BTC) is an example of low development velocity,Priyeshu Garg,1587970800.0,"Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of Cardano (ADA) parent IOHK, went to YouTube to answer questions regarding the recent launch of the Daedalus wallet and the current state of the Cardano network. Hoskinson said that Daedalus has been a tremendous success, the only issues due to sync times happening to users with older Windows operating systems. The recent audit by company Root9B will be one of many audits of Cardano’s code, with other companies selected for the role in the future.Daedalus has been an overwhelming successThe launch of the Daedalus mainnet wallet version 1.0.0 has been a tremendous success both for IOHK as a company and Cardano as a network. These are the words of Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK and founder of Cardano, who took to YouTube to answer some of the questions regarding the current state of Cardano.In the AMA, Hoskinson said that Daedalus had shipped with very little issues. Almost all of the issues users reported were about instant crashes and extremely long sync times, which received a significant amount of press despite being minuscule in the grand scheme of things.Related: Cardano (ADA) parent IOHK releases Daedalus mainnet walletAccording to Hoskinson, a good deal of those cases came from users that have downloaded the wallet on operating systems that aren’t supported by the code. Those running Windows 8 or lower were most likely the ones that have experienced the majority of the issues, which is why IOHK is looking into blacklisting these operating systems in the near future.Hoskinson said the decision to do so was very reasonable, especially considering the fact that Microsoft itself has discontinued support for operating systems lower than Windows 8.Aside from the crashes, some users have also complained about lengthy sync times. This, Hoskinson said, is an anomaly as most users are reporting sync times between 50 minutes and two hours. Nonetheless, IOHK is looking into the problem and suspects that a rare configuration caused the delays. This is often the case when building products for Windows, Hoskinson said, which is why IOHK wrote the Daedalus code for the most common configuration.The question of treasury, decentralization, and the Root9B auditOne of the most prevailing questions regarding the current state of Cardano was the issue of the Cardano treasury. Set up as a fund to be used to further Cardano’s development when IOHK’s mandate runs out, the treasury is endowed partly with newly minted ADA) and transaction fees.Hoskinson said that the Shelley Incentivized Testnet (ITN) was set up so that there was inflation at every slot, which then got divided into two buckets—one for the rewards and one for the treasury. When Shelley is finally activated, all of the rewards from the ITN will get moved to the mainnet, including the treasury.Related: Everything you need to know about Cardano’s Shelley incentivized testnetHowever, the transaction fees on the Cardano have not gone to the treasury as originally planned. Instead, all of the fees on the mainnet were burned. Hoskinson noted that this has not affected ADA’s price or volume, as only about $50,000 worth of fees has been burned in Cardano’s entire lifetime.The question of the treasury led to a discussion about Cardano’s future as a decentralized system. Some viewers were wondering how new code will be released when Cardano emerges as a fully decentralized system and is completely governed by its users.This isn’t something IOHK isn’t thinking about extensively, Hoskinson said. Huge efforts are being made both within IOHK and the Cardano Foundation to create a system that will enable users to manage software updates after the Shelley and Goguen eras. There are two main problems to be solved with this—maintaining a developer velocity and creating a meritocratic, egalitarian system.Hoskinson cited Bitcoin as an example of what happens when there’s no development velocity and only a small number of people actually participate in its maintenance.Cardano most likely won’t have these problems in the future, thanks in part to the Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). All Cardano updates in the post-Shelley and Goguen eras will be looked at as a collection of CIPs, which will be voted on by the community.And while there’s still a lot to figure out along the way, Hoskinson said that the CIP Committee will make a presentation at the upcoming Cardano virtual summit on how the collaborative process might work when fully decentralized.But, until decentralization comes, the code upon which Cardano is being built needs to be rock solid. IOHK has put in great efforts to do so, with its in-house audits, extensive use of formal methods, and relentless testing of every phase of Cardano’s release.However, it wasn’t until the latest third-party audit into Cardano that the community really began to take interest in the matter. The latest audit, which is available online to the public, was conducted by a company called Root9B. Hoskinson said that the company and some of its employees were criticized by members of the Cardano community, which he believes was unfair.Root9B has been selected as the best candidate for the latest audit due to the company’s history of working with military and government contracts. Usually tasked with looking for incredibly difficult exploits which are light years away from most cryptographic systems used today, IOHK felt that Root9B will be up to the task of auditing Cardano.“They wanted to get into the blockchain space so this seemed like a natural fit,” Hoskinson said.And while he further defended IOHK’s choice of Root9B, Hoskinson said that they won’t be the first nor the last company hired to audit Cardano. IOHK plans on rotating several different auditors, as it believes it is the best practice in the industry. All of the future audits will most likely be done on a regular cadence, either bi-annually or quarterly, Hoskinson said, adding that this will ensure a high level of scrutiny into IOHK’s work. However, the frequency of these audits will ultimately be decided on by the Cardano community if IOHK doesn’t get its contract to run the network renewed.Until then, IOHK will continue to put in immense work into making Cardano a commercially viable product. One of the steps that will lead the company in that direction is the launch of Cardano.org, which is set to be the first major deliverable from the McCann advertising company working on the brand refresh. The website, filled with new documentation and with a refreshed look, will most likely roll out in May or June, while other brand-related improvements will come in the following months, Hoskinson said.Posted In: Bitcoin, Cardano, Altcoins, People, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

87,CryptoSlate,Ethereum active addresses rocket as crucial moment fast approaches,Cole Petersen,1587636000.0,"Ethereum has seen a notable price spike today that has come in tandem with a recovery seen across the aggregated cryptocurrency market. This movement has allowed ETH to recapture its position above $180 as Bitcoin navigates into the $7,000 region.One interesting fundamental development that has coincided with Ethereum’s recent price rise is that its number of active addresses has been rocketing upwards, rapidly approaching its one-year highs.This heightened activity from investors comes as the crypto nears what analysts are calling a “crucial moment” that could determine which direction the asset trends in the weeks to come.Ethereum pushes higher as market participants grow increasingly activeAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading up just over five percent at its current price of $182, up from daily lows set within the lower-$170 region yesterday.This climb came about concurrently with that seen by Bitcoin and most other cryptos, and ETH is currently one of the best performing altcoins – only trailing the 24-hour gains seen by Tezos by roughly 2%.This movement marks an extension of the uptrend that Ethereum first incurred when it dipped to its sub-$100 yearly lows in mid-March, and bulls are beginning to show some notable signs of strength.One factor that could influence ETH’s price trend in the near-term is increased market participation rates amongst investors.According to data from analytics platform Glassnode, Ethereum’s active address count has spiked in recent times, climbing from 200,000 in early-March to nearly 400,000 by the end of the month.Image Courtesy of GlassnodeAlthough the data is trailing by a couple of weeks, it is possible that this trend has extended due to the strength of its uptrend seen throughout April.The highest active wallet count that Ethereum has seen in the past year is 450,000 – a number that may soon be surpassed.It’s a critical moment for ETH from a technical perspectiveThis heightened market participation rate comes as Ethereum enters what analysts are describing as a “crucial moment.”One popular pseudonymous options trader on Twitter named Chase_NL spoke about this in a recent tweet, explaining that how Ethereum and Bitcoin react relative to each other will offer key insights into where they will both trend in the weeks ahead.“Crucial moment here for BTC and ETH. Can ETH rally hard enough to bring BTC back above the yearly open? Or will BTC’s sluggishness and inability to close above the yearly open bring ETH back downwards? This will set my ‘bias’ for the coming days/week most likely.”The coming days are likely to hold in store further volatility for Ethereum, as the ballooning market participation rates are bound to magnify the intensity of movements in both directions.Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

88,CryptoSlate,Could DAI be the biggest threat to Ethereum DeFi? This analyst thinks so,Priyeshu Garg,1587536880.0,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been one of the most used buzz-words in the crypto industry last year. The rise of applications built on the Ethereum network was followed by an equally high rise of the expectations people had from the newly created industry—a decentralized answer to the problems with the current financial system.One of the projects that have led the DeFi evolution was MKR, a project that used Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency ether (ETH) to back a stablecoin that could facilitate fast money transfers and various other financial applications.However, one analyst believes that MKR and its DAI stablecoin shouldn’t be the DeFi darling that it is, as it poses a huge threat to the entire DeFi ecosystem. Adam Cochran, a professor of information science at Conestoga College and partner at Metacartel Ventures, said that DAI has gone astray in the past year and laid out several reasons for this.Firstly, he said that almost all DeFi protocols rely, at least somewhat, on all of the tokens in their system not breaking, which means that they have to transfer properly, be actually worth their value, and come from a trusted origin. This applies to Compound, Fulcrum, SET, Aave, Uniswap, and all other similar protocols that rely on collateralization or liquidity pooling.However, the interconnectedness of DeFi applications has caused them to act more like a house of cards instead of a layer of structurally sound blocks, Cochran explained.Various DeFi applications on the Ethereum network. (Source: Medium)“This connectivity is our biggest benefit and our greatest risk,” he said.As there’s no card that appears in more DeFi products than DAI, it becomes clear that it sits at the base of most of the ecosystem.This wasn’t that big of a problem for most, Cochran said until DAI began showing very serious vulnerabilities. The first problem he highlights is the fact that DAI isn’t actually governed by all MKR holders, but rather a small group of powerful entities—the MakerDAO team, MKR, and venture capital firm A16z led by Andreessen Horowitz. Cochran pointed out that the top 50 wallet addresses have more than 50 percent of all voting authority in the protocol.Percentage of voting authority in the MKR protocol. (Source: Medium)Therefore, with the majority of the vote belonging to several major entities, its users can’t rely on them doing what’s best for the system. Cochran said that the MakerDAO team had a history of withholding valuable information from the public, as well as forcing out many of its executives due to “directional differences.”Apart from that, the company secretly tried to trademark the term “DeFi,” which Cochran believes was the final nail in the coffin for MKR governance. He explained:“DAI is not decentralized, because MKR is not decentralized. MakerDAO makes the decisions, and it’s clear they have a history of making bad ones.”All of this leads to Cochran’s final point, which is MakerDAO’s plan to switch from a single-collateral DAI to a multi-collateral DAI. This means that instead of just ETH backing the coin, DAI will be backed with a basket of different ERC-20 tokens. This major decision was made by only 54 people, as they had the majority of the voting power on the network—those 56 people only represented 7.56 percent of the total MKR circulating supply.It’s interesting to note that 100 percent of votes were in favor of the decision.The proposal for introducing multi-collateral DAIFor now, this basket only includes the Basic Attention Token (BAT) and USDC, but the list could be expanded to include more assets with ease. Cochran wrote:“These assets were added without big wallets voting, but what happens when a16z decides that one of the projects they’ve invested in should become part of the MCD? They vote for it, they put pressure on MKR to vote for, and other investors follow suit.”Therefore, DAI has the potential to become an incredibly risky basket of assets, which could take the entire DeFi ecosystem down with it if it experiences even the slightest volatility.Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, Analysis, DeFi     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

89,CryptoSlate,"This AI-focused cryptocurrency is up 300%, but on-chain fundamentals spell trouble",Ali Martinez,1587525960.0,"While the global financial markets were melting down as coronavirus spread throughout the planet, there was one cryptocurrency that managed to weather the storm.Numeraire, an altcoin brought to life to incentivize scientists to predict financial models using encrypted data, was able to enter a parabolic advance that has seen its price skyrocket over 3x in the past three months. The AI-centric cryptocurrency went from trading at a low of $6 in late January to recently hitting a high of $24.NMR/USD by TradingViewThe bull run that NMR experienced in such a short period of time is quite impressive given the current economic environment. However, everything could be part of a pump-and-dump scheme, according to Santiment.The actors behind Numeraire’s rallyThe behavior analytics firm argued that Teeka Tiwari and his Palm Beach Research Group could be behind Numeraire’s sudden bullish impulse.Dino Ibisbegovic, head of content and SEO at Santiment, explained:“As part of his Palm Beach Confidential programme, last month Teeka picked 5 coins that he believes will make you a multimillionaire. According to multiple people, NMR was included here as well… Teeka’s coin picks often have a way of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, as PBC hopefuls swarm to buy the suggested tokens in bulk, making their charts look like it’s 2017 all over again.”Even though it is impossible to determine how much of the pump can be attributed to Tiwari, on-chain data reveals that one massive whale was preparing for this price action.Indeed, a few weeks before Numeraire began surging there was a significant spike in the token’s exchange inflow. One address sent 100,000 NMR, worth roughly $620,000 at the time, to a Bittrex wallet on Jan. 26.This transfer represents one of the biggest single-day moves in Numeraire’s history, affirmed Ibisbegovic.Numeraire’s Exchange Inflow by SantimentIs the dump incoming?Now that the AI-focused altcoin is up more than 300 percent, there are not any fundamental metrics that support a further increase in its price.Ibisbegovic pointed out that the number of active addresses is declining as well as the network growth. The downtrend in these on-chain indexes can be considered as a negative sign.Ibisbegovic said:“Unless the coin’s on-chain activity makes a strong u-turn in the very near future, it’s going to be increasingly difficult for the coin to support a sustained rally.”Numeraire’s Network Activity by SantimentGiven the state of Numeraire’s network, the entities behind the exponential upswing could now be preparing to dump their tokens as Marcel Burger, founder of digital assets consultancy BurgerCrypto.com, stated:“[It’s] time to get rid of some NMR here. Was a nice ride. Happy to buy back in at lower levels again. Numerai is still one of those projects I really like, but thanks to palm beach confidential pumping it, I rather sell here to buy back lower.”Even if NMR continues surging, market participants must remain cautious about what is happening behind closed doors to avoid getting caught on the wrong side of the trend.

This was the first time the entire launch was explained in great detail, highlighting all of the processes that will need to be completed to bring full decentralization to the network.Hoskison then joined in on an episode of The Cardano Effect podcast to discuss some of the details and answer questions from the community.One of the first questions addressed in the podcast was the issue of transferring ADA from the Incentivized Testnet (ITN) to the Shelley mainnet. Hoskinson said that only the rewards made from staking on the network will be transferred to the mainnet, not the ADA that was included in the snapshot.Related: Everything you need to know about Cardano’s Shelley incentivized testnetFor example, if a user had 10,000 ADA during the snapshot, 10,000 ADA was duplicated on the ITN. If the same user made 1,000 ADA from staking rewards, his ITN balance would be 11,000 ADA. However, when withdrawing funds to the mainnet, only the 1,000 ADA made from rewards would be transferred, not the entire balance.Hoskinson also addressed the question of how the decision of when to decrease the percentage of blocks being produced by the Cardano federation will be taken. The decrease, described with a d-parameter, will be updated manually, he explained, with the IOHK being the entity that chooses when the parameter will decrease.Keeping the update manual was a decision made way before the ITN was launched, he said, which is why it was kept as simple as possible. He anticipates that a decision how much to decrease the parameter will be made every 4 to 5 days, but that it will most likely follow a predetermined schedule.“There is no reason to believe that the process will last more than two months”.All of the metrics that will need to be achieved in order to decrease the parameter, i.e. reduce the number of blocks being produced by IOHK, the Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo, will be shared with the public. The only reason they haven’t been released yet, Hoskinson said, is because a post mortem needs to be done on the testnet once it shuts down.When it comes to large exchanges updating to Shelley, Hoskinson said that they will need between 4 and 6 weeks to update their software, which is why the update window will last around 1,5 months. Exchanges that support ADA and fail to upgrade to the new Shelley code will have trouble validating transactions, as the old Byron code won’t be able to recognize the newly implemented Bech32 address format.Related: Cardano (ADA) update: most problems with PoS solved, Byron reboot bug-freeIOHK also doesn’t expect Daedalus to have any connectivity issues during the transition to Shelley. If some issues due arise, that will most likely be due to problems with the Windows OS. Updating to Daedalus Flight will be able to solve most of these minor issues for users.Hardforks and multi-asset supportThe topic of hard forks on the Cardano networks was also heavily discussed during the podcast. Multiple users wondered whether or not hard forks would be possible once Shelley launched, to which Hoskinson replied that it’s still a work in progress.Bitcoin and Ethereum have hard forks of the networks live outside the system, while the Tezos protocol has its hard forks on-chain and is aware of their existence. According to Hoskinson, Cardano will most likely have a hybrid approach towards hardforks. The Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) will make hard forks possible and the system will be able to distinguish between the forked systems. The hard fork combinator still needs a lot of work, with Hoskinson saying it will evolve eventually.The hard forks that do occur on the network will not be able to birth new coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum’s hard forks did. It will be the same ADA  on all the chains that come out of Cardano.That doesn’t mean that there won’t be other crypto assets on Cardano. Hoskinson said that Daedalus was designed to be a multi-asset wallet from the start because Cardano itself was designed to be a multi-asset network. When it comes to the concrete mechanisms that will allow the network to support various cryptocurrencies, Hoskinson said that the Daedalus backend can be reparameterized to accept any coin. It will work similar to the experience on the Ledger Live wallet, where users can download apps that support individual coins.IOHK will prioritize cryptocurrencies in the IOHK family, such as Ethereum Classic (ETC), Ethereum’s hard fork Hoskinson supported. However, the option will also be open to companies that were willing to pay Cardano operators to host their coins on the network. No information about the cost of hosting was given.Getting as many users to download and use Daedalus even if they don’t use ADA is one of IOHK’s main goals. As Daedalus itself acts as a full node on the Cardano network, the more downloads it gets, the stronger and more decentralized the network becomes.Some of the teams working on Cardano are currently looking into ways they can combine the security of a full node with the ease of use of a light wallet client into a single product. It is unclear whether this will be implemented to Daedalus or a new wallet will be built.Nonetheless, Hoskinson believes that the problem with wallet size will be completely solved in the next 3 to 5 years. As more people and entities begin using the network, the larger the blockchain becomes, and therefore harder to store on individual devices. The problem IOHK is working on is how to ensure that everyone can use the blockchain fully no matter how big it gets. Hoskinson said that recursive SNARK protocols will enable this to happen.But, before that happens, the problem of when to delete data from the blockchain will need to be addressed. He noted that the data model for the next 5 years will be how to know when and what data can be removed from the blockchain without damaging its credibility.No major dates were given for future updates, but Hoskinson did note that Daedalus Flight will have support for the Ledger wallet integrated in 3 to 5 weeks. The full firmware for Daedalus should be done by June or July, as the company contracted to complete it will have its 90 deadlines expire in late June.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

91,CryptoSlate,Analyst believes Ethereum’s ETH 2.0 will bring the largest economic shift in crypto,Priyeshu Garg,1587355860.0,"The upcoming release of Ethereum’s second iteration, ETH 2.0, has been highly contested, but one data analyst believes it could be the driving force behind the largest economic growth in society. Adam Cochran, a professor of information science at Conestoga College, said that Ethereum’s economic policy will result in a reduced supply and a drastically increased demand due to the attractive incentives from staking.Tweetstorm by Adam CochranStaking rewards will onboard large institutions, lead to retail FOMOAccording to Cochran, the Phase 0 of Ethereum’s second iteration will be what gets the upcoming economic shift going. In a lengthy Twitter thread, the information science professor and former marketing executive at Dogecoin laid out some of the things that will happen once the Ethereum network becomes a proof-of-stake one.Firstly, the 3-5 percent yearly returns on staking will make Ethereum attractive to large investors, as they usually look for stable returns in that range. In order to push down staking rewards to that range, between 10 and 30 million ETH would need to be locked into ETH 2.0 validators, which represents 10 to 30 percent of the coin’s total circulating supply.Locking up that much of the circulating supply creates a supply shock, Cochran explained, saying that the scarcity will create a price spike.The price spike will push those same investors into buying more ETH in order to stake more of it, which would, in turn, create a ripple effect causing a general market upturn. The FOMO among retail investors will reach its peak and begin buying heavily into ETH to make sure they don’t “miss out,” Cochran said,But, unlike the bull run in 2017, this one will happen much faster as there are more fiat on-ramps available and hundreds of millions of verified users on major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.Long-term prognosis looks even more bullish for ETHWhile the surge in retail investors will push ETH’s price up, its effects won’t be as short-lived as in previous bull markets.Besides staking, Ethereum 2.0 will bring about scalability, allowing dApps built on the network to handle more users and increase their consumer viability. With more applications available, the network is set to see a significant uptick in users. Cochran said that the result of this was simple—the more actual demand there is to use the system then the more the price goes up, because there is a real underlying value being created for the user.Once the price of ETH goes up, whales will begin buying more ETH in order to put more money back into staking. However, this can’t go on forever, as more nodes in the network cause the overall payout to everyone to be lower. So, in order to continue earning at the same rate as before, whales would not only have to buy more ETH, but also stake more of the ETH they buy.Cochran wrote:“This, in turn, creates scarcity, increasing the price, which in turn results in more whales buying to stake”This is the situation where Ethereum’s complex monetary policy comes into place. It dictates that ethers can’t be staked in fractions, but rather in allotments of 32. That means that the minimum amount that can be staked is 32 ETH. Cochran noted that a whale with 20 ETH looking to stake his holdings would need to round it up to 32 ETH, buying 12 coins more either with fiat or other cryptocurrencies.Cochran explained:“This is one of the most effective components of ETH’s new layout, as whales will pour new money into the market to continue to round-up their stakable amounts of ETH.”And finally, one of the least thought-about parts of Ethereum 2.0 are the changes in gas fees on the network. EIP-1559, an improvement proposal made in 2018 by Vitalik Buterin, will be what ultimately “seals the deal” when it comes to the growth of value on Ethereum, Cochran said.Implementing the proposal means that all of the transaction fees (or gas fees, as they’re called on the network) will be burned, with miners profiting only from the “tips” users choose to pay alongside a base fee set by the network.Cochran said that early estimates show that burning of the base fees could result in around 10,000 ETH lost from the supply, but that number is expected to increase significantly as the number of users on the network grows.As the percentage of the supply lost to the base rate burning scales with usage, Cochran expects that the number of ETH burned each year will exceed the number of new ETH issued and lower the overall supply. Cochran wrote:“Many of you probably knew that the economic design between ETH2.0 was pretty smart; but, you likely hadn’t considered just how smart it was.”However, it’s worth noting that Ethereum 2.0 could take years to develop in full. Last year, the project found itself on the receiving end of a lot of criticism from its own community, who accused Buterin and the rest of its creators of lying.In October 2019, even Buterin himself said that Ethreum’s layer two solutions are proceeding “slower than expected.” Ethereum Foundation developer Jamie Pitts said that he was concerned about the project, as he felt that there was a lack of strategy and coordination between the teams working on ETH 2.0.Without a launch date in sight, serious scaling issues to overcome, and no clear road-map for transitioning tokens and smart contracts, Ethereum 2.0 will be in for a tough road ahead. The promises of a huge economic shift and an incredibly bullish community, however, seem to be keeping spirits high.Posted In: Ethereum, Adoption, Altcoins, ETH 2.0, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

92,CryptoSlate,Tezos sees growing utility as analysts remain overwhelmingly bullish,Cole Petersen,1587286680.0,"Tezos has been the rising star of the crypto market in 2019 and 2020, with its insane uptrend in recent months only being rivaled by that seen by Chainlink – which was also able to set fresh all-time highs earlier this year.The intensity of this uptrend is showing no signs of slowing down either, as each pullback is met with a significant amount of buying pressure, with many analysts noting that significantly further upside in the months ahead is within the realm of possibility.One interesting factor that could be helping to drive this growth is the increasing utility seen by the crypto, with the latest example of this being a new form of tokenized real estate that is being brought to the Tezos blockchain.Tezos dodges market-wide downturn as bulls continue roaringAt the time of writing, Tezos is trading up 1.5 percent at its current price of $2.32, which is around the level at which it has been trading at in the time following its recent rally.Although sellers were able to push it off its highs of $2.37, this is only a slight retrace while considering that it is currently up from weekly lows of $1.85 that were set this past Wednesday.Related: These fundamental flaws may be the black swan that stops Tezos from seeing massive growthThe strength of XTZ’s macro-uptrend shouldn’t be underestimated, and some analysts are now noting that all of its pullbacks are great entry opportunities due to its macro strength.One popular pseudonymous trader who goes by the name “Loma” offered this sentiment in a recent tweet in which he noted that a “solid entry is opening up” during all potential near-term pullbacks.“XTZ: Solid entry opening up here on any pullbacks we get.”This tempered bullishness comes on the heels of the crypto’s recent break above a massive resistance level against its Bitcoin trading pair that can be seen while looking towards the below chart.Image Courtesy of LomaXTZ sees growing utility as real estate market migrates to its blockchainOne interesting fundamental development that recently took place is the migration of $300 million in real estate to the Tezos blockchain.As was first reported by CoinDesk, Vertalo – a digital transfer agent – and an alternative trading system called tZERO are teaming up to tokenize a small portfolio of top-tier properties worth a cumulative total of $300 million.These tokens will be based on the Tezos blockchain, through which investors can trade and transfer the tokenized assets.It is critical that Tezos continues building fundamental utility that matches the massive growth seen by its price, as a discrepancy between the two could ultimately result in it seeing some negative price action.

93,CryptoSlate,Chainlink is “taking a shot” at another breakout as community growth skyrockets,Cole Petersen,1587205320.0,"The aggregated crypto market has seen another notable upswing today, and Chainlink is once again leading the way.Today’s bullish LINK performance comes as the crypto attempts what analysts are describing as another breakout rally that could allow it to begin its journey back up to its early-2020 highs.This momentum may be driven in part by the incredible community strength that has been established around Chainlink, even leading one billionaire Bitcoin advocate to praise the altcoin’s fervent supporters.Chainlink attempts another breakout as it leads market-wide rallyAt the time of writing, Chainlink is trading up over 6 percent at its current price of $3.70, which marks a notable upswing from daily lows of $3.45 that were set around this time yesterday.LINK’s upswing today has marked an extension of the momentum that was first incurred on April 16th when the crypto surged from lows of $3.00.This came about in tandem with BTC’s rally from $6,600, although Chainlink has been firmly outperforming the benchmark cryptocurrency in the time since.Related: Chainlink leads market-wide surge as recent technical breakout bolsters price actionThe only peer that has rivaled Chainlink’s mid-term momentum is Tezos, which is currently trading up nearly 10% against USD and 7% against its Bitcoin trading pair.One analyst on Twitter who goes by the name Big Cheds stated that today’s LINK rally marks the crypto “taking a shot at breaking out” while referencing the chart seen below.Image Courtesy of Big ChedsWill growing community strength bolster LINK?Tyler Winklevoss, the co-founder and CEO of Gemini and a prominent Bitcoin advocate, explained in a recent tweet that he “appreciates the passion” of the LINK community, noting that they are dedicated to a project with “real promise.”“I really appreciate the passion of the LINK Marines. Their fervor and dedication reminds me of the early Bitcoin and Ethereum communities. Unlike many other crypto armies, they are dedicated to a project that has real promise and technical merit.”His claims about the strength of the community aren’t unwarranted either, as data from blockchain research and analytics platform IntoTheBlock shows that the Chainlink community has seen tremendous growth in recent times across multiple social platforms.The data shows a steady climb in the number of Chainlink mentions on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, as well has a stable rise in the number of contributors on the crypto’s GitHub – all signs of a highly active and engaged community.Chainlink Github Commits (via IntoTheBlock)Will this incredible community strength be enough to push LINK back to its all-time highs of nearly $5.00 though?

94,CryptoSlate,Ethereum large transaction volume rockets on heels of report about institutional inflows,Cole Petersen,1587193200.0,"Ethereum has been one of the best performing cryptocurrencies throughout the past few days, with its recent upswing allowing it to put some significant distance between its current price levels and its recent lows.This uptrend was fueled in part by the bullishness seen in the aggregated market, but was perpetuated by news regarding a significant influx of institutional funding into the crypto in Q1 2020.Now, ETH is showing a major uptick in high-value transaction volume, indicating that large players are shifting tokens around in the midst of this recent bullishness.Ethereum sees a notable influx of institutional fundingPer Grayscale Investment’s latest quarterly report, the company notes that inflows into their Ethereum Trust have been surging as of late, flipping that seen by Bitcoin in the time following March 10th.Image Courtesy of GrayscaleThis unprecedented flip in institutional inflows marked the end to a quarter in which ETH saw a massive jump in the number of institutions directing capital towards it.Spencer Noon, the head of crypto investments at DTC Capital, spoke about the news regarding the influx of “smart money” funding into Ethereum in a recent tweet, saying:“Institutional investors are buying ETH. The cat is officially out of the bag. From the latest [Grayscale] report: Ethereum Trust saw $110M in Q1 inflows. This is more than all of its previous inflows combined for the past 2 years ($95.8M).”It’s unclear as to what the impetus for this sudden surge in institutional funding into ETH was, but it may have been partially due to its firm outperformance of Bitcoin throughout the early part of the year.ETH sees sudden uptick in large transactions, data revealsData from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock reveals an interesting trend seen by Ethereum over the past couple of days, with the crypto seeing an over 120 percent rise in large-value transactions.Large transactions – defined as those being worth over $100,000 – rose from 360 on April 15th to 819 the next day. This rise coincided with the release of the Grayscale data as well as a price rally from lows of $150 to highs of $175.ETH has seen a significant uptick in large transactions in 2020, with the average number rising significantly from that seen throughout most of 2019 – when they hovered at roughly 180 to 290 per day.Image Courtesy of IntoTheBlockThe rise in this figure may be the result of heightened institutional involvement within the market, a positive sign for Ethereum’s fundamental growth.Posted In: Ethereum, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

96,CryptoSlate,Key data metrics flip short for Litecoin as large transaction volume dives,Cole Petersen,1586773620.0,"It has been a rough year for Litecoin, with the cryptocurrency incurring some intense selling pressure throughout the past month that has led it to set fresh year-to-date lows over the course of the past few days.This weakness isn’t just limited to the past few months, however, as LTC is currently trading at price levels not seen since early January of 2019 – when it was trading within the $30 region following a brief dip to lows of $20.It is important to note that this bearishness may not alleviate anytime soon, as multiple sets of key on-chain data seem to spell trouble for the crypto’s near-term price action.Litecoin caught within strong downtrend on-chain indicators flip bearishAt the time of writing, Litecoin is trading down nearly 6 percent at its current price of $40.70, which marks a notable decline from daily highs of nearly $45.Related: Litecoin and lending platform Cred partner up to offer interest-earning services to LTC holdersThese highs were set concurrently with Bitcoin’s rapid surge to highs of $7,200, with its firm rejection here sending shockwaves throughout the crypto market that led Litecoin and many other altcoins to reel lower.This latest decline also marks an extension of the downtrend that was first incurred earlier this week when LTC plummeted from highs of nearly $58, with the drop here doing some damage to its market structure from a technical perspective.On-chain data does seem to suggest that this weakness may extend further in the days and weeks ahead.According to the blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, 60 percent of the cryptocurrency’s investors are currently underwater, which is a sign that its decline seen throughout 2019 and 2020 has left a trail of “bag holders” in its wake.As the number of investors whose Litecoin holdings are at a loss grows, the number of active wallet addresses declines – a sign that investors are growing less interested in the cryptocurrency.Litecoin Daily Active Addresses (Source: IntoTheBlock)LTC is seeing a notable decline in large transaction volumeAnother set of bear-favoring data elucidated by diving into Litecoin’s on-chain composition is that large transactions have been rather small throughout most of 2020, indicating that large traders, organizations, and institutions may lack interest in the crypto.Litecoin Transaction Volume in USD (Source: IntoTheBlock)A similar trend can be seen while looking at Bitcoin’s large transaction volume throughout the past few weeks and months, which may mean that large traders, in general, have moved to the sidelines in recent times.Without there being a notable rise in large transaction volume – which can be a sign of accumulation – it is possible that Litecoin will struggle to garner any sustainable upwards momentum.

97,CryptoSlate,"Cardano (ADA) update: most problems with PoS solved, Byron reboot bug-free",Priyeshu Garg,1586759220.0,"Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, addressed the development status of Cardano in an Easter video update, saying that the ongoing Byron reboot has been successful and bug-free. Apart from that, he revealed that huge progress is being made in terms of governance and that both the community and the Cardano team have been working on spreading the word about Cardano and educating people about the research that has been done so far.Rolling out Byron has been successfulCardano has seen major developments take place in the past few months, culminating with the release of the Byron code reboot. Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, shared the most recent updates regarding Cardno in an Easter video, saying that everything has been going according to plan.The currently ongoing Byron reboot has been successful, fixing some of the network, window, and syncing issues users have been reporting. An update to the Daedalus mainnet, which is set to absorb some of the Flight adaptations of the Cardano Node 1.10, will most likely happen during this week, Hoskinson said.Related: Cardano (ADA) product managers say ITN a huge success, Byron reboot will solve major problemsWhile this will be a substantial upgrade, more users will directly benefit from the improvement made to the Windows codebase. Two more consensus nodes have been replaced in the past week, which means that two of the seven core consensus nodes are running the rebooted Byron code.This allows IOHK to test this infrastructure on Shelley, as the network stack for the Byron reboot will be used with the upcoming mainnet. The Wallet backend has also seen some of its features get de-risked for use with the Incentivized Testne (ITN)t—as the user experience for the Shelley mainnet will be similar to the ITN, the Wallet is ready to go.Hoskinson explained that now that the Byron reboot is underway, there should be a running Shelley node released internally “fairly soon.”Switching to a public testnetAccording to Hoskinson, the next testnet that is set to be released on the network will be connecting the wallet backend to the Cardano node. This, he explained in the video, will allow users to enter keywords into client software so that mainnet wallets and testnet earnings can get consolidated together. Doing this through a testnet will enable IOHK to solve any issues that may arise with accounting, but won’t be possible when the mainnet launches. After Shelley, the Haskell testnet will be run “for a bit” to bring the pieces together—its end will finally bring about the beginning of the Shelley era.The only concrete date given in the update has been the audit from Root9B. The company, which conducted a vulnerability audit of the network, should publish the results of the report by Apr. 17, Hoskinson said, adding that they planned on releasing the audit to the public immediately after.However, while extremely valuable, the audit currently in remediation at Root9B is a static audit. To examine the design, protocol, and software in-depth, a dynamic audit needs to be performed. The Cardano Foundation, a non-profit organization tasked with running and promoting the Cardano network, is currently negotiating with Root9B to perform this audit.IOHK’s internal audit team has discovered numerous issues through their own research but has managed to resolve most of them. The Byron reboot, surprisingly enough, has been relatively bug-free, Hoskinson noted.IOHK makes major strides in governance, education, and marketingThe biggest developments, however, have to do with governance. While full decentralization and community-led governance won’t happen until the Voltaire era of Cardano, serious discussions are being led about its aspects.Hoskinson seemed content about all the work that is currently being done when it comes to addressing governance, saying very productive meetings have been held in the past weeks. Cardano improvement proposals, enhancement proposals, funding streams, and Voltaire have all been discussed in-depth.These discussions aren’t in vain—Hoskinson said that they will help practically implementing the Voltaire protocols.When it comes to other future eras of Cardano, Hoskinson said that smart contracts on the networks have gotten to a point where third party developers can use them to build applications. “This will be crucial to launching the Goguen Era,” he explained.But, before the Shelley and then Goguen eras come, heavy efforts need to be made to educate the world about Cardano. This has been a long-standing plan both at the Cardano Foundation and IOHK, but it was the Cardano community that has realized the most steps. Hoskinson said that a Wikipedia entry on Cardano has been in the making and should be uploaded soon. At IOHK, content around Cardano’s proof-of-stake protocol Ouroboros is being created “aggressively.”“The time has come to explain the papers that we have already written. It is important that people know we have solved most of the major problems with proof-of-stake,” he said.There is a great deal of content that still needs to be produced, but efforts on their production will be done alongside an extensive marketing plan. This plan, which is being developed at McCann Dublin, is currently in the phase of answering the unique selling proposition question of Cardano. While there is a lot that needs to be asked and analyzed, Hoskinson said that there was one question that kept coming back—” Why do we do research?”Once all of these questions are answered, the company will create a two-dimensional plan. The first dimension will articulate what IOHK, the Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo have accomplished so far.

98,CryptoSlate,Chainlink leads market-wide surge as recent technical breakout bolsters price action,Cole Petersen,1586761200.0,"Bitcoin’s swift break above $7,000 seen earlier today has led the cryptocurrency market to rise concurrently with it, and Chainlink appears to be leading this market-wide rally.The highly bullish crypto – which has a tendency of moving parabolically – is trading up significantly from its recent lows that were set yesterday, and just set fresh weekly highs.This comes as on-chain data shows that the crypto is beginning to break its correlation with Bitcoin, which is an occurrence that has historically transpired just before the crypto enters fresh parabolic uptrends.This means that the rally LINK has seen throughout the past week may be just the early phases of what’s to come in the days and weeks ahead.At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading up just under 12 percent at its current price of $3.55, which marks a notable climb from recent lows of $3.10 that were set yesterday.This rally also marks a firm extension of the uptrend that the cryptocurrency has been caught within throughout the past week, as it is trading up massively from its early-April lows of $2.25 that were set last weekend.In the near-term, it is highly probable that the crypto will continue being bolstered by its recent ascending triangle breakout.One popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter who goes by the name Teddy spoke about the result of this technical breakout in a recent tweet, explaining that Chainlink is already trading up over 45 percent in the time following the confirmation of this bullish pattern.“The gift the keeps on giving, it clearly has no idea of what ‘correcting’ may mean. 45% since breaking resistance of ascending triangle.”Image Courtesy of TeddyLINK’s decoupling with Bitcoin could mean a parabolic movement is inboundOne interesting occurrence that investors should be aware of is that Chainlink is currently flashing early signs of breaking its correlation with Bitcoin, which is a historically bullish occurrence.According to data from on-chain analysis platform IntoTheBlock, LINK’s correlation with Bitcoin has been declining over the past two weeks, coming off of a period of being incredibly high.Image Courtesy of IntoTheBlockThis decline is perpetuating as LINK begins to outperform Bitcoin, and while looking at the above chart, sharp drops in the crypto’s correlation to BTC tend to be correlated with parabolic upside movements.If this correlation continues to break, it is possible that Chainlink will see further upwards momentum independent of Bitcoin, potentially entering yet another parabolic cycle.

101,CryptoSlate,Ethereum sees rocketing open interest and futures volume; here’s what this means,Cole Petersen,1586238240.0,"Ethereum has found itself caught within a firm and unwavering uptrend throughout the past 48-hours, with Bitcoin’s surge past $7,000 providing ETH with some significant momentum that has allowed it to outperform the aggregated market.This rally has led the cryptocurrency to see a massive surge in futures trading volume and open interest (OI) on popular trading platform BitMEX, with both of these things being a sign that the crypto will see further near-term volatility.Because ETH has underlying technical strength and has formed what is widely considered to be a bullish market structure, it is a possibility that the crypto will soon rally towards $200.Ethereum volatility unlikely to let up anytime soon, data showsEthereum’s recent rally has allowed it to surge from multi-day lows of $140 to highs of nearly $175, with the crypto only trading down marginally from this level.This rally has allowed ETH to outperform Bitcoin, and data now seems to suggest that analysts anticipate it to see a further extension of this volatility in the near-term.According to data from research and analytics platform Skew, Ethereum saw a notable surge in its futures volume on April 6th, with this uptick in volume stemming from Binance, Huobi, and OKEx.Ethereum Futures – Aggregated Daily Volumes (Source: Skew)As seen on the above chart, this led futures volume to rocket from roughly $1 billion on April 5th to $3 billion on the 6th, hitting levels not seen since March 20th, which is when the crypto rallied from $115 to $150.Concurrently with the rise in futures, open interest on Bitmex also rose sharply, a sign that retail traders are also anticipating further volatility.BitMEX ETHUSD OI (Source: Skew)Which side will this volatility favor?As reported by CryptoSlate yesterday, a simple ascending triangle that Ethereum recently established and confirmed may allow it to climb towards $200 in the near-term, with this pattern being highly bullish.Related: Analyst: this simple Ethereum structure point towards a quick recovery to $200Furthermore, $200 is also where there is significant resistance and liquidity, making this an ideal region for long ETH traders who may be looking to exit their positions.Although Ethereum may remain closely correlated to Bitcoin, its outperformance of the benchmark cryptocurrency may give it room to run significantly further if BTC is able to continue inching higher.The massive increase in trader activity – per ETH’s rising open interest and futures volume – may also work to fan the flames currently fueling its uptrend.

102,CryptoSlate,"Cardano (ADA) product managers say ITN a huge success, Byron reboot will solve major problems",Priyeshu Garg,1586146740.0,"IOHK’s product managers have said that the Shelley Incentivized Testnet (ITN) has been a huge success, with over 1000 stake pools created and 38 percent of the ada (ADA) supply delegated. The recently implemented Byron reboot has laid the foundation for the mainnet deployment of Shelley, as it will help solve the problems with the network’s performance and reliability.ITN exceeds all expectationsLast week, the product management team of IOHK gave the first of their many scheduled monthly updates on the current progress of Cardano. The update, part of IOHK’s larger effort to bring more transparency to the process of developing the network, went over the latest changes brought on by IOHK and the impact they will have on future adjustments.Related: IOHK to focus on educating the world about Cardano in 2020Aparna Jue, the product director of Cardano, said that the Shelley Incentivized Testnet (ITN) was a great showcase of a community-based feedback loop. The product managers, Jue explained, use the feedback and engagement they get to answer important questions regarding the development of the network.Dynal Patel, the product manager of the ITN, said that the testnet exceeded everyone’s expectations with over 1000 stake pools on chain with 17,000 people delegating 38 percent of the entire ADA supply.However, that isn’t to say that there aren’t things to improve. Patel said that stake pool operators wanted an economic model that made sense for them, as well as all of the information regarding the testnet gathered in one place. Apart from that, IOHK was also looking into introducing communications methods between stake pool operators, ways to promote individual stake pools, and stopping bad behavior on the network.Byron reboot paves the way for Shelley launchAll of the work currently being done on the ITN will pave the way for the Shelley mainnet release. However, none of it would be possible were it not for the Byron reboot, which has set the foundation for the release of Cardano’s staking era.According to Jue, Byron, the current era Cardano is in, is the innermost layer of Cardano based on fundamentals, performance reliability, and sync times. The reboot, which introduced a better, evidence-based technology model, is crucial for Shelley because around 80 percent of its code is actually Byron code.Jue said that properties-based testing for Shelley has already been done, with the next level being integration testing and quality assurance. Once all of the Shelley features are systematically tested, IOHK will open the testnet up to the world and allow general users to come and try it out.Within the next few weeks, IOHK will begin reaching out to certain key stakeholders and pool operators to begin testing out the network while simultaneously releasing documentation. The company is also working on the pre-release version of a Daedalus wallet for the ITN, Daedalus flight, which will allow users to give feedback to developers.Rob Cohen, the product manager for Hydra, Cardano’s scalability protocol, said Ouroboros Praos will be introduced on the Shelley mainnet. The new Cardano node will allow decentralization, provide better security assumptions, and offer complete scalability.

103,CryptoSlate,This stunning trend amongst crypto exchange tokens may be a massive red flag for investors,Cole Petersen,1585889100.0,"Native platform tokens aimed at increasing the efficiency and decreasing the costs associated with interacting with crypto exchanges have garnered significant popularity amongst investors in recent times, with their overt utility boosting transaction volumes and making them attractive to investors.In spite of this, data regarding the concentration of these tokens amongst so-called “whales” is quite alarming, signaling that these tokens may be highly prone to seeing manipulation.It also damages the investment proposition that these tokens possess, as it makes it highly unclear as to whether or not their growth is organic or artificial.Crypto exchange tokens garner massive popularityExchange tokens are a relatively new class of digital assets that have gained immense popularity and have drawn billions of dollars’ worth of investors’ capital throughout the past few years.Currently, some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are platform-specific tokens.Binance Coin (BNB) has seen significant growth throughout the past couple of years, with its market cap ballooning from $10 million in mid-2017 to highs of nearly $5.5 billion in mid-2019, before declining slightly to its current size of over $2 billion.UNUS SED LEO – the token associated with Bitfinex – rapidly gaining an over $1 billion market cap after launching in the summer of 2019.A handful of other exchange cryptos occupy positions amongst the largest cryptocurrencies, with Huobi Token, Crypto.com Coin, OKB, and FTX Token all having significant popularity amongst investors.Exchange token’s whale concentrations a massive red flag for investorsAccording to data from the on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, many of these tokens have striking whale concentrations.The data shows that UNUS SED LEO has a 99 percent whale concentration, suggesting that the exchange itself and possibly a handful of individuals hold massive sway over the cryptocurrency.A similar trend is seen while looking towards Huobi Token, Crypto.com Token, and FTX Token, which have whale concentrations at 93 percent, 90 percent, and 96 percent respectively.This is compared to that seen amongst decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which is only at a mere 1 percent.This is a major red flag for investors treating these tokens as investments, as it suggests that they may be highly prone to seeing manipulate movements and inorganic growth.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

104,CryptoSlate,"Bitcoin was one of the worst performers in Q1, but these altcoins astonished",Ali Martinez,1585806240.0,"Despite the state of commotion in the global financial markets, several altcoins were able to provide significant gains during the first quarter of the year.Bitcoin: the worst performer in Q1In a recent report, Binance Research affirmed that Bitcoin displayed a negative performance throughout the first quarter of the present year. Although the flagship cryptocurrency surged more than 50 percent between January and mid-February, the recent downturn in the market was able to erase all gains made.Indeed, BTC plunged from a high of $10,500 to hit a low of $4,000 on March 13. This price level has not been seen since over a year.The significant correction that the pioneer cryptocurrency suffered made it one of the worst performers amongst the top digital assets by market capitalization, according to the research arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume Binance.Ethereum, on the other hand, ended the first quarter of 2020 in the green providing a quarterly return slightly over 3 percent while other altcoins showed significant gains.Quarterly returns in Q1 2020 by Binance ResearchAltcoins in the greenBinance Research explained that Bitcoin SV, UNUS SED LEO, Chainlink, and Tezos were able to perform positively during Q1 due to “idiosyncratic factors” including important news, mainnet launch, forks, and others. These altcoins displayed quarterly returns of 70 percent, 29 percent, 28.6 percent, and 20 percent, respectively.The gains that BSV, LEO, LINK, and XTZ  provided were quite surprising for many market participants since the global pandemic and fissures within OPEC were able to pulverize the global financial markets. The S&P 500, for instance, fell over 35 percent in March displaying a negative quarterly return of 19 percent.Now that a new quarter began, data from Skew reveals that historically Q2 has been a great month for the bulls. The crypto derivatives data analytics firm maintains that in the past six years, with the exception of 2018, Bitcoin has surged by nearly 80 percent on average from April to June.Bitcoin Quarterly Returns by SkewEven though the cryptocurrency market has never gone through a global economic slowdown, this quarter will certainly demonstrate whether this new asset class is able to decouple from traditional markets and provide hedging opportunities.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis, Derivatives     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

124,CryptoSlate,This “amoral” crypto intends to allow users to profit from Coronavirus deaths,Cole Petersen,1582945200.0,"The rapid spread of the Coronavirus has sent shockwaves across the globe, sparking tremendous fear and leading the global equities markets, commodities, and even the crypto markets to see incredibly intense selloffs.Some prominent analysts have noted that the ongoing global selloff comes as investors flee from risk-prone assets in favor of cash.Now, one small ERC-20 token is looking to allow investors to profit from the rapid spread – and subsequent destruction – of the COVID-19, leading many spectators to question the morality of this initiative.Coronavirus sees massive spread as WHO upgrades global risk levelThe Coronavirus has been seeing an intense rate of growth over the past several days and weeks, now being found across 29 countries.The rapid spread of the virus out of its country of origin – China – has led many to claim that it is only a matter of time before it morphs into a full-blown pandemic via community-based spreading – something that is already being seen in California.The World Health Organization has now upgraded their global impact assessment of the virus to “very high.”WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke about this in a Friday morning briefing, saying:“We have now increased our assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at a global level.”This has sent chills down the spines of investors, with global stock indices, the aggregated crypto market, and even some so-called “safe haven investments” like gold and other precious metals all plummeting.This crypto wants to allow investors to profit from COVID-19’s destructionIn a recent post on Reddit, the recent release of an ERC20-compliant token dubbed CoronaCoin is detailed, explaining that investors can now “bet on the coronavirus pandemic by investing on CoronaCoin, the more the virus spreads the more valuable the token becomes.”The token supply will be burned based on the total number of COVID-19 related deaths and infections, thus inflating CoronaCoin’s value.This idea hasn’t been met with great enthusiasm from investors, however, as many respondents on the post called the concept “disgusting” and “tasteless,” with one user going as far to call it “amoral.”Conceptually, this notion of attempting to profit from virus-related death and destruction is quite morbid, making it unlikely that this token will be met with any significant utilization and adoption going forward.Posted In: Altcoins, Coronavirus     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

125,CryptoSlate,IOHK to focus on educating the world about Cardano in 2020,Priyeshu Garg,1582973640.0,"IOHK, the company behind the Cardano blockchain, has announced that it will begin prioritizing education this year. The company laid out an extensive plan for 2020 that will see more education materials, lectures, and courses published in order to bridge the gap between the company’s academic papers and mainstream understanding of Cardano.IOHK makes education its primary goalWhile Cardano, an ambitious blockchain created by IOHK, has been one of the most heavily-researched projects in the crypto industry, the company has struggled with both communication and adoption.As part of the company’s overall strategy, IOHK has already started working on improving transparency by publishing weekly and monthly reports on the developments within Cardano. To speed up the process, the company has now announced that it will also work on broadening its educational materials in order to help its community better understand the project.“The IOHK education team will be investing significant time and effort this year in broadening our range of materials.”The company said it will develop “a variety of learning and training assets” which will be aimed both at the Cardano community and Cardano developers. A part of the educational efforts will also be aimed at enterprises, IOHK said, adding that it was important to inform decision-makers about the problems that can be solved by Cardano.Focusing on programming languagesSeveral lectures about IOHK’s smart contract programming languages, Plutus and Marlowe, have already been held at the University of Malta. The lectures are set to be used as a foundation for more modular training materials in the coming months.IOHK’s efforts to educate users on its programming languages have turned out to be very popular—the company said that over 5,000 users have signed up for their free Udemy courses on Plutus and Marlowe. The popularity of these courses pushed the company to work on the second edition of its Plutus ebook, which will most likely be published later this year.Additional content on Cardano’s proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol Ouroboros is also in the works, as is a massive open online course (MOOC) on its programming language, Haskell.Online courses aren’t the only thing the company will be focusing on—IOHK said that comprehensive classroom-based courses on Haskell and Plutus were also being planned in Mongolia. A series of training workshops that will take place around the world have also been announced, with the first one taking place in Quebec in the spring.To facilitate a more productive environment within the company, IOHK began working on creating a new learning portal for its internal teams. The in-house educational resource, called the IOHK Training Academy, will make onboarding new employees much more streamlined. This, the company said, will be a vital resource for its staff spread across 43 different countries.Posted In: Cardano, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

126,CryptoSlate,XRP enters heavy support region as analysts eye a major bounce,Cole Petersen,1582874760.0,"XRP has seen some intense losses over the past week, with the cryptocurrency sliding from highs within the mid-$0.30 region into the lower-$0.20, erasing the bulk of the gains it incurred as a result of its intense 2020 uptrend.This recent selloff, however, may not be long-lasting, as analysts are noting that the crypto could still be poised to see significantly further near-term upside due to the heavy support around its current price levels.It still remains unclear whether or not this potential bounce will be able to occur in spite of the aggregated market’s intense bearishness, as it may require Bitcoin to also see some upward momentum.Crypto market sees capitulatory selloff, sending XRP and other altcoins reeling lowerBitcoin and the aggregated crypto market have been caught within a firm downtrend since last Wednesday, which was when the benchmark cryptocurrency saw a rare “flash crash” that sent its price reeling down by $1,000 in a matter of minutes.This movement marked one of the largest single-hour price declines the cryptocurrency has seen and instantly sent shockwaves throughout the markets.In tandem, XRP and many other altcoins saw selloffs of 10 percent or more, and despite the sharp recovery that occurred shortly after this, the markets have been drifting lower in the time since.It now appears that most major cryptos have formed an incredibly close correlation to Bitcoin’s price movements, slightly underperforming it during selloffs and marginally outperforming it during bounces.If XRP wants to recover some of its recent losses, it likely hinges on whether or not BTC is able to find some stability or begin climbing higher.This strong support region may bolster the embattled cryptocurrencyEven if Bitcoin does enter a prolonged bout of sideways trading or inches lower in the near-term, it is possible that XRP will be able to incur some short-term momentum due to heavy support that exists around its current price levels.Crypto Micahël, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst and trader, spoke about this support in a recent tweet, explaining that he believes it could help the cryptocurrency rally up towards $0.30 if bulls are able to recapture $0.245.“The USDT pair is in a support area here. Reclaiming $0.245 and we’ve got space back towards $0.28-0.30.

127,CryptoSlate,"Ethereum bulls defend key support, but analysts still think the top is in",Cole Petersen,1582702020.0,"It has been a rocky few days for the crypto markets, with Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and most major altcoins incurring intense selloffs that have led them to erase a significant amount of the gains they incurred throughout the past couple of months.Ethereum has been particularly impacted by this recent downtrend, which comes as the result of bulls’ inability to sustain the parabolic rally it incurred earlier this month.Analysts are now noting that the cryptocurrency could be positioned for some further near-term downside, but it may first see a relief rally.Ethereum plummets nearly 10% as bulls defend key short-term support levelAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading down just under 10 percent at its current price of $228, which marks a notable decline from daily highs of over $250.ETH’s ongoing downtrend first began earlier this month when its parabolic rally ended at roughly $290.The fact that bulls were unable to sustain the crypto’s intense upwards momentum that occurred against a backdrop of market-wide bullishness was a warning sign that pointed to some underlying weakness.Currently, analysts are noting that ETH’s buyers are currently in the process of defending a key short-term support level that it is trading just a hair above, and the support here could be enough to allow it to climb slightly higher in the hours ahead.Crypto Michaël – a popular crypto trader who was previously a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange – pointed to a chart in a recent tweet that elucidates that he anticipates a bounce at this level to lead ETH to climb roughly 20% against its BTC trading pair.“Interesting level we’re bouncing from here.”Image Courtesy of Crypto MichaëlAnalyst: the mid-term ETH top is already inAlthough it is possible that ETH sees a slight bounce from its current price levels, it does appear that its mid-term top is in.AMD Traders – another well-respected crypto trader – explained that he believes ETH has topped out and is starting a “complex correction.”“Support here isn’t anything too significant, but we could see a bounce soon. I do think ETH did top out and this is the start of a complex correction. I also don’t think the low is in for Ethereum, just so you know what my HTF bias is. Doesn’t mean I won’t trade the long side,” he said.Image Courtesy of AMD TradesUnless Bitcoin begins incurring some upwards momentum that leads the aggregated market higher, it does appear to be a strong possibility that Ethereum and other major altcoins are in for further near-term losses.

128,CryptoSlate,XRP plummets to $0.24 as analysts watch for capitulatory move to 2020 lows,Cole Petersen,1582715760.0,"XRP, like many other major altcoins, has caught the brunt of Bitcoin’s recent downturn, with the embattled crypto plummeting from its recent highs of $0.35 all the way down to its current price of under $0.25.This intense selloff has led to a degradation of nearly all the technical strength that had come about as a result of its recent rally, and it now appears to be at risk of seeing a further near-term downside.Multiple top analysts have shared their thoughts on XRP, noting that the crypto could soon revisit its year-to-date lows, as this may be where it has enough buying pressure to halt its ongoing downtrend.XRP sees intense selloff as Bitcoin begins moving towards key support at $9,000The past few days have been rough for the aggregated cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin’s recent rejection at $10,000 sparking a selloff that appears to have reached a boiling point tonight as BTC moves towards $9,000.This movement has led to chaos amongst altcoins, with virtually all major cryptos shedding over 5 percent of their value over the past 24-hours, while many post losses of 10 percent or more.XRP is no exception to this, as it is currently trading down over 8 percent at its current price of $0.248, which marks a massive decline from daily highs of over $0.27.Calmly, a cryptocurrency trader on Twitter, spoke about XRP in a recent tweet, explaining that it doesn’t have any notable support until roughly $0.21, meaning that it could see significantly further near-term losses.“Ripple – I am current expecting us to go at least as low as $0.213 on XRP, but I think there are a few trades to take until then. Looking to see if we can build support at $0.235 for a scalp long.”Image Courtesy of CalmlyImmense bearishness could lead the token to its yearly lowsAlthough Calmly believes that XRP may be able to find enough buying pressure to halt its downtrend around $0.21, other analysts are eyeing a revisit to its yearly lows against its BTC trading pair.TraderXO, another well-respected crypto trader and analyst, spoke about this in a tweet, telling his followers that he anticipated XRP to severely underperform Bitcoin in the near-term.“XRP update: Close below yearly open – then it’s quite possible this might go for the lows before a spring back up – and possibly play out a wyckoff accumulation 1 – scenario. Hold the yearly – and I’ll start building.”Image Courtesy of TraderXOUnless Bitcoin posts a swift rally that leads it to recapture its previous position above $10,000, it is highly likely that altcoins like XRP will see significantly further near-term losses before finding any notable support.

129,CryptoSlate,Crypto market sees extensive bloodbath as Bitcoin reaches key level,Cole Petersen,1582621500.0,"After a futile attempt to kick off another uptrend yesterday, the crypto market has seen an intense selloff that has stemmed from Bitcoin’s move down to $9,500, which has subsequently led most major altcoins to plummet lower.This bloodbath has led most major cryptocurrencies to form an incredibly close correlation to Bitcoin, and it is highly probable that where the aggregated market heads next will be dependent on whether or not BTC is able to hold above a key level that it is currently trading at.If the benchmark crypto breaks below this level, it could spark a market-wide selloff that leads many major altcoins to invalidate the bullish market structures they have formed over the past several weeks.Crypto market sees intense selloff following Bitcoin’s bearish rejection Yesterday, Bitcoin attempted to make a move up to $10,000 that was met with significant selling pressure, subsequently leading BTC to plummet towards $9,500.This rejection sent shockwaves throughout the aggregated crypto market, with many altcoins that were previously expressing bullishness to see notable selloffs.At the time of writing, Tezos and Chainlink – two of the best performing altcoins in 2020–are leading today’s drop, trading down 8 percent and 7.5 percent respectively.Most other altcoins are closely trailing these losses, with Litecoin, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, and others all trading down roughly 6 percent.The only major cryptocurrency that has been able to dodge losses of this magnitude is Ethereum, which is trading down just under 3 percent.Where altcoins go next depends on how Bitcoin reacts to one key levelToday’s selloff has led Bitcoin to a key support level at $9,550 that bulls are currently attempting to defend, and a drop below this level could open the gates for significantly further near-term losses.Big Chonis, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, spoke about this key level in a recent tweet, referencing the level seen on the below chart.“Very important area that Bitcoin bulls want to hold…Has acted as support to resistance and back to support… weekly!”Bitcoin Trading Levels.  Courtesy of Big ChonisIn the near-term, how deep the ongoing altcoin selloff extends will likely rest largely on whether BTC is able to further extend its upwards momentum, as a failure to do so will likely lead investors to flee their altcoin positions in favor of BTC.

130,CryptoSlate,"An “OG” Bitcoin holder shilled an altcoin a conference, and nobody is all too pleased",Nick Chong,1582615980.0,"Last weekend, some of the world’s most outspoken Bitcoin proponents and analysts descended on Las Vegas. The reason: Tone Vays, the Wall Streeter-turned-cryptocurrency analyst was hosting a “Bitcoin not blockchain” conference and a “celebrity” poker tournament in a weekend he dubbed “Unconfiscatable,” a reference to the decentralized nature of BTC.The list of attendees was stacked: Vays himself, programmer Jimmy Song, Adaptive Capital’s Willy Woo, outspoken libertarian Max Keiser, content creator Peter McCormack, and many others.The list also included Trace Mayer, a somewhat elusive figure in Bitcoin circles, seemingly appearing at few conferences compared to his counterparts on the list.Mayer is a long-time investor, having shilled the cryptocurrency via his online platforms when the asset was under $5, before 2012. He is also a “HODLer of Last Resort,” BTC owners that purport to never sell their coins. Like never.Because of his commitment, many were excited to see him, including American HODL, a pseudonymous commentator that has been blocked on Twitter multiple times for his antics whose entire persona is built on, well, HODLing Bitcoin.Unfortunately, attendees purport that Mayer isn’t what they expected, and they aren’t too pleased because of that.Drop Bitcoin, buy MimbleWimble Coin?In the wake of Unconfiscatable, American HODL, who has since restarted his Twitter account (and thus the relevant tweet was deleted), was languishing on Twitter.Through a very direct tweet, he said that after talking with Trace Mayer for an hour, he had lost faith in the individual, claiming that Mayer “was” his hero and idol. The reason: Mayer was going around at the conference purportedly promoting some altcoin called Mimblewimble Coin (MWC). The commentator elaborated:“He spent that hour shilling me mimblewimblecoin [sic]. To say I’m disappointed would be an understatement.”According to Giacomo Zucco, a prominent Bitcoin maximalist who was also in attendance at the event, the shilling also took the form of the below piece of fortune cookie fortune-esque paper.Many were immediately taken aback by the contents of the message, which touted MWC as “Good money” and a profitable altcoin that is up “100x in BTC [terms] in two months.” Zucco himself wrote:“People spend effort, time & money to organize educational events about Bitcoin, while having a good laugh at shitcoin scams. Then somebody takes advantage of all that effort to distribute promotion codes for his own pump&dump scam.”Many prominent names in the Bitcoin space shared and bumped Zucco’s tweet, including individuals like Hodlonaut, Stephan Livera, Mr. Hodl, and others. Others included their own commentary on the situation, making comments on how it’s important not to have heroes in Bitcoin, why the concept of trust is so relevant to cryptocurrency, and so on.It isn’t clear exactly how Mayer distributed the above message, though some have joked that he might have been passing them out as if they were contraband, subtly slipping the paper into the hands of people he talked to.And importantly, it appears that the tweets from Zucco and American HODL aren’t a concerted attempt to slander Mayer’s character or person either. Seven minutes into the below Youtube video in which the long-time Bitcoin owner is interviewed, Mimblewimble Coin is mentioned.What the hell is Mimblewimble Coin?This may leave you wondering, what is MWC?MWC, which was literally just listed on CoinMarketCap on Feb. 23, is an extremely new crypto project that leverages the technology it’s named after, Mimblewimble, and others to improve scalability and privacy. As an excerpt from the project’s site reads:“MWC is a scarce pure proof of work Mimblewimble based coin that enables greater network scalability, privacy and fungibility than legacy blockchain protocols. All transactions on the base layer use Greg Maxwell’s Coin Join with his Confidential Transactions and signature aggregation. MWC is the technologically superior ghost money.”It isn’t exactly clear who is behind the project.What happens in Vegas, uh, doesn’t stay in VegasAs it stands, Mayer has yet to respond to the recent criticism he has faced from many corners in the Bitcoin community; his Twitter account remains silent, with its last post being published on February 18th.Unfortunately, it seems that the age-old tagline “What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas” didn’t seem to apply to the going-ons of Unconfiscatable, an event focused on discussing the censorship-resistant Bitcoin.How fitting. How fitting.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, People, Privacy, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

131,CryptoSlate,Analyst: Ethereum may see intense rally after piercing this technical resistance,Cole Petersen,1582278180.0,"Ethereum (ETH) has seen some mixed price action over the past week, with the cryptocurrency previously finding some stability around $280 before plummeting below $250 in tandem with Bitcoin’s crash below $10,000.In the time since this violent movement occurred, however, ETH’s bulls have been able to regain their strength, and they have been subsequently pushing the cryptocurrency higher.Importantly, ETH’s recovery from its recent selloff has allowed it to break above a critical technical resistance formation that was previously suppressing its price, with this development suggesting it could soon rally significantly further.Ethereum moves higher as the aggregated crypto market recovers from weekly lowsAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading up just under 5 percent at its current price of $267, which marks a notable climb from its multi-day lows of under $250.The tempered uptrend that ETH has experienced in the time following its recent flash crash has also allowed it to outperform Bitcoin, as it is currently trading up 3.5 percent against its BTC trading pair.In order for Ethereum to once again find itself caught within a tailwind that sends it past $300, it is imperative that the cryptocurrency is able to once again regain its position within the $280 region.One factor that could suggest a move back up to this region is imminent is the possibility that it is currently trading within a wide bull flag, with its recent bounce at roughly $250 marking a defense of the lower boundary of this bullish formation.The Crypto Dog, an incredibly popular cryptocurrency analyst and commentator, recently shared a chart showing this formation, questioning whether it is worth going long on Ethereum based on this pattern.Image Courtesy of The Crypto DogETH highly bullish after moving above weekly Ichimoku cloudThe potential bull flag ETH is caught within isn’t the only factor counting in bulls favor, as the cryptocurrency has also been able to pierce its weekly Ichimoku cloud, which is a highly bullish mid-term development.CryptoWolf – another popular crypto trader – spoke about this in a recent tweet, pointing to a chart showing the latest development.“ETH trading above the weekly Ichimoku cloud. God bless Vitalik.”Image Courtesy of CryptoWolfIn order for this bull-favoring development to be confirmed, it is imperative that bulls are able to hold the crypto above this level until its weekly candle closes this Sunday.

132,CryptoSlate,Cardano-parent IOHK says the Ouroboros BFT is ready to be deployed,Priyeshu Garg,1582168440.0,"IOHK, the company behind Cardano, announced that it will be updating its Ouroboros, its proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, from the Byron mainnet to the Ouroboros BFT. The update has been successfully tested and will be deployed on Feb. 20. ADA holders and users of the Shelley Incentivized Testnet will experience no changes during the update, the company said.Ouroboros ready to be deployed on the Byron mainnetIn a culmination of more than a year of work, IOHK has announced that its advanced proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol Ouroboros is ready to be deployed. The protocol, which will act as a bridge between Cardano’s Byron and Shelley eras, is set to be updated to Ouroboros BFT.According to a video update from Tim Harrison, the director of communications at IOHK, the company has successfully tested Ouroboros on the Byron testnet. It will be deployed on Feb. 20, on epoch 176, Harrison said. Epochs are periods of time in the Cardano blockchain in which the network knows in advance who will have the right to generate a new block. Epochs are divided into multiple slots, each one about 20 seconds long.He noted that those holding ADA will not have to do anything to prepare for the update, as it will happen behind the scenes. Users currently participating in the Shelley Incentivized Testnet, as well as users holding their funds on the Yoroi and Daedalus wallets also won’t be affected by the update.“So this is a really positive next step in the development of the Cardano platform, but it’s also something that’s happening very much behind the scenes,” Harrison said in a YouTube video.Bridging the gap between Byron and Shelley erasThe Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocol update is an important step both for IOHK and the Cardano network. The update will help the company transition the Cardano blockchain from the Ouroboros Classic consensus protocol, which is currently being used on the Byron mainnet, to the Ouroboros Genesis—a protocol that will power the Shelley mainnet once it’s launched.Harrison called Ouroboros BFT a “stepping stone in compatibility” that will enable the evolution of Cardano. It will transition the blockchain from it’s federated Byron era to the decentralized, proof-of-stake network that Shelley will bring.While the company refers to the update as a “hard fork,” it’s actually a protocol update that has been planned and managed all the way back in Cardano’s whitepaper.Harrison’s video update is also worth mentioning in itself, as it shows that IOHK has kept its promise when it comes to improving communication with its community. The company is currently putting a lot of effort into both marketing and PR in order to promote the massive developments happening on the Cardano network.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

133,CryptoSlate,Korean crypto company Contents Protocol to shut down and refund 27000 ETH,Priyeshu Garg,1582107960.0,"Contents Protocol, a Korean crypto startup focused on content exchange, announced that it will shut down due to a lack of business prospects and regulatory uncertainties. In a rare bout of professionalism and solidarity, the company will be refunding their investors, distributing just under 27,000 ETH on a pro-rata basis.Korean content exchange protocol shutting down after 14 monthsA Korean company behind the premium decentralized content exchange Contents Protocol has announced that it will be shutting down. The young startup, which raised $10 million in ETH in its December 2018 token sale, has been around less than 14 months.The project was created to collect consumer data from Korean content platforms such as WATCHA and WATCHA PLAY in order to create a better content production ecosystem. The company rewarded the platforms and their users for the collected data with its native cryptocurrency, the Contents Protocol token (CPT), which would later be processed to be sold to other content providers.However, the company’s ambitious idea hit a brick wall shortly after its ICO ended as it became increasingly hard to encourage participation from content consumers. Contents Protocol said that the negative perception toward cryptocurrency, price volatility, and complicated user experience were the biggest problems it faced.“In order to overcome these limitations, the team went through numerous trials and errors, but after serious deliberation, we decided that it would be best to put a stop to this business and return our remaining assets to CPT holders,” the company said in the announcement.Rarely a crypto company willingly refunds investorsAfter advising with law firms from both Korea and Singapore, the company decided that all of itsremaining assets will be distributed to its users. The company raised a total of 29,333.77 ETH through the ICO and currently has 26,877.68 ETH available for distribution. As the current circulating supply of CPT is just under 3.2 billion tokens, investors will get around 0.84 ETH for 100,000 CPT.Table showing the asset distribution ratio for Contents Protocol’s funds. (Source: Contents Protocol)“We will convert our remaining assets to ETH and distribute it on a pro-rata basis to CPT holders who have requested ETH compensation until a specified date.”The company is set to go through a liquidation process and all the CPT it currently owns and collects through the process will be destroyed.And while Contents Protocol isn’t the first, nor will it be the last company to shut down after the ICO book, the startup made the news due to its decision to refund investors—willingly.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far ordered multiple companies to refund investors for selling unregulated cryptocurrencies via ICOs. Back in 2018, Pantera Capital Management estimated that a quarter of the ICOs it invested in could be forced to refund their backers.Posted In: Ethereum, Korea, Altcoins, Regulation     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

135,CryptoSlate,"Why TRON, XRP, and Cardano (ADA) just plunged 12% in a severe altcoin correction",Joseph Young,1581939480.0,"Major alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) including TRON, XRP, and Cardano (ADA) dropped by more than 12 percent against the USD on the day. The move follows a strong 50 to 90 percent upsurge within a span of two months.A big upsurge is often supplemented with a big correctionIn the past two weeks, while the Bitcoin price increased by 14 percent, TRON, XRP, and Cardano surged by around 30 percent on average.As the Bitcoin price reclaimed $10,000, which is widely considered to be a psychological level by traders, the cryptocurrency market started to rebound. Traders started to become more confident in the bullish market structure, taking the market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market from $256 billion to $307 billion in about ten days.The market quickly became overbought, leading most technical indicators like the relative strength index (RSI) and other momentum oscillators to show signs of an imminent pullback.In an upward trend, altcoins tend to front-run bitcoin and surge faster than the dominant cryptocurrency. In the latest bull trend, for instance, the price of Ethereum started to rise first with bitcoin following the price trend of Ethereum.During a bearish trend or a pullback, altcoins tend to depend on bitcoin for short-term price movements.Although the bitcoin price briefly surged past $10,000 on the day immediately after the opening of the CME bitcoin futures market, it demonstrated a steep sell-off right after it. Consequently, altcoins like XRP, TRON, and Cardano pulled back, recording significant volatility in a short period.Josh Rager, a cryptocurrency technical analyst, said that after the daily close earlier today, the bitcoin price was at a crucial support level at $9,800.As Bitcoin struggled to hold $9,800 and corrected to the $9,600s, even major altcoins with relatively high liquidity in the likes of XRP plummeted with little to no reaction from buyers.Rager noted:“Bullish – nice 4 hr & daily close to end Sunday, bounced at key area of $9800 (HVN). Bearish – still forming lower highs/lower lows on intraday charts, CME price pullback from $10,075. less premium Still needs to hold $9800+ on HTF or we’ll still visit $9,300 to $9,550.”Bitcoin briefly rejected the $9,800 support level, causing altcoins like XRP to plunge (source: Josh Rager Twitter)If the Bitcoin price rebounds in the short-term, altcoins are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of it.Why altcoins like XRP fell so hardHowever, due to extremely high funding rates, XRP fell by 22 percent within 24 hours, causing havoc in the market.A funding rate on margin trading platforms like BitMEX and Binance Futures refers to a system that lets long holders or short sellers pay each other based on the state of the market.If there are more longs in the market, long holders need to pay short-sellers a certain percentage of their position every eight hours to bring balance in the market. In the case of XRP and Ethereum, funding rates exceed 0.1 percent, which means long holders need to pay short-sellers a significant amount of money to leave their positions open.That places pressure on long holders to adjust or close their positions, causing a deeper correction in the market.Posted In: Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

The last time we did represented the only true dip from $180 – $150.”Image Courtesy of Cold Blooded ShillerIf this crossover does occur, then it is likely that Ethereum’s intense 2020 uptrend could see its first notable retrace, although it remains unclear as to whether or not this will fundamentally alter its bullish market structure.

139,CryptoSlate,Charles Hoskinson thinks a Cardano-powered stablecoin will “blow everyone out of the water”,Priyeshu Garg,1581552000.0,"The possibility of launching a stablecoin on the Cardano network has gone from rumor to major news, as Charles Hoskinson said that it would increase demand for ADA. The CEO of IOHK said that the company has been “thinking about stablecoins” for the past seven years and seems to be seriously considering it.Charles Hoskinson expresses interest in launching a stablecoin on CardanoA new stablecoin could be introduced to the crypto market, and it might just be launched on the Cardano network. Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, the company behind Cardano, expressed interest in hosting a stablecoin on Cardano’s blockchain in a recent tweet, saying that both he and the company have been considering the idea for years. Hoskinson said:“If we do this, then it will blow everyone out of the water. I started in this space with stablecoins and we’ve been thinking about them for seven years.”The talk about a Cardano-based stablecoin began with a tweet from Weiss Crypto Ratings, a ratings and analytics company focused on cryptocurrencies. On Feb. 11, the company said that there were rumors that Hoskinson was looking to build a version of DAI stablecoin on Cardano.The company noted that there is a need for more trustless stablecoins in the crypto market, as coins like DAI have no trusted point of failure. This, the tweet said, gives it a huge advantage over other stablecoins such as USDT and USDC.Having a stablecoin on Cardano would increase demand for ADALaunching a version of DAI on Cardano spread like wildfire on Twitter, with the news making headlines on most crypto media. The hype surrounding stablecoins and Cardano had an even harder time calming down when Hoskinson addressed the issue again, explaining that such a project could have huge benefits both for Cardano as a network and for ADA holders.The Cardano Report, a Cardano-focused news outlet, asked Hoskinson how such a project would benefit ADA holders, as it was unclear whether the project would be separate from Cardano.Hoskinson said that the prospective stablecoin that gets launched on Cardano could use its native cryptocurrency, ADA, as part of its Central Bank mechanism. This, he explained, would create more demand for the underlying asset, increasing both ADA’s price and its use-cases.

Aside from a few isolated consolidations, almost every coin on the market has seen its price skyrocket and its trading volume soar since the new year began.And while many expected this to be the year when Bitcoin finally enters a bull rally that will put its 2017 boom to shame, the world’s largest cryptocurrency still has a long way to go. While the market did come out of the crypto winter, it seems to have entered the alt season instead of the much-awaited Bitcoin spring.According to the latest State of the Network report from Coin Metrics, most cryptocurrencies have continued their hot start to 2020 into last week. But, while Bitcoin led the way in 2019, we have now seen many smaller-cap altcoins outperform it. The report said:“Market breadth is quite positive with nearly all assets in our coverage universe holding onto strong weekly gains.”Ethereum outpaced Bitcoin both in returns and in user growth. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency posted five days of consecutive positive returns from Feb. 5 to Feb. 9, a pattern that has happened only 21 times in its history. Its active addresses grew by 21.5 percent, while its transaction count grew by more than 12 percent last week, Coin Metrics reported.Altcoins and stablecoins lead the way in the first week of FebruaryIt’s not only the altcoins that have seen major growth this year.

The promotional campaigns surrounding this token brought it to the forefront of the industry, subsequently building some support from neophyte crypto investors.In spite of having backing from a small handful of popular industry figures, a recent announcement from a HEX team member seems to confirm the wide-held theory that it is an alleged exit scam.HEX website is brimming with red flags, signaling something is amiss  HEX, which is advertised on its website as the “first high-interest blockchain certificate of deposit,” encourages users to stake the token in order to watch their holdings “multiply.”On the token’s website, there are multiple glaring red flags that should have alerted investors that it wasn’t a legitimate project, including a prominently featured sub-heading that boasts that “HEX is designed to increase in value faster than anything else in history.”The shadiness doesn’t end here, however, as the site also uses words like “pumpamentals” to describe the cryptocurrency’s fundamental structure.While explaining how the token is able to provide users with “life-changing wealth,” it vaguely states that it uses a “computer science breakthrough to disrupt the largest markets in the world with a product of nearly infinite profit margin.”Surprise! A post from an employee seems to confirm it may be an exit scamAs CryptoSlate previously reported, there has been a myriad of evidence that HEX was an exit scam, including a report from January detailing $7 million worth of Ethereum had been withdrawn from an address associated with HEX.One analyst operating under the pseudonym “runbtc” posted a screenshot this evening showing what appears to be a statement from a HEX team member named “Paul” in which he says that he is removing HEX Tool from the app stores, as he believes there is evident manipulation of HEX’s market value.Image Courtesy of runbtcAlthough this is certainly not conclusive that the token is, in fact, an exit scam, it does confirm that insiders within the HEX ecosystem are beginning to jump ship due to ethical concerns.Posted In: Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

There isn’t much stopping it from retesting the highs at 4.79.”Image Courtesy of BagsyAnalysts concur: LINK is bound for a movement to $4.00Bagsy isn’t the only analyst that believes Chainlink could soon extend its bullishness until it breaks above $4.00.Satoshi Flipper, another prominent cryptocurrency analyst, explained in a recent tweet that Chainlink recently broke above the upper boundary of a bull flag that it had been caught within, leading him to believe that a rally to $4.00 is imminent.“That’s going to be a sweet 20% move to $4.”Image Courtesy of Satoshi FlipperBecause LINK has a history of making parabolic movements, it does appear to be highly likely that this ongoing surge will extend further, and its firm independent momentum could mean that it will move towards its previous highs regardless of how Bitcoin and the crypto markets trend.

144,CryptoSlate,Justin Sun’s $4.5M dinner with Warren Buffett had a massive ROI if you consider Tron’s price increase,Priyeshu Garg,1581046200.0,"The price of TRON‘s native cryptocurrency TRX surged over 10 percent in less than hour following the news about Justin Sun’s long-awaited dinner with Warren Buffett.TRX sees its price surge by 10 percent in half an hourOut of all the cryptocurrencies in the market today, few are as sensitive to media hype as Tron (TRX) is. The 12th largest coin by market capitalization, TRX has gathered a community that follows every rumor and hearsay with either a massive dump or a turbo-charged buying spree.The latter seemed to be the case earlier this week when the coin saw its price skyrocket after a month of slow and lagging growth.After struggling to break above $0.021 for over a week, Tron jumped to $0.023 in the early afternoon hours of Feb. 6. The coin managed to increase in value by 10 percent in half an hour, making it the single highest jump in the past six months.TRX Price chart. (Source: CryptoSlate TRX)The pump Tron has seen was fueled by news about Justin Sun‘s much-awaited lunch with Warren Buffet. Sun met with the legendary Berkshire Hathaway investor on Jan. 23 but shared information about the dinner they had on Feb. 6. According to Sun, Buffett is still skeptical about cryptocurrencies in general but saw great potential in blockchain technology.Sun’s $4.5 million-dinner was an incredible investment for TronDuring the dinner, Buffett became the owner of one Bitcoin and around $100,000 worth of TRX, which were gifted to him by Sun. The investor was reportedly impressed with the transaction speed on Tron but is yet to see real-life use cases for the new asset class.While Sun’s dinner with Buffett has been surrounded by controversy since last year, the outspoken entrepreneur certainly managed to make the most of it.

146,CryptoSlate,Charles Hoskinson says a lot is happening underneath the surface for Cardano (ADA),Priyeshu Garg,1580880600.0,"The effort to improve communication with the Cardano (ADA) community has revealed the scope of work and research that has gone into the platform. According to Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, the fruits of almost five years of labor will see the light of day in the next few months, marking the beginning of the end of IOHK’s involvement with the project.Hoskinson highlights the importance of third-party validationDespite the tough competition, there are few projects as unique as Cardano. The research-based blockchain project is one of the most ambitious ones on the market, as it aims not to disrupt, but to revolutionize.What makes Cardano unique is its use of peer review and formal methods. Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, the company building the blockchain, said that the project was started to see whether it was possible to “write code differently.” As opposed to writing a whitepaper and making that the basis for the code, IOHK decided to go back to basics and start with good, old-fashioned math.By using formal methods, a process of performing advanced mathematical analysis to software design, the company wanted to ensure that their final product will be as reliable and as robust as possible. However, the labor-intensive process came with a price.Hoskinson explained in his latest YouTube video:“When you write software like this it adds years to your roadmap”Five years, to be exact, as the project began all the way back in 2015. While major developments have been made towards the end of last year, it wasn’t until 2020 that the project really started taking off.The launch of the incentivized testnet for the Shelley era of Cardano was the most important milestone for the company in the past year or so, as it meant that most of the heavy lifting when it comes to infrastructure was almost done.However, the speed Cardano has picked up is a two-sided blade. Hoskinson said that once the Shelley Incentivized Testnet was released, people started to see Cardano only through its output and completely ignore the amount of work that has been going on beneath the surface.Five years of effort the teams behind Cardano have put in wouldn’t mean a thing if their product wasn’t good. While community participation is a good sign, third-party validation is the true measure of a product’s value. According to Hoskinson, the first security report for Cardano has just been released, and while it contains both the good and the bad parts of the code, it shows that everything was done correctly and with the product’s longevity in mind.Once all of the issues raised in the report have been resolved, a detailed report will be published, Hoskinson said.None of the scientific research that has gone into Cardano can substitute community engagementHoskinson said that he was extremely proud of what they achieved so far, saying that it was among the first, if not the first, company to build a pipeline that connected formal methods, peer-reviewed research, and practical testing. The years of research and development put in by the teams behind Cardano all led to the release of the incentivized testnet for Shelley.The outspoken CEO went on to explain why the testnet was so important for the development of Cardano. Hoskinson said that the point of introducing incentives into the testnet was to facilitate a broad discussion with the Cardano community about the experience of staking. By hearing the thoughts and concerns of the community, Cardano wanted to be able to better understand Ourbouros, its native staking protocol, and create the tools users and developers need.Hoskinson said that using Rust’s rapid prototyping approach enabled the company to accommodate the “experimental edge” of the newly created staking ecosystem.And the painstakingly thought-out approach has worked out. With more than 1000 registered staking pools and new ones being created almost every day, the incentivized testnet has exceeded all expectations. Hoskinson noted that while the company believed the testnet would be a success with a hundred stake pools, they doubted more than 50 would ever be created. The overwhelming participation and interest in the incentivized testnet showed that the company was on the right track, Hoskinson said.Investing in the community is a smart move for Cardano. The ultimate goal of IOHK is to relinquish all control over the project and leave it in the hands of its users, who will use its advanced governance system with improvement proposals and enhancement processes to run Cardano. This is the only way Cardano can be a truly decentralized blockchain and cryptocurrency, Hoskinson explained.Now that the science is almost done, Cardano is moving to the explanation phaseAfter the Shelley mainnet is released, the Cardano teams will push on right ahead with Goguen, the blockchain’s next iteration. While Shelley will decentralize the core of the blockchain by introducing staking, Goguen will enable users to create decentralized applications (dApps) on Cardano.Efforts to create and improve multi-asset management, identity, oracles, channels handling metadata that flows through transactions, development experiences, and Ethereum interoperability are all currently underway, Hoskinson said. He noted that all of the work that has been put into Shelley in the past few months has been going on in parallel to the work being done on Goguen.The company’s upcoming updates and releases show sudden pace Cardano has picked up didn’t come out of the blue.“These are the fruits of years of efforts,” Hoskinson said, adding that the sole focus for the next few months will be to deliver the products and updates they’ve been working on in the past year.One of the most important efforts the company has taken on was to improve its communication. Hoskinson admitted that neither IOHK nor its partners the Cardano Foundation and EMURGO have done that great of a job when it comes to community engagement. This, however, is no longer an issue.Hoskinson was very open about the company’s plans in the next few months. This month, the company will launch a Byron reboot code and begin the process of transitioning users from the Rust incentivized testnet to its Haskell version. The process, Hoskinson noted, will take between 3 and 4 weeks. February 20 will bring about the much-awaited Ouroboros BFT (Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerance) hard fork, while a major upgrade of Cardano Docs should also be completed by the end of the month.Once all of the Incentivized Testnet users have been transitioned to the Haskell product, the company will begin releasing updates related to its consumer side, which will, among other things, enable users to verify the balances they made in the testnet.Much of March and April will be spent on transitioning the Incentivized Testnet to work on Basho, the era of Cardano that will focus on scalability and interoperability of the network. New, original contributions to the Haskell code will be made in the meantime. Hoskinson explained that adding original code will help Cardano create the basis for securing “new partnerships,” but didn’t reveal whether or not the company had any concrete plans.He did say, however, that they were having “aggressive” conversations with partners and commercial organizations to create use cases and commercialize Cardano.“We really do have a shot at replacing the global payment and settlement systems with what we’ve accomplished with Cardano.”When it comes to plans for IOHK, Hoskinson stated that the latest developments with Cardano were bittersweet. The more Cardano looks like a finished product, the less stake IOHK will have in it.“This book is slowly coming to an end.”While there is still a long way to go and a lot of work to be done before IOHK can pack up their bags and leave, Hoskinson said that he hopes they have already laid the foundations for a system that will be sustainable and scalable even when left to its own devices.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

The consulting company is set to hold a workshop this month where they will present a strategy that will consolidate the works of Cardano, the Cardano Foundation, and Cardano’s venture arm Emurgo.The company’s ambitious plans for the coming months have created an incredibly strong bullish momentum for the Cardano community.The news about the partnership was enough to push the stagnating coin’s price by more than 15 percent in minutes and the buying pressure hasn’t eased one bit since then.

149,CryptoSlate,Ripple offloads nearly $200m in XRP; will this thwart its growing signs of bullishness?,Cole Petersen,1580778000.0,"XRP has seen some decent bullishness over the past several days, which has allowed the cryptocurrency to secure what appears to be a strong foothold within the mid-$0.20 region.This bullishness has come about in the face of turbulence within the aggregated crypto markets, with Bitcoin struggling to break through the intense resistance that exists between $9,500 and $9,600.Although XRP’s market structure appears to be highly bullish at the moment, it is important to note that Ripple – the San Francisco-based FinTech company with close ties to XRP – recently received nearly $200 million worth of tokens from their escrow account, meaning that the crypto may soon see a strong selloff.XRP’s technical situation grows bullish as it continues inching higherAt the time of writing, XRP is trading up just under one percent at its current price of $0.255, which marks a notable climb from its daily lows of roughly $0.24 that was set around this time yesterday.It is important to note that XRP has been outperforming Bitcoin over the past 24-hours, and the cryptocurrency appears to be shaping up to see significant further upside in the near-term.CryptoBirb, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that he is more bullish on XRP than he has ever been before, noting that there are a few key factors that warrant his bullishness.“First time ever I am bullish on XRP in my entire career. Here’s why: – 7-month consolidation – price action near range lows – solid HTF bullish momentum divergence – major altcoin sleeping giants slowly awaking – might be good addition for steady long-term growth.”Image Courtesy of CryptoBirbCould Ripple single-handedly thwart this bullish market structure?Many analysts and investors alike have attributed much of XRP’s bearishness in 2019 to Ripple’s quarterly token sales.It is possible that the company will continue providing a steady stream of selling pressure on the token, as they just unlocked nearly $200 million worth of XRP that could soon be sold on the open markets.Jacob Canfield – another prominent cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter – spoke about this latest escrow unlock, noting that the two consecutive escrow transfers total at 700 million XRP worth roughly $178 million.This latest escrow unlock could be a test of buyer’s strength, as sustained upward momentum could signal that the crypto will see significant further gains in spite of Ripple’s quarterly token sales.

150,CryptoSlate,Analyst: Chainlink shows hints of bullishness as the crypto market faces turbulence,Cole Petersen,1580725800.0,"It’s no secret that Chainlink was one of the best performing cryptos throughout 2019, with LINK clocking parabolic gains that are typically only seen during firm bull markets.It is important to note that LINK’s parabolic rally in 2019 was much more than simply a fleeting upwards market cycle, as the crypto’s bullishness has been sustainable and has spilled over into 2020.Analysts are now noting that the cryptocurrency could be on the cusp of seeing even further upside, as it is expressing multiple bullish technical formations that could allow it to surge independently of the aggregated crypto market.At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading down just over 3 percent at its current price of $2.78, which marks a notable decline from its daily highs of $2.91.It is important to note that today’s LINK selloff has come about concurrently with Bitcoin’s decline from daily highs of $9,650 to lows of $9,200.This drop led the aggregated crypto markets to closely follow suit, although it is important to note that Chainlink is still showing signs of imminent bullishness despite today’s dip.Satoshi Flipper, a well-respected cryptocurrency analyst, recently explained that LINK is caught within a bullish wedge that could help it see a rapid rally up to $3.00 in the coming several hours.“Beautiful falling wedge forming on LINK/USDT (4 hr) – just bounced off support and IF BTC behaves, the LINK/USDT # will go up.”Image Courtesy of Satoshi FlipperMultitude of bullish formations to further bolster LINKWhile looking beyond Chainlink’s short-term bullishness, it appears that the cryptocurrency’s macro structure also favors buyers, as the crypto is expressing a plethora of bullish structures over multiple timelines.Ethereum Jack, another popular crypto analyst, spoke about these structures in a tweet from late-last week while referencing a chart showing a pending inverse head and shoulder formation, as well as an upside target at 0.0004 BTC – a notable climb from its current price of 0.00029 BTC.“The amount of bullish structures on different time windows that can be found on LINK is just insane.”Image Courtesy of Ethereum JackRegardless of whether or not Bitcoin sees any notable upwards momentum in the near-term, it is highly probable that Chainlink will continue trading independent of the crypto markets, and it does seem as though its next major movement will favor bulls.

151,CryptoSlate,"What investing $1 daily in BTC, ETH, and XRP would have made you over time",Priyeshu Garg,1580627400.0,"Investing as little as $1 every day into Bitcoin over five years would have yielded an incredible 12x return. According to James Todaro, the managing partner at Blocktown Capital, an investment of $1,858 into Bitcoin would now be worth over $22,000 even when accounting for Bitcoin’s violent price swings.A dollar a day keeps bankruptcy awayFollowing its spectacular crash in December 2017, the term “long-term” and “stable” have been increasingly hard to associate with Bitcoin. While many see its violent price swings as proof that it’s nothing more than a speculative asset, Bitcoin is one of the best safe-haven assets out there.According to Todaro, even the smallest investment in Bitcoin yield incredible returns. Todaro created a visualization of what investing $1 a day into Bitcoin over the past five years would look like, showing that even Bitcoin’s most dramatic price drops haven’t affected its ROI.Graph showing Bitcoin’s price from 2011 to 2020His graph showed that if you would have invested $1 a day in Bitcoin for 5 years from February 2015 to February 2020, the investment would have shown a 12x return.

While a 6x return is certainly a significant one, it pales when compared to Bitcoin’s 12x.Graphs showing Ethereum’s price from 2015 to 2020However, even Bitcoin’s insane return is put to shame by that of XRP. Ripple‘s native cryptocurrency hasn’t been known for its ability to hold value long-term, but rather its ability to settle transactions quickly and efficiently.Nonetheless, $1 invested every day from Feb. 2, 2015, to Feb. 2, 2020, in XRP would amount to $1,823.

152,CryptoSlate,The price action of these cryptos is signaling that “altseason” is almost here,Ali Martinez,1580343840.0,"A new “altseason” appears to have begun as several altcoins are starting to post significant gains. As a matter of fact, Ethereum Classic is up nearly 300 percent since mid-December 2019 while Cardano and IOTA surged over 90 percent. The following technical analysis evaluates where ETC, ADA, and IOTA could go next.Ethereum Classic (ETC)Ethereum Classic entered a massive bull rally that has seen its price increase by 280 percent. This cryptocurrency went from trading at a low of $3.40 on Dec. 18, 2019, to a high of $12.90 on Jan. 29. Such an exponential bullish impulse allowed ETC to outperform the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap.Despite the substantial upswing, Ethereum Classic appears to have reached a significant resistance level that could slow down its uptrend. This price hurdle is represented by the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level, which has been able to act as support several times between March and October 2018. Now, it could serve as a strong barrier impeding ETC from a further advance.ETC/USD by TradingViewMoreover, the TD sequential indicator is presenting a sell signal in the form of a green nine on ETC’s 12-hour chart. This technical index estimates a one to four candlesticks correction or the beginning of a new downward countdown. A red two candlestick trading below a preceding red one candle could be used as confirmation of the bearish signal.ETC/USD by TradingViewA spike in sell orders around the current price levels could push Ethereum Classic down to the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level that sits at $10.65. Breaking below this support level could trigger a steeper correction taking ETC to test the next levels of support given by the 38.2 and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. These support barriers sit at $9.26 and $8.15, respectively.ETC/USD by TradingViewAlthough it seems like Ethereum Classic will not be able to break above $13 easily, an increase in demand could jeopardize the bearish outlook. If ETC is able to close above the recent high of $12.90 with enough volume, it could try to reach a new yearly high. The next level of resistance sits around $15.13.Cardano (ADA)The Cardano Foundation recently revealed that 2019 was a “transformational” year for the non-profit organization as well as for the development of its native cryptocurrency ADA. The Foundation’s team expanded across 12 countries pushing the growth of the Cardano community to more than 1.1 million individuals worldwide. Additionally, the firm teamed up with multiple companies to expand the utility of ADA.These achievements appear to be paying off already as Cardano is up over 90 percent since mid-December. In fact, this cryptocurrency climbed up from a low of $0.030 to a high of $0.057.The sudden upswing took ADA to hit the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement zone, which is currently containing its price from a further advance. This Fibonacci retracement area is considered by many traders as the ‘golden’ retracement zone due to the high probability of a rejection. An increase in the selling pressure behind this crypto could take it to pull back to the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level that sits at $0.044.ADA/USD by TradingViewSuch a retracement could form the right shoulder of a potential head-and-shoulders pattern that seems to be developing on ADA’s 3-day chart. This is a bullish formation that would be validated after the right shoulder is created and Cardano surges above the neckline that sits at $0.56. The head-and-shoulders pattern projects a 45 percent target to the upside upon the breakout point, which could take this crypto to $0.083. This target is determined by measuring the height from the neckline to the head of the bullish formation.ADA/USD by TradingViewIt is worth noting that an increase in sell orders that takes Cardano to close below $0.043 could invalidate the head-and-shoulders pattern. If this happens, ADA could try to test the next level of support around $0.037.IOTAIOTA is in a massive downtrend that was triggered after it reached an all-time high of $5.80 in mid-December 2017. Since then, this cryptocurrency continues making a series of lower lows and last month it hit $0.15. This price level has not been seen since the week of July 10, 2017.Despite the 97.50 percent decline that IOTA has suffered since it peaked in late 2017, demand for this cryptocurrency appears to be rising substantially. As a matter of fact, IOTA skyrocketed over 100 percent since Dec. 18, 2019. The price of this crypto went from hovering at a low of $0.15 to a high of $0.31 on Jan. 29.Now, IOTA is trying to break above the 100-three-day moving average on its 3-day chart which is serving as an important level of resistance. Closing above this price hurdle could allow it to continue surging to the next level of resistance given by the 200-day moving average. This barrier is currently sitting at $0.40.IOTA/USD by TradingViewNevertheless, it appears that breaking above the 100-three-day moving average will not be easy. The TD sequential indicator is currently presenting a sell signal in the form of a green nine on IOTA’s 12-hour chart. This bearish formation predicts a one to four candlestick correction or the beginning of a new downward trend.IOTA/USD by TradingViewIf the sell signal presented by the TD sequential indicator is validated, IOTA could plunge to try to find support around the 38.2 or the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. These levels of support sit at $0.25 and $0.23, respectively.IOTA/USD by TradingViewHowever, a spike in volume that takes IOTA to close above the recent high of $0.31 could signal a continuation of the bullish trend. If this happens, one could expect a further advance to the next level of resistance around $0.34.Overall sentimentEthereum Classic, Cardano, and IOTA appear to be bound for a retracement following the substantial bull rally that these cryptocurrencies experienced since mid-December 2019. Although a correction seems imminent, it could serve as take profit point for investors and as an opportunity for sideliners to get back in the market. A new inflow of capital would likely allow these cryptos to continue their uptrends.This scenario can also be seen on the altcoins dominance chart. At the moment, the altcoins dominance appears to be forming an ascending triangle on the 1-day chart. Following the recent retest of the upper boundary of the triangle, the altcoins dominance could retrace to the hypotenuse.Altcoins Dominance ChartIt is worth noting that a bullish impulse may allow the altcoins dominance to break out of the ascending triangle where it has been contained since August 2019. This could trigger a further advance allowing altcoins to capture a 43 percent of the cryptocurrency market share.It remains to be seen when altcoins dominance would be able to breakout of this pattern. But, when that happens, a new full blown “altseason” would likely start.Posted In: Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

The exchange is the first U.S. marketplace to offer staking rewards for both coins, it said in the release.Catherine Coley, the CEO of Binance.US said:“Staking is just one of the many attractive ways we are bringing new people into the digital asset marketplace.”Coley believes that staking is a way to reward users for being a part of a community, and as such, is “one of the key components of America’s pathway to economic freedom.”Binance encourages the spread of stakingWhile this is the first time the company has offered staking to its users in the U.S., it’s not the first time it experimented with staking. Back in September 2019, Binance launched its dedicated staking platform enabling its users to stake their XLM, KMD, ALGO, QTUM, and STRAT tokens and earn rewards on their holdings.Users in the U.S. will only be able to start ALGO and ATOM for the time being, but the exchange will make the process start automatically once the program goes live in February. The company said in the announcement:“Seventy percent of crypto users are focused on holding onto their assets rather than trading them, so staking provides an ideal solution for holders to passively earn rewards by supporting the operation of various blockchain networks.”The automatic staking, however, might not be enough to get a significant number of users aboard. The company seems to be aware of this, as they have called users to visit Binance Academy, its educational arm, to learn about what staking is.Update at 20:38:30 GMT on Jan. 30: The company name in the article was changed from Binance to Binance.US since they are separate entities.Posted In: Binance, U.S., Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

154,CryptoSlate,Cardano announces new release for Yoroi Wallet,Priyeshu Garg,1580202000.0,"Cardano announced the launch of the Yoroi Shelley extension 2.4.0 for both Chrome and Firefox users. The release comes with several new features, including the ability to undelegate their ADA from a stake pool and a faster wallet resync process.Yoroi Wallet gets a new update and a slew of new featuresYoroi, the first lightweight wallet for Cardano, has announced the launch of its version 2.4.0. According to the official announcement, the new version has been released to both Chrome and Firefox users and, apart from regularly scheduled updates, will bring about four new features.The feature most users will benefit from is the addition of undelegating. The company explained that the wallet now supports undelegating their ADA from a pool, which could be useful for people wanting to switch and start their own pool.Screengrab showing the “undelegate” option in the new version of Yoroi. (Source: Twitter)“The delegation page will be improved in next week’s update to make this feature more intuitive”When it comes to choosing a new pool, Yoroi wanted to make the process as democratic as possible. The default sorting order in the wallet’s newest version will be set to “random.” Each user will get a different random order, the company said, adding that this was done to encourage users to discover new stake pools.Screengrab showing the new default sorting order for stake pools on Yoroi. (Source: Twitter)Easier debugging and problem solving in version 2.4.0The other two features introduced in Yoroi’s latest release both focus on improving user experience and enabling faster debugging.Users will now be able to see if their wallet upgrade transaction appears on an explorer.

(Source: Twitter)Apart from that, any other problems that might arise during the testnet can be solved with a simple resync. Yoroi introduced the option to resync the wallet from a button inside the settings dialog page. Before the update, users would have to re-install Yoroi and re-type their recovery phrases each time they ran into a problem with the testnet.Screengrab of the “resync wallet” button inside the settings dialog page in the new version of Yoroi.

155,CryptoSlate,IOHK working hard on making Cardano a commercial product,Priyeshu Garg,1580117400.0,"Significant efforts are being made to transition Cardano from a science project to an actual commercial product. According to Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, heavy efforts are currently underway both at IOHK and at the Cardano Foundation to push product marketing and develop the commercial side of the blockchain.In a recent update, Hoskinson addressed some of the issues users had with the Shelley Incentivized Testnet, emphasizing that despite its success, it was still a developing product.Cardano development picking up velocity after the holidays“We’re very happy with what we’ve been able to do.”These are the words of Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, the company behind Cardano. In his latest YouTube update, Hoskinson went over the current state of Cardano and addressed some of the issues the project was faced with in the past weeks, the first one being the holidays.The immense success of the Shelley Incentivized Testnet has brought on serious work for the Cardano teams, whose tight development and update schedule seems to have been cut short by the holiday season. Hoskinson apologized for the lack of significant progress in the past few weeks, explaining that December and January are notoriously the most frustrating months when it comes to product launches.But, even with the slightly slower teams, Cardano development looks like it has gone into overdrive.According to Hoskinson, milestone number 3 for the Shelley Incentivized Testnet should be released on Jan. 29. The teams have also begun aggregating statistics regarding the testnet from different sources and should be published by the end of the month. The team’s consolidated statistics will be an improved version of the statistics the Cardano community has been publishing every few epochs.The teams working on Haskell development have also established a two-week sprint structure, with a post-mortem being done at the end of every sprint, Hoskinson explained.While he said that the velocity in the second half of January was looking very good, Cardano development will really start picking up the pace in February. February will be the first month Cardano product managers will begin doing “data dumps” as Hoskinson called them.The monthly or bi-weekly video updates are part of Cardano’s overall effort to bring more transparency into its development process and improve communication with its community.February will also see Dynal Patel, a senior product manager at Cardano, coming up with a plan on how to transition the Rust incentivized testnet to the Haskell incentivized testnet. Hoskinson noted that this is extremely important as it will allow more than 900 entities that have already registered their stake pools on the Shelley Incentivized Testnet to operate their testnets in Haskell.Solving problems with the Shelley Incentivized TestnetWhile Hoskinson said that he was extremely satisfied with the amount of ADA that has been delegated on the testnet and the number of stake pools that have been created, he noted that there were still issues with the network that needed to be resolved.Most of the smaller technical problems have been resolved with the patches that have been released in the past month. However, the biggest problem the network faced was community expectations, as many users complained about the user interface on the testnet.Hoskinson said that there have been significant complaints and criticism aimed at Cardano due to the complexity of the testnet user experience. He explained that this happened because people have “conflated the user experience on the Rust incentivized testnet with that of the incentivized testnet built for Haskell. The Haskell code will have a better user experience by design, as it is specifically made to host a consumer product on an everyday computer, he added.Rust was chosen for the incentivized testnet because it allowed quick and efficient technical updates, Hoskinson said. Its sole purpose was to test the business user experience of staking and was intended only for technically sophisticated stake pool operators.“It was never intended to be a consumer product”Building the incentivized testnet on Rust allowed the teams to identify all of the technical requirements of the network and then build them into the final Haskell product. From that perspective, Hoskinson said, the testnet was a huge success.The amount of development that has gone into Haskell isn’t surprising at all, ss it will be the code which stake pool operators will build on and use to verify their infrastructure is working.Hoskinson said:“This is the foundation upon which all code for the entire Cardano roadmap will be launched.”The code has been rewritten three times, the final time being using a formal methodology. All of the Shelley features have been built on the third-time rewritten code, he explained.“Because this code is so well written and well understood, it has high velocity when we add new features to it.”Strong effort to push forward the commercial side of CardanoParallel to the development of Haskell, both IOHK and the Cardano Foundation will be ramping up efforts to make Cardano recognizable as a commercial product. While the commercial director will be creating the overall “commercial” strategy, the Cardano Foundation will be merging the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and Cardano by using PwC as a model.The business consulting giant will be responsible for creating a consolidated commercial strategy for Cardano by taking input from McCann, the advertising company tasked with rebranding Cardano. Once all of the information from both Emurgo and the Cardano Foundation has been consolidated, PwC will hold a multi-day workshop where the final commercial strategy will be revealed.Their job, Hoskinson explained, will be to make sure everything Cardano-related is aligned and that heavy emphasis is put on product marketing.In the meantime, IOHK will focus on trying to find a consolidated way for exchanges to list ADA. Hoskinson said that business requirements from cryptocurrency exchanges will slowly be worked into the overall commercial strategy, allowing potential partners to easily onboard ADA in the future.This could prove to be a key move for Cardano. Hoskinson said that there has been a “high degree of interest in Cardano as a platform” at the World Economic Forum at Davos last week, which is why it’s crucial that as much institutional infrastructure gets built while the platform is still at one of its earliest stages.IOHK’s job, Hoskinson said, is to make sure to turn those interest points into tangible products. Until then, it’s all a test of patience, as most of the heavy lifting in terms of formal processes and research has already been completed.Posted In: Cardano, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

156,CryptoSlate,Cardano’s latest Shelley Incentivized Testnet update focuses on stability,Priyeshu Garg,1579935600.0,"The Cardano team has been working hard on maintaining and improving the Shelley Incentivized Testnet. As part of their newly established community outreach program, the company said it introduced a new version of the Jormungandr Node, v.0.8.7, to reduce technical debt and ensure a more stable network.Network stability remains the number one priority for ShelleyThe immense success the Shelley Incentivized Testnet has seen since its November launch has pushed the company to improve its communication. Last month, Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, said that the team working on the incentivized testnet will begin issuing weekly updates about the state of the network to stay in touch with the community.As part of that effort, the project manager for the Shelley Incentivized testnet issued this week’s report, revealing what the team has been struggling with. In a YouTube video, Dimitris Poulopoulos said that the network stability still remains the number one priority.According to him, major improvements in the testnet were already seen with last week’s release of version 0.8.6, as many members of the community reacted positively to the update. This week’s release, Poulopoulos said, is aimed to improve things further with a new version of the Jormungandr Node—v0.8.7.The release contains network improvements that should both reduce technical debt and ensure a more stable network, he added.Bootstrap issues resolved, degraded performance improved, congestion relieved“With this release, we are expecting improvements to the overall connections management,” Poulopoulos said in the video.He explained that oversubscribed nodes will now always have room to open a new connection, while idle connections will be recycled more aggressively. This, he said, should relieve some of the congestion observed in trusted peers.Apart from that, several other performance issues regarding node overload have been resolved by sanitizing internal locking. Some dependency updates have also been made in the latest release, with some parts rewritten in standard Rust programming language.The addition of the new p2p.max_connections_threshold configuration parameter will reserve more room for block propagating connections. While this is just a tactical fix, further improvements will be made in the future, he explained. Synchronous locks won’t be getting mixed in with asynchronous network code anymore, which is expected to mitigate the spikes that preceded instances when Stake Pools get stuck.While a lot has been done to patch up some of the problems the incentivized testnet has seen this past week, Poulopoulos said that more issues will be addressed in the next update. Improving Jormungandr stability will be the main focus throughout the month, he added.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

According to the company’s announcement, XAU₮ will be available both on Ethereum and on TRON and will represent one troy fine ounce of gold.Tether diversifies into traditional assets, launches gold-backed cryptocurrencyTether will be diversifying into traditional assets, as well. According to a press release shared with CryptoSlate, the company will be launching Tether Gold (XAU₮), a digital asset providing exposure to physical gold (XAU).The XAU₮ token will represent ownership of one troy fine ounce of physical gold on a specific London Good Delivery gold bar. The company claims the token is the only gold-backed coin that guarantees direct control over the physical gold storage. All XAU₮ tokens will be stored in a vault in Switzerland, guarded with best in class security and anti-threat measures, it said in the announcement.While no further information on which bank will store the gold bars was released, Tether said that it is the only product among the competition that offers zero custody fees. However, fees will be charged on buying and redeeming tokens.Two blockchains, one gold-backed coinTether Gold will be available both as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and as a TRC20 token on the TRON blockchain, the company said. Users can transfer the newly launched coin to any on-chain address from their Tether wallets.The gold-backed cryptocurrency will be issued by TG Commodities Limited, a U.K.-based company dealing in the wholesale of metals and metal ores.According to Tether, XAU₮ was launched as an answer to the growing demand for digital exposure to physical gold. Paolo Ardoino, the CTO at Tether, called the launch “a timely innovation in the crypto ecosystem.” He said:“Tether Gold provides the combined benefits of both physical and digital assets, removing the drawbacks of holding gold in more traditional ways, such as high storage costs and restricted access.”The Tether Gold website says that holders of XAU₮ will be able to redeem their tokens in the form of physical gold if they have completed the verification process mandated by TG Commodities Limited and hold a “required minimum number of XAU₮.”However, the token isn’t aimed at the average retail investor. The minimum purchase allowed is 50 XAU₮ or 50 fine troy ounces, which cost around $75,000 at last month’s prices. Fractions of the coin, however, will be soon traded at Bitfinex.Posted In: Tether, Bitfinex, Altcoins, Stablecoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

159,CryptoSlate,Ethereum’s consolidation trend may turn into a full-blown bull rally if it breaks this key level,Cole Petersen,1579653660.0,"Ethereum has been able to begin gaining some tempered momentum following its recent drop to lows of $162, as ETH has now pushed its way back up towards the $170 region.Although the cryptocurrency is still trading down slightly from its recent highs of $177 that was set this past Saturday, its ability to hold above the key support it has established within the lower-$160 region is a positive sign.This has led one prominent analyst to note that Ethereum could soon see a notable upwards movement that allows the cryptocurrency to surge past its recent highs and possibly back into the $200 region.Ethereum inches higher as the crypto market continues consolidatingAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading up marginally at its current price of $167, and it is currently slightly outperforming Bitcoin.It is important to note that the cryptocurrency has been stuck beneath $170 in the time following its recent dip from the mid-$170 region, and it appears to have formed a relatively tight trading range between its recent lows of $162 and its highs of $168.If ETH is able to break above the upper boundary of this trading range as it continues to inch higher, it is possible that it will firmly break its close correlation to Bitcoin and revisit its major near-term resistance region that sits around $177.If ETH breaks above $180 it could start a major uptrendNik Patel – a prominent cryptocurrency analyst and trader – shared his thoughts on Ethereum’s recent price action in a post on his blog, in which he notes that he believes an ideal long entry on the crypto can be found around $152. He explained while referencing the aforementioned trading range:“Price remains in consolidation between these two levels and I would be looking to get long at $152 if price does begin to take a fall here.”Image Courtesy of Nik PatelFurthermore, Patel also goes on to note that a break above $177 would also mark a break above its 360-day moving average, which means that a solid close above this level could mean that a massive rally will ensue if it goes on to move above $180. He concisely noted:“If…we get a close above the 360MA, I would look to rebuy a retest of the $180 area.”If ETH is able to break above the upper boundary of its current trading range, it could help catalyze a movement that sends it up to its key resistance in the upper-$170 region, and how it trades at this level could offer insight into where it trends throughout 2020.

160,CryptoSlate,Bitcoin Cash appears to be leading the altcoin markets; is a major rally brewing?,Cole Petersen,1579575600.0,"The aggregated crypto markets have been subjected to the volatility experienced by Bitcoin over the past several days, which has primarily favored bears. The recent market-wide downswing has led altcoins like Bitcoin Cash to shed some of their recent gains, although their market structures still remain firmly bullish.Analysts are now noting that Bitcoin Cash has been leading the aggregated crypto markets, which could signal that where it trends in the near-term will offer insight into where other major altcoins head next.With this in mind, it does appear to be a strong possibility that the markets could be on the cusp of a sizeable rally, as Bitcoin Cash is showing some signs of bullishness at the moment.Bitcoin Cash May Be Frontrunning the Aggregated Altcoin MarketCurrently, Bitcoin Cash is trading up 2% at its current price of $341, which marks a decent climb from daily lows of $325, and only a slight drop from highs of $350.Over a one-week period it is clear that the crypto is firmly being controlled by bulls, as it is up from lows of $275. Its rise from these lows has come about against a backdrop of bullishness seen by Bitcoin and other major altcoins, but BCH has been generally outperforming the markets.One interesting factor that should be noted is that BCH appears to be frontrunning the aggregated crypto markets, meaning that altcoin traders can get hints as to where other cryptos will trend based on Bitcoin Cash’s price action.“Majors Update: One month later, and nothing’s changed. • $BCH continues to lead: +60% (5 up impulses) • $LTC following: +20% (4 impulses) • $ETH finally: +10% (3 impulses). Cross coin correlation is an extremely powerful method when it comes to alts, majors particularly,” Hsaka, a popular crypto analyst, explained in a tweet from this weekend.Is BCH Signaling That the Markets Are About to Rally?Bitcoin Cash has also formed a striking correlation to Bitcoin SV throughout 2020, with the two cryptocurrencies incurring similar price action – albeit seeing different magnitudes of gains.“I wonder why $BCH and $BSV have the exact same chart. It’s almost creepy how similar these movements are. Perfectly timed,” DonAlt, another popular analyst, explained.Because Bitcoin SV is trading up 9% currently and is attempting to spark yet another parabolic upswing, it is a strong possibility that BCH will do the same and drag the altcoin markets up with it.

161,CryptoSlate,Cardano packs its schedule with new releases every week,Priyeshu Garg,1579507200.0,"The immense success of the Shelley incentivized testnet seems to have left Cardano invigorated and ready to pick up the pace when it comes to development. According to Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, the company is up for quite an eventful couple of months. He shared upcoming plans and events in a recent interview and AMA.The past few months have been ‘illuminating’ Hoskinson saysFor a project that has been so widely criticized for its slow development, Cardano now seems to be moving at the speed of light. Following the successful launch of the incentivized testnet for the Shelley era of the Cardano blockchain, the team behind the ambitious project seems to have crossed an important threshold that put its development into overdrive.According to Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, Cardano’s parent company, the past few weeks have been “illuminating.” Not only has the company changed its product and project, but they’ve also significantly updated their management estimations, he said in a recent AMA.The company, known for its no-nonsense and transparent updates, has set up a new release cadence, with new updates and releases expected on a weekly basis. The Shelley Incentivized Testnet just received its first update of the year, the Daedalus wallet is on a weekly release cycle, while Haskell will receive updates every two weeks.Frequent updates to Daedalus are necessary to complete its hardware support, Hoskinson explained, saying that users will soon be able to restore their ledger devices to Daedalus. Hardware multi-sig and hardware cold staking are also expected to happen in a future firmware update.All of the work that Cardano teams have been putting in won’t be in vain. Hoskinson said that this is all in anticipation of the release of the Shelley mainnet. In the meantime, the company has been having “great conversations” about staking-as-a-service, he went on, adding that the continually evolving software will ease Cardano’s release into more exchanges.“”I’ve never seen the company so unified and moving so quickly.”Cardano reveals an ambitious strategy for 2020When it comes to the company’s plan for the upcoming year, it’s safe to say that the team’s schedule will be packed. The launch requirements for Goguen, the era of Cardano that will enable Dapps on the network, are currently being prepared. To create an infrastructure that will facilitate a healthy dapp ecosystem, both IOHK and the Cardano Foundations are knee-deep in discussions with potential partners.Hoskinson himself will use his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos as a “networking opportunity,” as leaders from both the blockchain and the traditional finance industry will be attending the event.February and March will also be packed. According to Hoskinson, Cardano’s first workshop with auditing giant PwC will be held sometime in February, while the first output from the workshop should be available in early March.The OBFT hard fork will most likely occur in February, but Hoskinson noted that Cardano is still “interfacing” with its exchange partners about it in order to make sure all of the infrastructure necessary for the fork to occur is lined up. The Haskell node for the Byron reboot will be integrated with the Haskell wallet backend and should get out to users in February as well.The company’s partnership with McCann Dublin advertising agency, which was tasked with leading Cardano’s rebranding effort last month, is expected to yield its first results in March. This, Hoskinson said, will allow the company to talk about Cardano’s unique selling points to a wider audience.Cardano’s work with the European Union is also expected to pick up the pace in the following few weeks. Hoskinson said that the company was working alongside IBM research and the Horizons 2020 project for the E.U.-sponsored decentralized software update program. The work that has gone into the program has resulted in a 39-page paper about decentralized software updates, which is an achievement Hoskinson seemed particularly proud of.Working on communicationHoskinson’s latest YouTube update also seems to be in line with the company’s general plan for the first quarter of the year. At the end of 2019, he said that Cardano plans on setting up a regular communication schedule to keep the community informed about all of the in-house developments.“These regular updates won’t stop at the incentivized testnet,” Hoskinson revealed, adding that product managers will also begin giving weekly updates on their areas of expertise. The ultimate goal, he said, is to hit a monthly cadence for product updates.Hoskinson’s effort to create a transparent communications channel between the team working on Cardano and the Cardano community seems to stem, at least in part, from his aversion towards crypto media. In an interview with Hackernoon last week, Hoskinson said that the media doesn’t have the right incentives to focus on “good journalism.”He admitted that Cardano hasn’t done the best of jobs to communicate with “everyday people,” which is why most of the media coverage Cardano has seen in the past couple of years have been focused more on sensationalism than on the ground-breaking research that the company was built on.And sensationalism is one of a handful of words that are becoming increasingly hard to attribute to Hoskinson. He remains one of the few high-profile industry figures that doesn’t shy away from praising his competition—his latest YouTube update began with a kudos to Dash and Ethereum Classic, both of which have achieved significant success over the past couple of weeks.One of the many efforts IOHK is putting into improving communication is hosting hackathons. The Cardano Foundation is already looking at master plans for the entire year to ensure that the blockchain the hackathons will work on “is going where it needs to go.”“We’re looking forward to having a hackathon or event every month in each major development area,” Hoskinson said, adding that this is the best way to let people know that Cardano is a platform you can actually build on.When it comes to the rest of the market, Hoskinson’s input seems to be that the entire space is slowly beginning to wake up and mature. He noted that the bull trend the market saw in the past weeks isn’t an anomaly, but a representative sample of the rest of the year. While it’s hard to say whether the bull trend will turn into a full bull market, he seems to believe that the ice from the year-long crypto winter is finally thawing.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, People, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

IOTA and the IOTA community, through forum discussions on IOTA.cafe, have both participated in refining the original Coordicide research.“Nevertheless, it is necessary to compile all of these components into a single “state-of-the-art” document, so that our solution may receive the scrutiny it deserves from our academic, corporate, and community collaborators,” the company said in its blog post.Apart from that, the paper will be extensively used by the company in-house, in order to review their own internal process of moving from theory to specification to code.The Coordicide research grant program seems to have paid offThe generous grant IOTA established last year seems to have paid out. Back in August 2019, the company announced a $5 million grant program to contribute to “Coordicide”-related research. The first push towards Coordicide, an upgrade that removed the network’s centralized coordinating node, was announced in May the same year.Unlike other major cryptocurrencies, which use a blockchain-based structure for their network, IOTA uses a technology called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). DAGs allow multiple chains of transactions to co-exist and interconnect, which makes the network highly scalable.However, DAGs themselves also present serious challenges regarding security and decentralization, which are problems both Coordicide and Coordinator set out to solve.The interconnectedness of the IOTA network depends on one transaction validating two previous ones before being able to validate itself. The Coordinator’s job is to ensure that transactions don’t contradict previous transactions which could lead to double spending and accessing non-existent funds.Coordicide will effectively remove the Coordinator, which will be a momentous step towards realizing IOTA’s promise as the first decentralized and scalable DLT, the company said.Posted In: IOTA, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

163,CryptoSlate,This technical formation could mean Ethereum is in for massive short-term upside,Cole Petersen,1579251600.0,"It has grown increasingly unclear in recent times as to whether or not the aftermath of the recent uptrend seen by Bitcoin and major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) marks any type of fundamental shift in market structure, or if it is simply another lower-high that will be followed by further losses.In spite of this lack of clarity, analysts are now pointing to some bourgeoning technical patterns for guidance as to where the markets will trend next.In the case of Ethereum, these technical signs seem to favor the cryptocurrency’s bulls, as they may signal that it will soon see some further upwards momentum.Ethereum inches lower as it closely tracks BitcoinAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading down nominally at its current price of $165, and it appears to be closely tracking Bitcoin’s price action as the markets attempt to establish some momentum.Despite facing a swift rejection at highs of over $170 earlier this week, ETH has been able to maintain some stability within the $160 region and it appears to be in a consolidation phase that could be followed by a major movement.One technical factor that should be considered in the near-term is that Ethereum appears to be currently trading within a bull flag, which could mean that this bout of sideways trading will be followed by a massive upwards movement.“Ethereum: What was a bullish pennant, now perhaps a bull flag. Volume decreasing, textbook for a pennant,” Mr. Jozza, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained while pointing to the chart seen below.Image Courtesy of Mr. JozzaThese factors could bolster eth’s bulls and perpetuate a major upside swingThe bull flag that Ethereum is currently in the process of forming isn’t the only factor currently counting in the favor of the cryptocurrency’s bulls, as Bitcoin Jack – another prominent analyst – pointed out a few other key factors that should be considered by investors.He notes that ETH has been able to break its volume downtrend and has been able to flip its previous resistance level into a support level – two factors that suggest it will soon see notable upside.“ETH vs BTC daily chart update: Volume down-trend broken on sharp move up. Rejection of resistance was met with flipping old local resistance in to support. If price can breach into old range above, target 1 becomes viable quickly. A pullback into green is for buying,” he said while referencing the levels marked on the below chart.Image Courtesy of Bitcoin JackBitcoin’s price action may have significant influence over that of Ethereum and other altcoins, but the technical factors discussed above may be enough to allow ETH to break its BTC correlation and garner some independent momentum.Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

164,CryptoSlate,Crypto market incurs technical strength as altcoins begin turning parabolic,Cole Petersen,1579157880.0,"The crypto market’s firm uptrend has allowed multiple major altcoins to begin going parabolic, which to many investors is emblematic of the early stages of the massive bull run seen in late 2017.The recent series of rallies seen by both Bitcoin and other major altcoins has allowed the market to break out of a key descending channel that was previously guiding it lower, which may signal that this uptrend is just getting started.Crypto Market Breaks Through a Key Level; Here’s Why This Is So ImportantThe massive uptrend seen across the aggregated market has primarily been rooted in Bitcoin’s recent rally from its January lows of $6,800 to highs of $8,900.After tapping $8,900 and facing a minor rejection, BTC’s bulls have been able to support its price within the upper-$8,000 region, pointing to underlying strength amongst buyers.Bitcoin’s ongoing period of sideways trading within the upper-$8,000 region has provided an ideal backdrop for major altcoins to begin posting some massive gains, which has revitalized investors’ sentiment.Crypto Rand, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that the aggregated crypto markets recently broke out of a strong multi-month descending channel, pointing to the possibility that the ongoing rally is just getting started.“CRYPTO MARKETCAP | Breaking up a 6 months downtrend and beating volume records. Looking awesome,” he said while pointing to the chart seen below.Image Courtesy of Crypto RandAltcoins Begin Going Parabolic; Is a Major Market-Wide Movement Inbound?Investors have long speculated as to when the highly anticipated “altseason” could begin, and it now appears that it could be closer than many people previously thought.Over the past couple of days, multiple major altcoins have incurred parabolic rallies that have harkened back to late-2017.Bitcoin SV has been able to climb over 160 percent from its weekly lows, and this is even after considering the sizable retrace it incurred today when it plummeted from intra-rally highs of over $400 to its current price of $306.DASH is another crypto that is currently in the throes of a parabolic uptrend, as it has been able to surge nearly 200 percent from its weekly lows of under $50, and it is now fast approaching its one-year highs that were set in June of 2019.Bitcoin’s price action in the coming days will be critical for determining the sustainability of the rallies seen by many altcoins, as any sharp downturn could place the markets back into a bear-favoring downtrend.Posted In: Bitcoin, Dash, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
165,CryptoSlate,How top altcoins trend in coming days could set the tone for the entire crypto market in 2020,Cole Petersen,1579066200.0,"Bitcoin has been able to significantly extend its recently incurred upwards momentum, creating a strong upwards tailwind that has allowed nearly all major altcoins in the crypto market to post massive gains over the past couple of days and weeks.The massive market-wide rally seen since early-January seems to have reached a boiling point earlier today, with many major altcoins began climbing 10 percent or more while one top crypto even posted a massive 130 percent rally.Whether or not the markets are able to maintain this momentum in the coming several hours and days could offer significant insight into which way the markets will trend next, with one analyst noting that some altcoins could soon see significantly larger rallies if they are able to hold above their key support levels.Crypto markets rally as investor’s outlook brightensCurrently, of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin and Binance Coin are the only ones trading up less than 10 percent, with Bitcoin SV – the controversial Bitcoin Cash hard fork – leading the way with an unprecedented 130 percent climb.The market’s ability to continue surging higher following its recent bounce from its late-December lows suggests that many altcoins could be in the process of forming long-term bottoms, which signals that a bull market could be just around the corner.Financial Survivalism, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that the next few days are of critical importance for altcoins, as to how they trade now could set the tone for where the trend in the months ahead. He noted:“These next few days are probably more important for $alts than $BTC. $ETH, $LTC and many others are on the verge of putting in a higher lower on the weekly. If they can follow through then there would be some big targets, but it is too early to get over excited.”Analyst: risk-reward ratio on altcoins is massive, but they face strong resistanceFinancial Survivalism further goes on to note that it is too early to decisively know which way altcoins will trend in the near-term, but he does explain that the risk-reward ratio on many of these tokens is massive, with much of the risk stemming from the strong resistance they are currently facing. He said:“Conclusion: It is too early to be married to a conclusion, instead it’s time to pay very close attention. I was buying some $alts last week, mainly due to EMASAR buy signals. The risk:reward on longs is great, but there is still a lot of resistance overhead.”The coming few days should shine a light on just how bullish this ongoing rally is in the long run for both Bitcoin and smaller cryptos.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

166,CryptoSlate,Vechain CEO says China banning crypto trading is actually a good thing,Priyeshu Garg,1578987000.0,"In a recent interview where he gave an update about the current state of Vechain, Sunny Lu said that China made the right decision when it banned cryptocurrency trading That way, he said, the country eliminated all of the “bad guys” in the space and is now able to facilitate the development of blockchain technologies with actual use cases and implementations.2019 was a successful year for VechainDespite an almost year-long bear market, last year was monumental for the crypto industry. Apart from a maturing market, increased adoption, and major technological developments, the industry also saw increased interest from both governments and enterprises.It was also a great year for Vechain, at least according to its CEO Sunny Lu. The growth Vechain has seen throughout the year managed to outpace the parabolic rise it saw at the height of the crypto market back in 2017.In an interview with Nugget’s News Alex Saunders, Lu looked back at 2019 and said it was a year of changes and challenges. The crypto industry is no longer a niche market, he explained, as major players such as Facebook began entering the space. He said that the growth of the market is also visible in the number of countries that have opened their doors to crypto companies, listing Malta and San Marino as two examples of pro-crypto governments.However, the biggest thing that has happened to the blockchain industry is, without a doubt, President Xi Jinping’s public endorsement of the technology. Lu said that the controversial address was exciting both for him personally and for Vechain, as China is now openly pushing for the development of a technology Vechain had been working on for the past four years.With more than 40 enterprise applications developed on its platform, Vechain is the kind of company China’s blockchain initiative was built for.Lu’s extremely positive reaction to China’s blockchain stance is uncommon in the industry. Many criticize the country’s tight grip over tech development in general, but the biggest thorn in their eyes is still the outright ban on cryptocurrency trading.Lu, however, doesn’t see this as a problem.“Banning crypto trading is a good thing,” Lu said in the interview.According to him, China’s massive population means that different rules have to be applied in order to keep such a fast-growing industry in check. Considering the sheer number of people living in China, around 1.3 billion, as well as the complexity of its government, a blanket ban on all trading was a smart move, Lu explained. He went on to say that nipping crypto trading in the bud before it became too big to handle enabled the country to craft specific regulations and stop “bad guys” from entering the space.Xi Jinping’s blockchain endorsement was a huge boost for VechainClearing the industry of any bad actors was what enabled China to invest so heavily into blockchain development. Lu said that October 25, the day Xi gave his now-famous speech about the importance of blockchain, was the most important day of the year.Following his endorsement, Lu noticed that the confidence in the entire blockchain industry went up. This was confirmed in the weeks following the speech, when “billion-dollar companies” began approaching Vechain about a potential collaboration.However revolutionary it might sound, this is not a new thing for Vechain. Lu explained that the company was built as an answer to Ethereum‘s lack of enterprise solutions. Vechain set out to bridge the gap between groundbreaking tech and an actual, usable platform. Lu really set out to create a business-centric platform — during the interview, the told the story of how he interviewed around 40 c-level executives from a variety of different industries in order to find out what they were interested in when it came to blockchain technology.The feedback he gathered in 2015 enabled the company to build a platform in the likes of Amazon and Alibaba, which offer standardized and simplified tools for users. With clients such as BMW and Walmart, and pilot projects with retail giant H&M, Vechain seems to be on the right track.When asked about the company’s plan to offer Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS), Lu said its ToolChain platform is being increasingly explored by enterprises. He listed Deloitte and PwC as some of the companies that are currently looking into the specialized platform. The Singapore-based company also lists Breyer Capital, Renault, Microsoft, and LVMH as its clients.Despite last year’s success, still, a long way to go for blockchain technologyBut, despite an incredibly positive outlook and optimistic predictions for the future, Lu is aware that blockchain technology is still at its infancy. Even some of the most widely known and most heavily developed platforms on the market, such as Ethereum, are basic at most when it comes to their capabilities.Lu compared Ethereum to Netscape and the current state of the crypto industry to the early days of the internet in the 1990s. Just like Netscape revolutionized internet browsing, Ethereum changed the blockchain industry from its core. However, Lu said he doesn’t see it going to the “next level,” just like Netscape failed to do after other browsers became available.But, despite his criticism of Ethereum, Lu made it clear that there was no bad blood between the two companies. It was Ethereum’s own Vitalik Buterin that got Lu interested in blockchain technology — a greeting and a thank you note to Ethereum are actually embedded in the genesis block of Vechain.Because Vechain wasn’t modeled after Ethereum, it’s more future proof than other similar platforms. Lu said that the company’s plan to use its native token VET in “financial applications” is currently in motion and that a Whitepaper 2.0 is in the works. When asked why they waited so long to dive into DeFi waters, Lu said:“[The] time wasn’t right for this kind of use when Vechain launched.”With more than 35 million transactions recorded in 2019, most of which have come from smart contracts, Vechain now seems confident it’s ready to conquer the DeFi world.Lu addressed some of the issues Saunders raised when it comes to VET. Vechain’s native token has been struggling with trading volume and is listed on just a handful of exchanges, which could deter both companies and traders from engaging with Vechain.The CEO said the company has avoided pursuing listings aggressively, as they are very careful with the resources they have. “Being traded on few exchanges is okay for now,” he told Saunders, adding that more listings will happen once more businesses onboard Vechain.Posted In: VeChain, China, Altcoins, People, Regulation     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

168,CryptoSlate,Does the Bitcoin SV Genesis upgrade support the narrative that Craig Wright is Satoshi?,Omar Faridi,1578963600.0,"Contentious Bitcoin Cash hard fork Bitcoin SV (BSV) has surged over 25% percent in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s significant price increase has led to a parabolic rally which may result in all-time highs for BSV.However, many crypto community members believe that Bitcoin SV might be an “exit scam,” which may serve as a get rich quick scheme for its creators. Twitter user @thomcanterbury said:“BSV genesis upgrade is a trojan horse for being able to move satoshi coins on that chain (they won’t and can’t move on Bitcoin (BTC) chain) in order to continue the narrative that CSW is satoshi. This is all being coordinated alongside the court case. Truly spectacular.”Previous sanction ordering Wright to give up Bitcoin holdings will not standA US District Judge recently ruled that a previous sanction instructing Craig Wright the self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor, to surrender half of his BTC holdings to Dave Kleiman’s estate will not stand.US Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart had announced the sanction ruling in August 2019 in the long-running court battle concerning 1.1 million BTC, which were allegedly mined by Wright and Kleiman during Bitcoin’s early days.Court documents submitted to the US District Court in Florida on Jan. 10 confirmed that Judge Beth Bloom determined that Reinhart’s previous sanction order was improper.Last year, Reinhart had ruled that Wright had perjured himself by intentionally submitting fake documents. The judge had asked Wright to give up more than 50 percent of the alleged 1.1 million Bitcoin in his possession.The court can’t determine how much BTC Wright ownsBut the recent ruling indicates that the sanction was improper, as certain facts such as Wright being an equal partner with Kleiman are not necessarily related to the discovery issue, which is a list of Wright’s alleged BTC holdings. If the court does acknowledge and accept the presented facts, the discovery abuse would still be “uncured,” because the court is unable to determine how much Bitcoin Wright actually owns.Judge Bloom says that Wright did not make a good faith effort to follow the discovery orders and must pay the Kleiman estate’s legal fees. In November 2019, the Kleiman estate had submitted a motion demanding that legal expenses of $658,000 be covered. Wright’s attorneys responded by asking the courts to deny the request because they claimed that the attorney fees were “unreasonable.”The judge has now given Wright until February 3 to notify the court if a “mysterious bonded courier” appears with the final key slice so he can gain access to his alleged BTC holdings.The judge has also questioned Wright’s claim that the courier will be delivering the slice this month.Posted In: Altcoins, People     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

171,CryptoSlate,Crypto markets rally as Bitcoin flashes bullish signs; is altseason upon us?,Cole Petersen,1578715200.0,"Bitcoin’s uptrend throughout the first ten days of 2020 has allowed most major altcoins to put some distance between their current prices and their recent lows. Many of these altcoins have been underperforming BTC, although this may soon change as the aggregated crypto market begins incurring some major momentum.Analysts are now even going as far as to say that multiple altcoins that are rallying today could be the primary factors that help lead Bitcoin higher in the near-term.Crypto Markets Surge as Bitcoin Shows Signs of Starting Another RallyCurrently, multiple major cryptocurrencies have been able to clock massive gains, with Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV – two controversial BTC hard forks – surging 10 percent and 27 percent respectively.They aren’t the only digital assets that have been able to post large gains today, as Litecoin has been able to climb just under 9 percent, while EOS has jumped nearly 7 percent.These altcoins are currently climbing on the backdrop of Bitcoin’s recent bullishness, as the cryptocurrency’s buyers were able to absorb significant overnight selling pressure that nearly forced BTC beneath its key support at $7,700.Buyer’s strong defense of this level allowed it to climb back above $8,000, and the crypto is now attempting to break above $8,100.Jonny Moe, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, concisely noted that it is “go time” for Bitcoin, pointing to a chart that shows the resistance it is currently attempting to break above.Image Courtesy of Jonny MoeWill Altcoins Help Fuel the Next BTC Rally? Historically, Bitcoin leads the aggregated markets on both uptrend and downtrends, with smaller cryptocurrencies closely tracking its price action and following its lead.This time, however, one analyst believes that BTC’s next rally to $8,500 could be fueled by the bullishness currently being seen amongst major altcoins.Loma, another popular cryptocurrency analyst, spoke about this in a tweet, telling his followers that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if BTC follows Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin’s lead. He noted:“If BCH and LTC is leading the market, I wouldn’t be surprised if BTC follows to about $8,500.”It does appear that Bitcoin is struggling to break above this resistance level, however, and any strong rejection here could lead it back into the $7,000 region, subsequently halting the rallies seen by multiple major altcoins.Posted In: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

It, however, still remains in a firm uptrend while looking at its 30-day price action, and technical analysis may suggest that it is primed for significantly further bullishness.One factor that could provide some drag to any near-term bullishness is the fact that users on the blockchain platform have fallen off a cliff over the past few months, even though its transaction volume has been able to incur some steady growth.EOS Sees Stable Transaction Volume, But Lack of Users Remains a Big ProblemEOS is one of many so-called “Ethereum killers” that was launched in an attempt to provide a decentralized blockchain platform that offers scalability to projects looking to build on top of it.The ongoing crypto winter, however, has dried up the decentralized application (Dapp) markets, leaving only a handful of active projects that tend to favor Ethereum over the rest of the competing platforms.This is emblematic while looking at EOS’ user data, which has declined significantly over the past few months, diving from nearly 110k users in October of 2019, to just over 10k users presently – according to data from Dapp Review.Image Courtesy of Dapp ReviewInterestingly, it should also be noted that EOS transactions have been climbing over the same period of time, expressing what appears to be an inverse correlation with usership.Image Courtesy of Dapp ReviewLack of Active Users May Not Stop the Crypto from Starting a Massive RallyAlthough fundamental factors like this may spell trouble for an asset’s long-term value, in the near-term it appears that all price action is being driven solely by technical factors, which is a good thing for EOS.Scott Melker — a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter who goes by the pseudonym “The Wolf of All Streets” — explained in a recent tweet that EOS is one of the only major cryptocurrencies that currently appears to be expressing notable bullishness due to breaking its downtrend.

173,CryptoSlate,Analyst: Chainlink could soon enter a massive uptrend as LINK outperforms markets,Cole Petersen,1578532560.0,"Chainlink (LINK) has been one of the best performing major cryptocurrencies of the past year, setting fresh all-time highs in 2019 while most major altcoins were still facing immense bearishness that spilled over from the 2018 market crash.LINK’s ability to post a parabolic surge in 2019 was not fleeting either, and although it did retrace about half of these gains, it was still able to end the year up 500 percent from where it started.This immense bullishness may be far from being over, as the cryptocurrency is now showing signs of potentially being in the early stages of another parabolic rally that allows it to post some significant and noteworthy gains, and there are a few key levels that analysts are closely watching.Chainlink Outperforms Bitcoin and Other Major CryptocurrenciesAt the time of writing, Chainlink is trading up at its current price of $2.15, which marks a massive climb from its daily lows of $2.05 that was set around yesterday at this time.Since the start of 2020, LINK, like most other cryptocurrencies, has been caught within a firm uptrend that has allowed it to climb from lows of $1.70.Today, however, Bitcoin has led the aggregated crypto market to incur some downside, with BTC dropping 4 percent while many major altcoins post losses of 3 percent or more.Currently, LINK is trading up 4.65 percent against BTC and 4.06 percent against ETH. At the moment, it does not appear that the instability currently being expressed by the aggregated markets is enough to phase Chainlink’s buyers.Could Link Soon Enter a Fresh Parabolic Phase? One Analyst Thinks So LINK has incurred multiple parabolic rallies of varying sizes throughout 2019, and Bitcoin Jack – a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter – believes that the crypto could be gearing up for another big movement.He explained in a recent tweet that its strong bounce from its BTC support level could mean that it will soon revisit its multi-month highs at roughly 0.0004 BTC, marking a large climb from its current price of 0.00026 BTC.“It’s always good to see some engulfing action after interaction with your support level. $LINK bounced 15 percent from support, hopefully it’s the sign of strength we are looking for,” he explained while pointing to a chart marked with the crypto’s support and resistance levels.Image Courtesy of Bitcoin JackChainlink does have a tendency to start parabolic trends independent of both Bitcoin and the aggregated crypto market, which means that this next rally could come about regardless of whether or not bulls are able to push BTC higher in the near-term.   Chainlink 3 Feb at 9:04 pm UTC$2.15  0.41%Chainlink, currently ranked #17 by market cap, is up 0.41% over the past 24 hours.

174,CryptoSlate,The Stellar Development Foundation received 98% of the XLM inflation payouts,Priyeshu Garg,1578450060.0,"Out of 5.48 billion XLM that has been paid out as part of Stellar’s inflation distribution process, 98 percent has gone to the Stelar Development Foundation. And even though the foundation burned most of the funds they received this way to reduce the inequities in the network, none of it actually went to its intended use—community projects.Stellar’s broken inflation distribution processUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which use the new supply of coins brought on by their inflation to reward the miners, Stellar reserves a part of its newly issued supply for its non-profit foundation. However, the Stellar Development foundation seems to be everything but non-profit, as recent research showed that it failed to spend the funds it received on community projects.According to a recent CoinMetrics report, Stellar’s monetary inflation process issued new tokens at a set rate of 1 percent per year. The surplus of the tokens would be divided among “inflation destination” accounts, which would receive a share of the inflation pool proportional to their total balance. The distribution of the inflation would be decided via a weekly vote, where each inflation destination account that got voted by at least 0.05 percent of the supply would receive the new issuance.Jeb McCaleb, the co-founder of Stellar, said that this process was created to “give people incentive to collaborate and decide on how network rewards are allocated.” However, after almost a year of deliberation, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) decided to phase out the inflation distribution process in October 2019, saying it failed to support the development and growth of the ecosystem.The Stellar community saw none of the money it was promisedHowever, CoinMetrics found that out of the four years the inflation process was running, only 23 unique recipients got to share the 5.482 billion XLM as the designated inflation destination accounts. These recipients included some of the largest XLM holders on the market, including the Stellar Development Foundation, cryptocurrency exchanges, community projects, and inflation pools (individual inflation destination accounts pooled together to claim more rewards).However, only one of these accounts actually benefited from the inflation distribution.According to the report, 98 percent of all the inflation payouts from October 2015 to October 2019 went to the Stellar Development Foundation.Image showing the XLM inflation distribution from 2015 to 2019 (Source: CoinMetrics)CoinMetrics explained that this is most likely a result of two factors. With the Stellar Development Foundation controlling 80 percent of the total XLM circulating supply, it has designated itself as an inflation destination and has therefore received the largest part of the distributed inflation.The second factor that could explain SDF’s massive inflation balance is the fact that it had always participated in the inflation process. As Stellar didn’t see its popularity grow until 2017, the SDF had a 2-year head start where it was among a handful of participants in the inflation process.Despite doing its best to remedy the inequities the inflation process caused in the network by distributing 340 million XLM, or around $16.7 million, to network development and growth since November, SDF actually worsened the position of the Stellar community. With only 834,000 XLM, or around $41,000, having gone to community projects so far, it’s clear that the biggest loser this year was the Stellar community.Posted In: Stellar, Altcoins, Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

175,CryptoSlate,"HEX origin address emptied out, almost $7 million withdrawn",Priyeshu Garg,1578387600.0,"Around $7 million worth of ETH has been withdrawn from an address associated with the HEX cryptocurrency after weeks of speculation that it was headed towards an exit scam. The funds were transferred on Jan. 6 through 36 separate transactions, with each one withdrawing exactly 1,337 ETH, worth around $192,500.It took 36 transactions to empty out the address holding all investments in HEXHEX, one of the most notorious cryptocurrency projects in the industry, seems to be going through a textbook exit dump. What began as rumors and hearsay on Reddit just a couple of weeks ago has now turned into cold hard evidence.According to data from Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan.io, the main address associated with HEX has been almost completely emptied out. There were 36 outgoing transactions from the address on Jan. 6, each one transferring exactly 1,337 ETH from the address. With Ethereum’s price hovering around $144 at press time, that makes each of the 36 outgoing transactions worth over $192,500.Transaction details about one of the 36 times 1,337 ETH was withdrawn from HEX addressTransaction details about one of the 36 times 1,337 ETH was withdrawn from HEX address. (Source: Etherscan.io)And now, with almost $7 million worth of ETH gone from the address, it’s beginning to look a lot like the exit scam HEX investors have been warned about weeks ago. None of the transactions went out to the same address, meaning that all of the tokens people have invested in HEX have been scattered around.Big claims, bigger lossesFew cryptocurrency projects have managed to gain the notoriety HEX has. Just over one month old, the cryptocurrency seems to be equally as hated as other, much bigger scams such as BitConnect or OneCoin.According to CoinGecko, HEX is down 93.6 percent from its all-time high.Launched on Ethereum via a Bitcoin UTXO snapshot on Dec. 2, HEX claimed it can “do over 10,000x returns in under 2.5 years.”These outlandish claims, including one that HEX is “designed to increase in value faster than anything else in history,” all came from Richard Heart. Heart, who calls himself a blockchain thought leader, managed to attract a lot of attention, receiving over 33,000 ETH in investment.However, investments in HEX looked more like donations to his personal address than a token sale, as all of them were held in a single Ethereum address Heart claimed was impossible to access.Then, from Dec. 12 to Dec. 23, more than $115,000 worth of ETH was withdrawn from the address, leading many to suspect that it was the beginning of an exit scam. While most publications avoided calling the incident an exit scam, the overwhelming sentiment among the crypto community was that it was, without a doubt, a rip-off.With the address holding all the tokens invested in HEX now almost completely empty and the HEX team remaining silent on the issue, it may be safe to assume the notorious project is in its final throes.Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, Analysis, Scams, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

176,CryptoSlate,Charles Hoskinson says this will be the decade of Cardano,Priyeshu Garg,1578358800.0,"Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, believes that this will be the decade of Cardano. With a successful incentivized testnet launch and over 500 stake pools already launched, Hoskinson said that Cardano was ramping up its efforts to commercialize the tech they’ve been developing for the past three years.2020 will be the most important year for Cardano yetAfter successfully deploying the incentivized testnet for the Shelley era of Cardano, IOHK seems to have gone into overdrive when it comes to developing its ambitious blockchain project. With over 500 staking pools already deployed on the incentivized testnet, Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, believes major success is just around the corner for Cardano.In a YouTube AMA on Jan. 3, 2020, Hoskinson gave one of his lengthy updates about the current state of Cardano and future plans for IOHK, Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo. Hoskinson said the date of the AMA had a special significance—it coincided with Bitcoin‘s 11th birthday. He noted that the world’s first cryptocurrency was very important both for him and for Cardano, as it gave birth to a whole new industry that’s already changing the world:He said later in the AMA:“Bitcoin is a gateway drug to our industry. We have to remember where we came from—we came from Bitcoin.”According to Hoskinson, the past decade brought so much fundamental change that it’s quite possible the next one will end with things like commercial quantum computers and private space travel becoming the norm.However, the biggest change will be brought on by cryptocurrencies, he said, as it will bring about changes not only in industries such as journalism and funding but also be a driving force that will boost the economies of developing countries and bring their people out of poverty.Fundamental changes to the world won’t bypass Cardano, either. Hoskinson said that the Cardano team plans on reaching unprecedented success in the next ten years.“This is the decade of Cardano,” he said in the AMA, adding that serious work is being done to make Cardano the most predominant force in the cryptocurrency space by the end of the 2020s.Hoskinson believes that IOHK’s obsession with getting the technology right is the right approach to ensure future development. From there, he said, they only have to make sure that the technology they developed has the right commercial utilization. With a platform that’s built to handle billions of transactions each day, Hoskinson believes that achieving over a billion users isn’t all that far-fetched.“Cardano is a platform for solutions”One of IOHK’s main focuses will be to make sure that the tech they have developed so far and continue developing in the next decade has the right commercial utilization. Without a useful product, the blockchain itself and all the research that has gone into it would have been for nothing, he explained.Luckily, IOHK has a very good understanding of what needs to be done to build a functioning, global, interconnected system. The reason why both Hoskinson and IOHK seem so optimistic about the future of their product is the fact that they have intentionally made it slow and simple.He explained, adding that Cardano employed incentives in its testnet in order to facilitate the growth of the network:“The reason why Bitcoin was so successful is that Satoshi created a simple system with great incentives.”However, he noted that despite the continuous research that has gone into incentives, Cardano is not an academic project.All of the efforts that have gone into perfecting staking and incentives were part of IOHK’s “aggressive” commercialization of Cardano. It’s a commercial project first and foremost, Hoskinson noted, explaining that Cardano was a platform for solutions.Hoskinson also took the time to comment on the rivalry between blockchain projects. He said that the division in the crypto industry benefits nobody, as he believes there can be no single solution to the problems cryptocurrencies went on to solve. There won’t be a single global cryptocurrency or one blockchain to rule them all, Hoskinson said. Instead, he believes the future will be an internet of interconnected blockchains and value where everyone will have to work with each other.“We either succeed together or fail together,” he said.Major releases and important projects coming in 2020 for CardanoWhen it comes to concrete announcements about upcoming releases, Hoskinson was reluctant to give any specific dates or information. However, he shared some of the plans IOHK and the Cardano Foundation have for the first half of 2020, revealing that the company has only ramped up its efforts since the deployment of the incentivized testnet for Shelley.January alone will bring a lot of updates to Cardano. Hoskinson said that apart from the Haskell wallet backend, the Haskell Shelley testnet will also be released in the following weeks. The mainnet for Shelley, while scheduled to be released “soon,” will most likely go live sometime in February.The first quarter of 2020 will also be a busy one of the Plutus team at IOHK—Hoskinson said that they would be “dialing up” the Plutus team and ramping up their work on Goguen. The goal of this operation will be to make it easier for people to write and deploy dapps on Cardano in the following months.The most important thing that will happen this year will be the development and deployment of succinct non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs SNARKs. Sonic, Cardano’s own SNARK deloped in 2018, will be one of the main topics discussed in the upcoming Cardano summit in Edinborough at the end of the month. With an entire team dedicated only to implementing SNARKs and Sonic, there will definitely be a lot to discuss.There are new papers being written within IOHK, Hoskinson said, revealing that most of them will focus on interoperability. More information about these papers and the research that has gone into them will be announced soon, he added.Another topic that will be important for Cardano development in the following year will be private computation. Hoskinson said that private smart contracts could have a wide variety of uses, especially in things like medical records, which is why Cardano wants to have a working product as soon as possible.To keep the Cardano community in touch with what’s going on behind the scenes, product managers will publish regular, monthly updates where they’ll go into detail about what’s been going on both in IOHK and the Cardano Foundation. The first product manager update most likely won’t be published this month, he said but will be regular starting in February.With the first draft of the rebranding report from McCann Dublin expected by the end of the month, Cardano seems to have taken its commercialization promises seriously.

177,CryptoSlate,Report: Bitcoin and crypto adoption surging despite bear market,Priyeshu Garg,1578138720.0,"According to the latest Coin Metrics report, 2019 has been a record-breaking year when it comes to crypto adoption. Addresses with a balance of at least $10 increased for most of the major cryptocurrencies, as did their prices, showing that the retail market was thriving despite pessimistic predictions.Coin Metrics state of the market report finds the crypto market is thrivingLast year was supposed to be a breaking year for Bitcoin. The world’s largest cryptocurrency turned 10 in 2019, leading many to believe that such a milestone would bring much-needed stability to the market.But, most cryptocurrencies took a major hit this year—in a matter of days, dozens of coins saw almost 50 percent of their value wiped out. And while this was a heavy blow for traders and investors, it was the optimism about the future of the market that suffered the most. Those predicting an unprecedented bull market were suddenly singing a different tune, saying the market was set for a bloody winter.However, when reviewing the entire year, everything doesn’t seem so bleak anymore. According to the latest Coin Metrics State of the Network review, the crypto market is actually doing better than ever.The report took a look back at how the major crypto assets performed over 2019 across four categories—valuation, usage and adoption, economics, and security. While most of these categories showed that the market was thriving, one particular metric stood out.More people own cryptocurrencies than ever beforeTo measure the number of potential blockchain users, Coin Metrics took a look at the number of active addresses across 18 of the top-performing cryptocurrencies on the market. The report defined active addresses as unique addresses active in the network that day, either as a recipient or originator of a ledger change and found that they increased for most of the major crypto assets over 2019.Chart showing annual percent change in the number of active addresses across 18 top-performing cryptocurrencies. (Source: Coin Metrics)However, as the overall number of active addresses doesn’t show the actual number of users of a blockchain, but rather the maximum number of users, it’s not the best metric that illustrates just how much the crypto market has grown.Instead, the Coin Metrics report looked at the number of addresses with a balance of at least $10 as a better measure of the number of total “retail” holders of an asset. The company explained in the report:“$10 is a somewhat arbitrary number but is a small enough balance to be considered an average, non-institutional investor, and large enough to not be dust (amounts smaller than the fee required to move them).”The huge increase in the number of addresses with a balance of at least $10 is a fantastic sign for the market, as it shows crypto adoption is growing.The report found that BTC and ETH both have significantly more addresses with a balance of at least $10 than all other major cryptocurrencies—ETH has nearly twice as many as any other asset and BTC has almost four times as many as ETH.Only BSV, XRP, and ZEC saw decreases, with BSV being particularly odd since it saw a large increase in active addresses of over 600%.Chart showing annual percent change in the number of addresses with more than $10.

178,CryptoSlate,IOTA’s 15-hour downtime gets it on the comedy section on the CryptoCurrency subreddit,Priyeshu Garg,1577683020.0,"The IOTA network couldn’t process transactions for more than 15 hours after a software bug caused a “corrupt ledger state.” While IOTA’s developers managed to resolve the issue, the company’s response to the issue made it front-page news on the comedy section in the CryptoCurrency subreddit.IOTA team resolves a minor bug that left the network unable to process transactionsUsers that wanted to send funds through IOTA were out of luck on Sunday, as the network was down most of the day. The ambitious blockchain project, which has been struggling with both adoption and a slow development process, encountered a bug on Sunday morning that prevented transactions from being recorded.The issue with the mainnet lasted well over 15 hours, with countless users on Reddit and Twitter complaining about not being able to use the network. When the first complaints about the network being down began surfacing, the founder of IOTA, David Sønstebø responded to the rumors saying that the network was experiencing a “minor bug.”He called for IOTA users to “display some gratitude” as IOTA developers have dropped “everything” to resolve the issue as soon as possible.Soon after, IOTA developer Gal Rogozinski released a mainnet upgrade that resolved the issue that handicapped the network. According to his GitHub post, the IOTA Reference Implementation (IRI) node failed to account for transactions shared between two bundles. The issue was resolved in the v1.8.3 release, the developer said.Everything’s working except the only thing that mattersThe news about IOTA being down for more than 15 hours spread like wildfire through the crypto community. However, it wasn’t the bug itself that led many to criticize the network, but the way the IOTA team handled the issue.Sønstebø categorized the bug as “minor,” saying the biggest problem was the fact that it happened during the holidays. He said:“It’s really no different from periods where the network has been spammed and thus real tx slowed down significantly.”Dave de Fijter, the lead developer at IOTA, said that the tangle itself was working when asked about the bug, adding that the value transactions are the only thing that is “not confirming.”These reactions earned IOTA a place in the comedy section in the CryptoCurrency subreddit. The reactions to the post were mixed, to say the least, with half of the Reddit community ridiculing IOTA for handling the issue poorly, while the other half defended the team and called for the topic to be removed from the “Comedy” section.“I used to be interested in Iota, but I stopped following it because of the attitudes of the devs,” a Reddit user wrote, echoing the sentiment of many others that have joined the discussion. Some have even pointed out that the downtime the network saw showed that IOTA can’t compete with Bitcoin or Ethereum, both of which have had a “100% uptime” since their inception.Posted In: IOTA, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

179,CryptoSlate,Is this the beginning of the HEX exit? 800 ETH withdrawn and sent to Bitfinex,Priyeshu Garg,1577432580.0,"Around 800 ETH has been withdrawn from an address associated with the HEX cryptocurrency, leading many to suspect it was the beginning of an exit scam. While there are more than 46,000 ETH left to withdraw, all of the funds are held in a single address that Richard Heart, the founder of HEX, says is controlled by an “anonymous” person.Suspicions rise as $100,000 worth of ETH withdrawn from HEX accountFollowing the 2017 ICO boom, one might think that the days of projects claiming gargantuan returns are long gone. However, a new crypto project emerged earlier this month that proved, once again, that there’s no stopping crypto scams.On Dec. 2, Richard Heart, a blockchain thought leader and cryptocurrency investor, launched a new cryptocurrency, dubbed HEX. Launched on Ethereum via a Bitcoin UTXO snapshot, the project claims it can “do over 10,000x returns in under 2.5 years.”Heart’s outlandish claims, including one that HEX is “designed to increase in value faster than anything else in history,” managed to attract a lot of attention, receiving over 33,000 ETH in donations.These donations were automatically “transformed” to HEX and held in a single Ethereum address. And now, around $100,000 worth of ETH was moved from that address and transferred to crypto exchanges, leading many to suspect that it was the beginning of an exit scam.The easiest get-rich-quick scheme in cryptoMany analysts, such as Goldman Sats, argued that HEX is far beyond a Ponzi or pyramid scheme. According to the analysts, the way HEX was created gives Heart ownership of almost half of the tokens through something called the “Origin Address,” which receives a copy of all bonus payments in the protocol.Data from Etherscan.io has shown that 797 ETH was withdrawn from the origin address and addresses associated with it. The first transaction happened on Dec. 12, when 95 ETH, or around $12,000, were withdrawn. A day later, another 100 ETH was withdrawn. Throughout the week, 500, 75, and 27 more ETH were withdrawn from the same address.According to several Reddit users, the 500 ETH that was withdrawn on Dec. 23 immediately went into a Bitfinex address to be liquidated. The same address now holds $6.25 worth of ETH.And while there’s around 46,000 more ETH left on the origin address, it’s still unknown who controls it. The overwhelming sentiment among Reddit users seems to be that this is, without a doubt, the beginning of an exit scam. However, most users also believe the majority of the funds in the origin address was deposited by Heart and the rest of the HEX team to make it seem like there is a continued demand for the token.Posted In: Bitfinex, Altcoins, Analysis, Scams     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

181,CryptoSlate,"VeChain hack aftermath: CFO resigns, network to vote on burning stolen tokens",Priyeshu Garg,1577071680.0,"Following the theft of $6.5 million worth of VET tokens from its buyback wallet, blockchain platform VeChain announced that it will be taking several measures to ensure the network’s safety. The CFO took full responsibility for the attack and resigned from his position, while the company said the final decision as to what to do with the stolen funds will be left to the community.Patching things up after a 1.1 billion token theftVeChain, an enterprise-focused blockchain ecosystem, has announced that it will be implementing measures that will make the network more secure and resistant to hacks. The announcement, published on Medium on Dec. 22, was made in the aftermath of the biggest theft the network has seen.Just over a week ago, unidentified hackers stole 1.1 billion VET tokens, worth around $6.5 million at press time, from the company’s buyback wallets. At the time, the Singapore-based company said the hack was most likely a result of a human error and that it was working on improving the protocols that enabled such an error to occur.The company’s quick response to the issue included working with exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, Bitfinex, and Bittrex to blacklist all addresses associated with the hack, which prevented the hackers from dumping the coins on the market. With a fixed supply of 86.7 billion tokens, losing 1 percent of its circulating supply would bring VeChain to its knees.One of the measures proposed by the company was completely blocking the address controlled by the hacker. VeChain released VeChainThor v1.1.5 two days after the hack, which allowed the network’s Authority Masternode to vote on the issue.“Currently, 469 addresses owned by the thief have been blocked by the Authority Masternodes, which froze about 727 million VETs,” VeChain sad in the announcement.To burn or not to burn?The VeChain community will get to make the final decision on the destiny of the blocked addresses. All of VET token stakeholders will be able to vote on whether or not to implement the blocklist introduced in VeChainThor v1.1.5 patch.If the community was to vote on burning the addresses, the 727 million stolen VET tokens would be burnt and forever subtracted from both the total and the circulating supply, VeChain said in its Dec. 22 statement.With most expecting the community to vote yes on the burn, the company is set to take a heavy financial hit. In a bid to preserve its reputation and dampen the financial blow, the company’s chief financial officer Jay Zhang will be stepping down from his role.

182,CryptoSlate,"MINDOL (MIN) skyrocketed over 28x recently, but what is it?",Ali Martinez,1576663140.0,"Over the last two months, MINDOL (MIN), an Ethereum-based token aiming to promote the Japanese “geek culture,” skyrocketed over 28x. The sudden rise in has the crypto community wondering whether this crypto is a legit project or another “pump-and-dump” scheme.What is MINDOL?MINDOL claims to be the new currency for the world of “subculture market.” The project was born to revive the Japanese subculture worldwide, commonly referred to as “geek culture” or “otaku culture.” Its main objective is to promote the idea of “Cool Japan” on a global scale and help the local government in its ambition to reconstruct the Japanese economy.According to the project’s white paper:“MINDOL Project will be creating new content in the fields of “Cool Japan” – subculture and pop cultures such as animation, movies, games, cartoons, and music. In addition, we will manage and operate the project safely and securely, using blockchain technology.”By building a framework that generates world-class competitive content within different fields, Fumihiro Fukuhara, the head of MINDOL, believes that the project will succeed and establish itself as a highly profitable business.The exponential surgeMINDOL raise notoriety among around the crypto community after entering a massive bull rally that has seen its price increase over 28x. MIN was hovering at $0.17 around late-October and by Dec. 16 it hit an all-time high of $4.82. With a market cap of $708 million, the Japan-based cryptocurrency was able to make it to the No. 17 spot on CoinMarketCap’s crypto rankings.MINDOL (MIN) price chart by CoinMarketCapThe sudden surge appears to be related to Bibox’s announcement that it would be listing MINDOL to its retail platform. The integration provides market access to MIN for millions of retail investors. They can now deposit, withdraw, and trade this ERC-20 token on the Chinese crypto giant platform.Although Bibox’s listing adds certain credibility to the project, many observers have dismissed it. According to Bobby Ong, CEO at CoinGecko, MIN is an “absolute shitcoin” that ranks No. 2906 among all cryptos on his platform. Meanwhile, Satoshi Watch called it “nonsense fraud” without any development behind it.It remains to be seen whether this cryptocurrency will be able to keep the gains posted in the last few months and back up its claims such as sponsoring a Hollywood movie, dubbed “To Do & Die,” scheduled to be released worldwide in 2020.

184,CryptoSlate,Cardano’s Shelley testnet has ten times more staking pools than EOS and Tron,Priyeshu Garg,1576467000.0,"Cardano celebrated the launch of the Shelley incentivized testnet, as it debuted with hundreds of pools and over 2.6 billion ADA staked. The testnet currently has 281 staking pools, which is 10 times more than EOS’s 21 and Tron’s 26.Incentivized testnet shows promising results for CardanoAfter months of anticipation, the incentivized testnet for the Shelley era of Cardano finally went live. With a week-long test run between a trial balance check and the real network snapshot, the company and its team were focused on creating a solid foundation for testing out the network’s staking protocol.Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, Cardano’s parent company, said that the team hopes the incentivized network’s 1000 pool hosting capability will be fulfilled. And while the number might have sounded a bit too ambitious at the time, the incentivized testnet for Shelly debuted with metrics that show that it’s not just possible, but closer than ever.According to IOHK, less than 24 hours after the staking pool setup was enabled on the incentivized testnet, more than 120 pools were onboarded.However, that number more than doubled since Dec. 15, as data from ADAPools has shown that there are 281 staking pools at press time. If the number of pools keeps its growth rate, the network could reach its equilibrium with 1000 pools sooner than expected.Cardano beats Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, and Tron by number of staking pools and rewardsWhile still in its infancy, the Shelley era of Cardano show has the potential to outperform its older and more established PoS competitors. According to a tweet from Cardanians, a community-led Cardano news outlet, the Shelley incentivized testnet boasts 10 times more staking pools than both EOS and Tron. Bitcoin and Ethereum both have around 10 pools according to the tweet, which is 28 times less than what Shelley onboarded in just two days.According to data from PoolTool, there is currently more than 2.6 billion ADA staked on the incentivized testnet for Shelley. With a circulating supply of around 25.9 billion, that means around 10 percent of all available ADA is currently staked on the testnet.That number looks even more impressive when compared to Tron. With a circulating supply of 66.7 billion and 8 billion TRX staked, only around 12 percent of the available tokens are staked.Cardano could surpass some of its competitors with its hefty staking rewards. According to the company’s rewards calculator, delegating 100,000 ADA, worth just under $3,600 at press time, would earn the user around 7.1 percent, or around $257, annually.Calculator showing rewards for delegating 100,000 ADA. (Source: Cardano)Running an entire stake pool is much more profitable according to the calculator. Delegating the same amount of ADA, while retaining 1 percent of the total stake in the pool and taking 10 percent of the rewards as an operator, could earn the pool more than 90 percent of its stake annually.Calculator showing rewards for running a stake pool with 100,000 ADA delegated. (Source: Cardano)As the testnet progresses, the ranking of the staking pools won’t be based solely on their performance, as it will transition to a desirability-based ranking.

186,CryptoSlate,"With a 90% YTD loss, Algorand is the worst performing major crypto of the year",Priyeshu Garg,1576031160.0,"Algorand (ALGO) is the worst-performing major crypto of the year, having dropped more than 90 percent since January 2019. The company’s token sales and ambitious decentralization goals drastically reduced the community’s confidence in the project, as many criticized its overvalued market capitalization.Ambitious Algorand soars too highAlgorand, a Boston-based blockchain company created to improve blockchain decentralization, has been making the news this year, partly for its ambitious token sales and partly for the widely contested inaccuracies published by the company.Earlier in June, the company completed its inaugural token auction which sold out in under four hours due to oversubscribed demand. The company raised over $60 million in a token sale on CoinList, in addition to the $66 million it raised in 2018 from major venture capital firms such as Union Square Ventures and Pillar Venture Capital.With each token being sold for $2.4, and a capped supply of 10 billion coins, many criticized Algorand’s self-valuation, calling it overly ambitious. If the coin was to keep roughly the same price as it had in the latest sale, Algorand’s $24 billion market cap would make it the third-largest coin in the world.However, it seems that the company has soared too high with its valuation, as the promising coin has become the absolute worst performer of the year. Out of the top 200 coins by market capitalization, Algorand lost more than 90 percent of its value according to data from CoinCodex.Algorand’s price drop from inaugural token sale in June. Source: ALGOIs Algorand guilty of false advertising?Algorand has been on the receiving end of a lot of criticism for the better part of the year. Back in June, analysis from ICO Drops found that while the hype around Algogrand was high, so was its risk rate.It became one of the most popular projects of the year thanks to the publicity of its founder, Turing Award and Gödel Prize-winner Silvio Micali. The company aimed to improve blockchain decentralization by utilizing the Byzantine Agreement protocol. Its consensus algorithm, similar to a traditional proof-of-stake one, requires minimal computation in order to qualify as an honest block producer on the network.But, the company’s laissez-faire approach to selecting new block generators and validators, in which it assumes that 2/3 of block producers are honest, wasn’t well-received by the crypto community. With no network incentives or any kind of financial rewards going to block generators, honest nodes could easily leave the network that gives them no monetary support.The diminishing trust the crypto community had in Algorand was further reduced when it was uncovered that the company shared incorrect information in its promotional material. Earlier this year, the company claimed its network handled more than 50,000 transactions in less than a month since its launch, saying it was equivalent to 6 months of transactions on the Bitcoin network.The information shared on the company’s website and Twitter account was later repeated by Steven Kokinos, Algorand’s CEO, who added that they processed “2-3 months of Ethereum transactions” in 30 days.While both the company and Kokinos apologized for the mistake, saying it was unintentional, the crypto community seemed to see it as one red flag too many. Not even the company’s buyback policy, which offers a 90 percent return on the coin within a year if the clearing price if above $1.00, managed to repair the damage done.At press time, Algo is trading at around $0.27, a mere shadow of its $3.6 ATH and $2.4 inaugural sale price.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis, Price Watch     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

187,CryptoSlate,Big traders on Binance panic tanking Matic’s price by almost 75%,Priyeshu Garg,1575955800.0,"The digital token of Ethereum-based payments company Matic lost almost 75 percent of its value in a matter of minutes after two weeks of massive appreciation. While the matter is still being investigated, both Matic and Binance said that it wasn’t a pump and dump scheme, but a result of a panic cycle caused by “a number of big traders.”Matic’s price flash-crashes by more than 70 percentMATIC, one of the first tokens that were launched on Binance’s IEO platform, Binance Launchpad, has had a turbulent few weeks that culminated with a brutal slashing of its value. Traders awoke on Dec. 10 to find that the coin had lost 75 percent of its value, dropping from $0.04 to around $0.01 in a matter of hours.MATIC Price ChartThis was a hard blow to traders as Matic has been on an upward trajectory for the past few weeks, jumping from around $0.013 to $0.042 in just three weeks.The drastic drop in price caused a stir in the crypto community, as many traders and analysts reported that it coincided with a massive move of MATIC from the Matic Network Foundation to Binance. After reports suggested the Foundation moved 15 percent of MATIC’s circulating supply, the crypto community was up in arms accusing the foundation and its parent company of a pump-and-dump scheme.What does the on-chain data say?IntoTheBlock, a crypto data platform, shared some interesting on-chain data about MATIC, including:14 addresses control 97.6 percent of the circulating supplyOne address owns 55.6 percent or $126 million USDTop 6 addresses own 96 percent$5mm were moved yesterday in transactions greater than $100k USDMATIC on-chain data (Source: IntoTheBlock)Trader FUD could be what decimated Matic’s priceHowever, the information that almost 1.5 billion MATIC has been moved in the past two months was quickly debunked. Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, weighed in on the matter on Twitter, saying that the drop in price couldn’t have come from Matic. Zhao tweeted:“Our team is still investigating the data, but it’s already clear that the MATIC team has nothing to do with it. A number of big traders panicked, causing a cycle. Going to be a tough call on how much an exchange should interfere with people’s trading.”Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder and COO of the Matic Network, said this looked like someone tried to profit on the meteoric rise Matic saw recently, adding that the company is “unfazed” by market manipulations. Nailwal tweeted:“Just woke up to this nightmare due to a distress call by someone It will be clear very shortly that we are not behind this, as some FUD accounts are trying to insinuate We will post a detailed analysis and we will come out stronger than ever from this evident manipulation”The company explained that the move of 250 million tokens to Binance as part of its October unlock. According to the company’s blog post, all unlocked investor tokens will be allocated towards staking, either as staking rewards or to be staked.The Foundation’s tokens are still intact, the company said on Twitter and thanked its community for its support in times of distress. George Cao, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMax, said that the Matic Network team wasn’t behind it as the same thing happened on several other projects on Binance. Cao said:“We are willing to help in all possible ways. Let us know if you need anything. I personally don’t believe it’s the team since this happened to many projects on binance at the almost same time.”While Matic has a tough period ahead, the coin managed to recover a large part of its value. The struggling coin saw its value rise by more than 42 percent since its crash this morning and is currently trading at around $0.020.

190,CryptoSlate,"Horizen (ZEN) ranked first by active nodes, while Bitcoin (BTC) second",Ali Martinez,1575091140.0,"A renowned analyst is making a compelling case for ranking cryptocurrencies. Instead of taking into account their market capitalization, he puts emphasis on the number of nodes instead.CoinMarketCap rankings are “nonsense”Aat de Kwaasteniet, a former electrical designer at Vialis, explained in a Medium post that the way CoinMarketCap ranks cryptocurrencies is “highly questionable.” He specified that the price of a given crypto should not be the only factor to consider when raking these assets.Under CoinMarketCap’s gauge, the higher the price of a digital asset in combination with the higher the number of tokens in circulation, the better positioned they would be. Kwaasteniet maintains that the industry puts a lot of weight on a “high market cap quotation,” but this value is “very fictitious.”Kwaasteniet explained:“Let’s say, John launches and cryptocurrency and calls it JohnDoeCoin. He sets up the blockchain in such a way that at the beginning there are 100 million JohnDoe’s (the so-called pre-mined tokens). Then, he goes to his friend William and asks if he wants to buy one JohnDoe from him for €10. According to the market cap definition, JohnDoeCoin now has a market cap of €1 billion and CoinMarketCap ranks it around the 10th place.”The analyst believes that this way of raking cryptocurrency is “nonsense.” He suggests that instead, cryptos should be ranked based on the “nodes/peers that are active in the network and are involved in checking/approving the transactions.”Rankings by number of nodesKwaasteniet stressed that for some tokens the only data available was provided on their own blockchain explorer. But, not all nodes in the network are counted in most cases.On Nov. 24, for instance, the top 10 cryptocurrencies by the number of nodes/peers that were connected to their networks were: Horizen (ZEN), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Zcoin (XZC), PAC Global (PAC), Polis (POLIS), Dash (DASH), Zilliqa (ZIL), DigitalNote (XDN), and Gulden (NLG).Cryptocurrency Rankings by Active Nodes. Source: MediumIt is worth noting that this list represents a snapshot of how many nodes were connected on Nov. 24. And, these values can vary at any time. Kwaasteniet believes that this way of ranking cryptocurrencies is “fairer” and serves the purpose of Bitcoin’s developer, Satoshi Nakamoto.He concluded:“It is fairer to make a comparison between [cryptocurrencies] that have made more or less the same start and that have obtained and enlarged their circulation supplement through mining as Satoshi Nakamoto intended.”Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, Analysis, Mining, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

IOHK, the company behind Cardano, had a successful balance check before the official network snapshot, with its CEO Charles Hoskinson saying several major bugs and issues were resolved in the meantime.Several pilot projects are currently in the works and the company launched a partnership with New Balance, successfully implementing its blockchain solution to reduce counterfeiting.And while all of this only strengthened the community’s confidence in the project and its charismatic leader, Cardano’s price barely reacted to any of the major developments in the company. The price of its native cryptocurrency ADA, which is down more than 96 percent from its ATH, has been stagnant for months.According to data from IntoTheBlock, there has been a steady number of transactions larger than $100,000 in the past three months.

193,CryptoSlate,"NEO, Ontology, and VeChain appear to be recovering quickly",Ali Martinez,1574737200.0,"Some of the most prominent China-based blockchain projects appear to be recovering quickly after the recent downturn in the market. The following technical analysis evaluates whether NEO, Ontology, and VeChain have the potential for a further advance.NEOOver the last two weeks, NEO saw its value plummet nearly 38 percent. This cryptocurrency went from trading at a high of $13.45 on Nov. 13 to a low of $8.41 on Nov. 25.Despite the massive sell-off, NEO was able to bounce off the 75 percent Fibonacci retracement level quickly. Now, it is trading within the 65 and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement zone. This Fibonacci retracement area is considered by many traders as the ‘golden’ retracement zone due to the high probability of a rebound.A spike in volume around the current price levels could take this crypto to surge and test the next level of resistance at $10. This price hurdle represents by the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level. But, a further increase in demand could take NEO to the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, at $10.86.NEO/USD by TradingViewThe TD sequential indicator adds credibility to the bullish outlook. This technical index is presenting a buy signal in the form of a red nine on both the 1-day and the 12-hour chart. A green two candlestick trading above a preceding green one candle on any of the two timeframes could validate the bullish signal. If this happens, NEO may surge for a one to four candlesticks or begin of a new bullish countdown.The combination of the red nine candlesticks with a spinning top on the 1-day chart and a reversal doji on the 12-hour chart are strong indications that NEO is preparing for an upswing.NEO/USD by TradingViewNonetheless, if the selling pressure behind this crypto rises taking it to close below the recent low of $8.41, then a further correction would take place. NEO could plunge to the next support level at $7.80 or even lower to $6.70.Ontology (ONT)Ontology was one of the cryptocurrencies that benefitted the most from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s decision to embrace blockchain technology. Following the announcement, ONT skyrocketed nearly 120 percent to hit a high of $1.19 on Oct. 27.Despite the bullish sentiment that China brought into this cryptocurrency, less than a month later it plummeted to the same level where it began surging. This is a clear example of a classic pump and dump scheme.ONT/USD by TradingViewNow, Ontology is showing several bullish signals on its 12-hour chart.Under this timeframe, a bullish divergence is forming between the relative strength index (RSI) and the price of ONT. Divergences occur when an oscillator such as the RSI disagrees with the actual price movement. Thus, an RSI making a series of higher lows while prices are declining is indicative of an improving trend. And, the chances for a trend change from bearish to bullish increases.ONT/USD by TradingViewAdditionally, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is starting to turn bullish. This technical indicator follows the path of a trend and calculates its momentum. As the 12-twelve-hour exponential moving average gets closer to the 26-twelve-hour exponential moving average, the odds for a crossover rise. Such a bullish crossover usually leads to a price increase.ONT/USD by TradingViewA series of support and resistance levels could help determine whether Ontology is bound for a bullish impulse.A close above the $0.635 resistance level could be succeeded by an increase in demand that takes ONT to test the $0.73 barrier. From that point, this crypto would have to face the next resistance levels at $0.83 and $0.93.Conversely, if the bullish signals previously mentioned are invalidated Ontology could continue the bearish trend. Thus, closing below the $0.55 support level would likely trigger a spike in sell orders taking this cryptocurrency down to $0.50 or $0.45.ONT/USD by TradingViewVeChain (VET)VeChain has enjoyed a healthy uptrend after rumors that link it with China’s launch of a nationwide vaccine tracking system. Allegedly, the company has been working on drug traceability, monitoring, security, and auditing solution for the nations’ pharmaceutical industry since 2018. And, the platform will launch in March 2020.As the true utility of VET is presented, investors appear to be backing up this cryptocurrency. Since late October, VeChain is up 113 percent and is signaling a further advance.The bullish momentum appears to have been technically triggered by a golden cross that developed on VET’s 1-day chart between the 7, 30 and 50-day moving averages. This formation occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average signaling a potential bullish breakout. Many investors see this pattern as one of the most definitive buy signals that could start a long-term uptrend.Although VeChain recently retraced over 40 percent, the 50-day moving average was able to act as support allowing this crypto to rebound. Now, VET is back above the 7-day moving average, which estimates a continuation of the bullish trend.VET/USD by TradingViewAlong the same lines, the TD sequential indicator is presenting a buy signal under the same timeframe. Based on this technical index, the moment a green two candlestick trades above a preceding green one candle can be considered as a bullish signal.VET/USD by TradingViewIf VET is indeed about to continue its uptrend, it would first have to close above the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level. If this happens, then it would likely try to test the next level of resistance around the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level.Nonetheless, a close below the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level could jeopardize the bullish outlook. Such a downturn could be followed by a further decline to the 61.8 or 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level.VET/USD by TradingViewOverall sentimentEven though the entire cryptocurrency market went through a massive sell-off recently, it seems like these China-based tokens could be recovering soon. At the moment, NEO, Ontology, and VeChain present bullish signals estimating that a bullish impulse is underway.Despite the bullishness seen across these cryptos, it is wiser to always wait for confirmation before entering a trade. And, one must be cautious about the different support levels that could break and trigger a sharp decline.Posted In: Neo, VeChain, China, Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

194,CryptoSlate,"Cardano network snapshot most likely to happen on Nov. 29, Shelley testnet begins Dec. 9",Priyeshu Garg,1574766000.0,"After a successful balance check, IOHK released a tentative date for the final network snapshot for the incentivized testnet. According to Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of Cardano’s parent company IOHK, the snapshot will most likely happen on Nov. 29, while the incentivized testnet for Shelley will be released on Dec. 9.Tentative dates for the incentivized testnet network snapshot releasedAfter months of teasing, the incentivized testnet for the Cardano network is slowly becoming a reality. Cardano’s parent company, IOHK, has been putting off the release of Cardano’s Shelley era in order to work out all of the bugs and issues of a complex network.The balance check for Shelley’s incentivized testnet has been one of the biggest developments the company has seen in the past couple of months. As the trial run before the network snapshot that will transfer users’ ADA onto the testnet was an overwhelming success, the community became impatient about the date of the final snapshot.In a surprise AMA following the balance check, Hoskinson avoided giving out any set dates for the final snapshot, saying a clear schedule will be released at least a few days prior to the snapshot to allow users to prepare.On Nov. 25, he announced on Twitter that the “tentative” date for the snapshot will be Nov. 29. While Hoskinson’s tweet implied that there was still room for change in the dates he set, they are in line with the company’s earlier predictions.Shelley’s incentivized testnet coming on Dec. 9Apart from announcing the most likely date for the snapshot, Hoskinson said that the company will also publish new information regarding staking, which include percentages and other details about the testnet rewards, on Dec. 5.However, the biggest reveal was the estimated date for the release of Shelley’s testnet. With all the hype surrounding the balance check and the upcoming snapshot, the release of the actual incentivized testnet had fallen out of focus.According to Hoskinson’s tweet, the testnet will most likely be released on Dec. 9.More details about the testnet should be revealed during the upcoming Cardano workshop. While the main topic of discussion will be the company’s 2020 roadmap, there’s very little chance that a recap of the final snapshot won’t be discussed.As time goes by, it’s clear that the Cardano development team is becoming more and more confident in their product—just a few weeks ago there were almost no mentions of any clear dates as Hoskinson kept reminding the community that they should expect significant delays.The community’s response to the tentative snapshot and testnet dates has been overwhelmingly positive, with most praising Cardano for working around the clock to put Shelley out.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

195,CryptoSlate,IOTA can now be used as a payment system for any game or app,Priyeshu Garg,1574658000.0,"An IOTA (MIOTA) developer successfully implemented the IOTA as a payment system that can be used in any game or app. The system works seamlessly across all platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, WebAbb, Xbox, and Playstation 4.A new way to utilize IOTA as a payment systemA promising and ambitious blockchain project, IOTA has been struggling with a slow development process and a lack of adoption. It’s hard to say why the project, a brainchild of a German blockchain foundation, has had such slow growth, but competition from more recognizable names such as Ethereum or Cardano certainly doesn’t help.But, it doesn’t mean that the company has an inferior product. Its protocol is built to facilitate the emerging machine-to-machine (m2m) economy of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) by creating a fee-less, highly scalable, asset transfer network.Earlier this year, the company was involved in one of the biggest smart city initiatives in Texas, pushing its product as a solution to interoperability problems in the transportation industry.However, it seems that the company’s large-scale projects won’t be what brings the masses to IOTA, as a community developer managed to find a way to utilize the ambitious project as a payment system for any game or application.With gaming being one of the fastest-growing and highest-grossing industries in tech, IOTA’s foray into the industry could bring it closer to a whole new group of people.IOTA co-founder supports the effortThe implementation was created by IOTA developer Marlon Morales (@ESavsa) and first shared on his Twitter profile. In the tweet, Morales included a short video showing an IOTA wallet and a transaction made from the wallet.#IOTA #Unity #CsharpI did it. IOTA implemented as paymentsystem for ANY game or app. It could work on all Unity supported platforms: Android, IOS, MacBook, Windows, WebApp, Playstation 4, Xbox and more.Functions supported at the moment: Send, Balance, get save unused address pic.twitter.com/sKoHiNsUoD— Marlon Morales (@ESavsa) November 24, 2019Morales said that the IOTA payment system he developed works an all platforms that support Unity, a cross-platform game engine used to develop video games. This means that, in theory, IOTA can be used as a payment system on 15 different platforms, including PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, PS3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Wii U, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and Tizen, among others.The payment system lacks any complex features, and only enables users to send and receive IOTA, check their wallet balances, and save unused IOTA addresses.Dominik Scheiner, the co-founder of IOTA, praised Morales, saying the wallet and the payment system was commendable work.However, Morales himself sees the system as more of a community project. In a follow-up tweet, he explained that the goal of the program he designed was to give free access to anyone looking to implement the payment system on their games.Posted In: IOTA, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

196,CryptoSlate,"XRP, EOS, and ADA dive 8%: Will the total crypto market cap drop further after 27% fall?",Joseph Young,1574671800.0,"The price of XRP, EOS, Cardano (ADA), and other major cryptocurrencies have dropped by more than eight percent on the day, causing the total crypto market cap to fall by 27 percent in merely two months.In late October, the total market cap of cryptocurrencies was hovering at $255 billion, as XRP, EOS, ADA, and others demonstrated signs of solid recovery.EOS, in particular, increased from $2.6 to $3.69 in a span of a week in early November, by almost 42 percent.However, the upside momentum of most alternative cryptocurrencies was short-lived, especially XRP and Ethereum, which have historically led the altcoin market, plunged following Bitcoin’s big drop.Is a bigger drop likely?It is difficult to determine a single driving factor for the decline of the cryptocurrency market if the downside movement occurs in an extended period.Short term movements are often fueled by large margin trading platforms like BitMEX, but Bitcoin and major altcoins including XRP, EOS, and ADA have performed poorly throughout November for almost three weeks.Most major altcoins like XRP, EOS, and ADA are down by 85 to 97% against the USD (source: athcoinindex)ADA, for instance, despite highly anticipated network updates around Shelley, dropped from $0.046 to $0.0358, by 22 percent from November 18 to 25, also within a week.XRP has secured key partnerships in the third and fourth quarters of 2019, as Ripple’s deal with MoneyGram to bolster the usage of XRP on remittance networks.Yet, the price of XRP has actually dropped year-to-date, as one of the few major cryptocurrencies to see a net negative 11 months into 2019.The decline in the price of Bitcoin is likely caused by a combination of factors:sell-off of BTC by small miners;lowering volume in the latter half of the year;and futures markets showing more short contracts than long.The price of Bitcoin has dropped below the breakeven point for miners and as such, some technical analysts anticipate BTC to test lower supports like $5,800.If BTC continues to fall in the short term without strong relief rallies, in spite of technical indicators showing that major alternative cryptocurrencies are oversold, the sell-off of crypto assets could continue.Can XRP, EOS, and ADA recover by the year’s end?When the Bitcoin price tested $6,600 earlier today, the XRP price moved closer to its $0.19 support level, which technical analysts like DonAlt have been closely observing$XRP update:$0.30 was quite important, let's hope $0.19 will be as well.The price action on XRPUSD is uncannily technical. pic.twitter.com/gJyzZeRYbm— DonAlt (@CryptoDonAlt) November 22, 2019A minor drop of the Bitcoin price to the low-$6,000 region in the upcoming days could easily push altcoins below key support levels, making it significantly more difficult for XRP, EOS, ADA, and others to recover by the end of 2019.The steep fall of altcoins after being down by well over 90 percent from their record highs could also demonstrate that investors are dismissing oversold conditions of most crypto assets as the cryptocurrency market continues to see a steep sell-off.Posted In: Cardano, EOS, XRP, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

197,CryptoSlate,Charles Hoskinson says Cardano Shelley testnet balance check was an overwhelming success,Priyeshu Garg,1574401560.0,"The long-awaited balance snapshot for Cardano’s Shelley incentivized testnet was an overwhelming success. Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, said that the company managed to achieve a lot in a short period of time even though it was facing issues during the check.Successful balance check will enable a smooth network snapshotIt seems that slow and steady does indeed win the race, as Cardano has shown that a careful and calculated approach that learns through trial and error eventually achieves success. After an action-packed few weeks in which we saw the launch of exciting new projects and updates, the balance check for Shelley’s incentivized testnet has finally happened. In another surprise YouTube AMA, Charles Hoskinson shared the latest news and updates around Cardano. Hoskinson, who is one of the founders of Ethereum and the CEO of Cardano’s parent company IOHK, doubled down on his belief that blockchain development is a tedious process that cannot yield results without years of work being put into it.One of the biggest developments in Cardano in the past few months has been the balance check for Shelley’s incentivized testnet. The trial run before the network snapshot that will transfer users’ ADA onto the testnet was an overwhelming success, Hoskinson said. Related: Charles Hoskinson says Cardano ‘making haste slowly,’ snapshot for Shelley most likely on Nov. 12The check, which was scheduled for Nov. 12, managed to achieve a lot in a short period of time. Hoskinson said that all of the expected errors and bugs occurred and were promptly resolved by Cardano’s team. Issues stemmed both from Cardano as a 2018 legacy bug was discovered and users who failed to follow the adequate procedure. The biggest problem users were faced with as having their wallets show an incorrect balance after the snapshot. Even with the bugs that occurred, Hoskinson said that the biggest challenge was getting everything and everyone to work together. Luckily, the balance check managed to accomplish that, he said, adding that the team was happy with the velocity and the state of the software. Following eras of Cardano could happen at the same timeWhile the balance check is just a drop in the bucket that is the development of Shelley, it’s a step in the right direction. Any successful test seems to restore the community’s faith in Cardano, which always seems to be on thin legs due to its slow development process. Hoskinson, on the other hand, seems to have extremely ambitious plans for Cardano. One of the main topics he will discuss the upcoming Cardano workshop on Dec. 2 will be the 2020 roadmap. It will be the first time he openly discusses the possibility of launching Shelley and Goguen, two separate eras of Cardano, together. He said, adding that there was a good possibility they would be launched at the same time:“We’re fairly optimistic that those things aren’t far apart from each other.”This is a major step for the company. The arrival of Goguen will mean that Basho, the era of Cardano that focuses on scalability and interoperability, will be close behind. All of these updates serve as building blocks that will be used to create a stable foundation for Voltaire, the blockchain’s final era. Voltaire, Hoskinson explained, is about governance and will bring about a built-in voting system that serves both the treasure and updates. However, the Cardano community will have to wait at least until Q2 2020 before any major updates about Voltaire are released. The release of Voltaire will happen around the same time when IOHK’s contract to work on Cardano will expire. Hoskinson said that the future of IOHK’s involvement with the project will most likely be decided through votes cast through a Cardano Improvement Proposal Committee (CIP). People will be able to interact with CIPs through the newsfeed in the newly released Cardano wallets, he explained, adding that they will be transmitted as transactions on the Cardano blockchain.Next year is set to be one of the most action-packed ones for Cardano. Hoskinson revealed that the company’s priority for 2020 will be to add features to Cardano without using a lot of coding. Another important pursuit for 2020 will be the development of decentralized applications (dapps) on Cardano. Hoskinson only touched on the topic of Ethereum interoperability, saying that it would be discussed in detail during the December summit.A holistic approach to blockchainWhile it was a welcome change of pace to hear some of the concrete developments made by the company, the Cardano community wanted to dive deep into Cardano’s long-term strategy. Many viewers were interested in Cardano’s plans with ADA, its native cryptocurrency. With a stagnating price that lost most of its value following the 2017 ICO boom, many seemed worried about the future of their ADA investments. Hoskinson didn’t take kindly to those seeking only the short-term, trading value in cryptocurrencies. He said that Cardano was one of the few, if not the only company that has taken a holistic approach towards transactions on the blockchain and that it has set its sights on changing the world, not getting rick quickly.When it comes to ADA, Hoskinson seems to believe that there’s a strong connection between ADA as a store of value and ADA as a backbone to the Cardano protocol. ADA’s value will naturally rise as the number of users on the blockchain increases. “If the goal is appreciation, it’s achieved through the use of the system.”For people to use a system it needs to host dapps and enable efficient transactions, he added. Ensuring that Cardano’s development goes in that direction will be the job of the Cardano Foundation and EMURGO. Both entities are already knee-deep in blockchain development. The Cardano Foundation already supports various initiatives that focus on blockchain governance and implementation, especially in Africa.IOHK’s “holistic” approach to blockchain is evident in its relationship with patents. Hoskinson believes that blockchain and crypto companies that hold patents have a warped view of what the industry represents. The point of the crypto industry is to decentralize everything and make sure there is no one person or entity in charge, he said. The crypto industry hosts some of the most complex software created anywhere and patenting it would just render it obsolete. Hoskinson’s disdain towards patented software was quickly overshadowed by his disdain towards Stellar. The company’s recent token burn was a wrong decision, he told viewers.He said, adding that burning tokens is something that could never happen at Cardano. “They’re market manipulation on the short term for speculators at the expense of the future of the protocol.”It would require Cardano to steal from people, as there is no large supply of ADA sitting around waiting to be burned, he said. While it provided Stellar with a short-term price appreciation, the burned tokens are essentially permanently lost value that could have been used for protocol development.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, People, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

198,CryptoSlate,DappRadar uncovers over $73 million in unaccounted Ethereum DApp volume,Priyeshu Garg,1574218800.0,"After adding ERC20 token tracking for all Ethereum dapps, data aggregator DappRadar uncovered $73 million in unaccounted for 7-day volume on the network. In a press release shared with CryptoSlate, the company said the increase in volume equates to $3.8 billion.Ethereum dapp ranking will now reflect real usageWhile decentralized applications are still a relatively new industry, they have been making serious strides in the past year. But, with several major networks competing for the same share of the market, it’s becoming increasingly important to track these apps to determine which market segments are on the rise.As the biggest and most dominant dapp platform, Etherum has been at the forefront of dapp development in the past couple of years, attributing over 60 percent of dapp trading volume on the market.However, it turns out that Ethereum might be an even bigger player than previous data has suggested, as a new way of tracking showed that there are billions in unaccounted volume on the network.According to dapp data aggregator DappRadar, from now on ETH dapps will be ranked on the total volume of all ETH-based ERC20 tokens passing through their smart contracts. While this is a small change in the company’s tracking metrics, it managed to paint a more realistic picture of the market.In a press release shared with CryptoSlate, the company said DappRadar was the only company doing this and that a similar feature is currently live on EOS.ETH dapp volume could reach $4 billion annuallySkirmantas Januskas, the co-founder and CEO of DappRadar, said that the new way of measuring dapp volume would increase the transparency of value creation on the Ethereum blockchain. This, he added, will be especially beneficial to decentralized exchanges that support ERC20 token trading.DappRadar found that decentralized exchange (DEX) ForkDelta, which previously showed a 7-day ETH volume of $778,000, had an additional $16.8 million worth of weekly transaction volume on Nov. 19.This is just one example of previously unaccounted for trading volume. The company said adding a new tracking metric increased the 7-day trading volume on Ethereum from $27 million to just over $100 million. That means that 73 million more US dollars have been circulating the Ethereum network in the past week.Just under $40 million in volume came from decentralized crypto exchanges on the network, while gambling brought in just $311,000 in volume. The rest of the newly uncovered volume, around $33.5 million, came from DeFi apps.DappRadar’s newest data shows that the growth DeFi and DEX platforms have seen in the past year isn’t a passing fad, but a creation of a valid new industry that seems bound to stay here.Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

199,CryptoSlate,Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer says real adoption happening at the enterprise level,Priyeshu Garg,1574133900.0,"Brendan Blumer, the founder and CEO of Block.one, believes that blockchain technology has created a huge social movement that enabled real adoption to happen on an enterprise level.During a panel at the Blocksberg Summit, Blumer shared his thoughts on EOSIO, Block.one’s ambitious blockchain project, saying the company’s goal is always to align with its user base.EOSIO set out to rectify Bitcoin’s biggest issuesEver since its whitepaper was released, Bitcoin has been the building block of the crypto industry. The groundbreaking idea gave birth to thousands of other cryptocurrencies, most of which were created to be the next Bitcoin.EOSIO, the ambitious blockchain project created by Block.one, isn’t one of them.According to Brendan Blumer, the founder and CEO of Block.one, EOSIO wants to focus on expanding the use-cases for blockchain technology. During the Blocksberg Summit at Virginia Tech, where the idea of EOSIO was first conceived, Blumer discussed Block.one’s beginnings and shared his views on the current state of the blockchain industry.In an engaging talk with CNBC’s Brian Sullivan, Blumer explained that the goal with EOSIO was to create a blockchain that was faster, cheaper, and more scalable than Bitcoin. He is, however, a big believer in Bitcoin and the value proposition it brought to the world. He said:“I believe wholeheartedly that Bitcoin has really won that holy grail of store of value because the critical mass around it is just a massive value proposition as a whole.”Nonetheless, comparing Bitcoin with other crypto and blockchain projects is comparing apples to oranges. When asked whether Bitcoin has won the “crypto war,” Blumer said that other platforms working on smart contracts and various types of product-driven tokens will be what brings the biggest benefit to the industry.The crypto bubble has burst and left behind real interestThe great big crypto crash of 2017 led many to believe that any trust institutions might have had in the industry has been decimated. Blumer is much more optimistic in his predictions for the post-2017 crypto space, saying that the crash was an “unfortunate adjustment that was pretty much inevitable.”However, remnants of the interest and awareness that created the bubble in the first place are still here, he said, and are helping create real adoption on the enterprise level. He cited the New York Stock Exchange’s Bakkt and Fidelity’s crypto offerings as clear examples of institutions realizing the potential the industry offers.That potential is measured at an unprecedented growth rate, which IDC estimates at around 75 percent a year for the next five years. Blumer, on the other hand, thinks growth is going to be much more explosive than that.“I think 75% is conservative in terms of looking at the real dollars at the bottom line of organizations outlying capital expenditure.”One of the reasons why the industry could see an exponentially increasing growth year after year is that governments and financial institutions are yet to see blockchain’s true benefits. Embracing blockchain would allow any organization, be it a bank, a large corporation, or a national government, to have more transparency, less fraud, and more control over their money supply.It’s only a matter of time before we see a government put their national currency on the blockchain, Blumer said, adding that it would effectively turn that currency into a development platform.“The first groups to do so are going to get the benefit of all the developers building with blockchain technology integrating with their currencies because now the functionality they want—their currency supports.”Putting everything, including government-issued fiat currency, on a blockchain creates an unprecedented degree of transparency.

200,CryptoSlate,MakerDAO launches Multi-Collateral Dai as MKR holds steady,Ali Martinez,1574050320.0,"MakerDAO announced the release of Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD). The move is going to bring a wide range of new features to the Maker protocol, including Dai Savings Rate (DSR) and additional collateral asset types. Despite the major announcement, MKR’s price remains stagnant.The new Multi-Collateral DaiOver a month ago, MakerDAO disclosed a change in the terminology of its products and services. Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) was renamed Vault while Dai (Single-Collateral Dai) was replaced with Sai, and MCD-generated Dai was named Dai. The idea was to get users familiar with the new developments that were going to be released.Now, anyone can upgrade their Sai to Dai using the Migration app developed by the firm. A number of cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, announced their support for the new Dai. And, have offered to make the upgrade from Sai to Dai automatically.MakerDao’s new terminology. Source: MakerDaoWith the release of the new Multi-Collateral Dai, the decentralized autonomous organization will offer a range of new services to its users.MCD brings with it the much-anticipated Dai Savings Rate (DSR) mechanism. This allows Dai holders to lock up their tokens in a smart contract and earn additional Dai in the meantime. Although MKR holders will decide the initial rate, the risk management lead at the Maker Foundation, Cyrus Younessi, believes that it would likely be around 2 percent.According to Younessi:“Given the absence of any empirical data, it is difficult to select a precise starting DSR value. However, a DSR of 2% is likely to be competitive with the broader DeFi ecosystem, which currently offers a ~6% (and dropping) savings rate on Sai.”Mockup of the Dai Savings Rate dApp. Source: MakerDaoAdditionally, the upgrade introduces a wider range of collateral assets, which were previously limited to Ethereum only. At the moment, the Maker community is evaluating seven cryptocurrencies, including  Augur (REP), Basic Attention Token (BAT), DigixDAO (DGD), Ethereum (ETH), Golem (GNT), OmiseGo (OMG), and 0x (ZRX). Out of all of these tokens, the first two being considered for their low risk of integration are BAT and ETH.Despite the positivism seen across the market regarding the Multi-Collateral Dai, Udi Wertheimer, a bitcoin developer, criticized the move to back Dai with “illiquid shitcoins.”Wertheimer said:“Imagine you’re not going through life constantly reading crypto twitter and smart contracts. You believe DAI is a stablecoin backed by ETH (fairly liquid and a bit less volatile than other shitcoins). You go to an exchange to buy some. Oops! Here’s a [Basic Attention Token]-backed shitcoin instead.”As more people in the crypto community start to understand the impact of the recent announcement, MKR is holding steady without much volatility.MKR technical analysisOver the last few weeks, MKR saw its price rise over 67 percent from a low of $412 on Sept. 24 to a high of $690 on Nov. 11. The move was succeeded by a 19 percent correction that took this cryptocurrency down to $561, four days later.Now, the 50 and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels appear to be containing the price of Maker as it awaits for a spike in volume that will determine where it would head next.Based on its 12-hour chart, MKR is trading in a no-trade zone. The lower and upper Bollinger bands, sitting at $601 and $690, respectively, define this range. Trading within these support and resistance levels poses high-risk exposure. This is a result of the inability to determine in which direction the trend will result.As the Bollinger Bands squeeze on MKR’s 12-hour chart, the odds for a breakout increase. Thus, it will be wiser to wait for a clear move outside of this range before entering a trade.On the upside, if Maker closes above resistance it would signal a move up to the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level, at $794. However, a spike in the selling pressure behind this crypto could take it to close below the support level. If this happens, MKR would likely plummet to the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, at $541.MKR/USD by TradingViewMoving forwardThe recent announcement by MakerDAO is generating significant buzz around the community. Even Reuters ran a story dedicated to how Dai is planning to “change the stablecoin game.” However, there are those who believe that the move to back Dai with a number of cryptocurrencies that present high levels of illiquidity could be extremely dangerous. As there are different sentiments about the Multi-Collateral Dai, MKR could be preparing to make a significant price move soon. On the upside, it could surge to nearly $800 while on the downside, it could plunge to $541.Posted In: Altcoins, DeFi, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

201,CryptoSlate,"Altcoins retrace to 2017 levels: why it’s a critical moment for Ethereum, XRP, et al.",Joseph Young,1574053800.0,"Most major altcoins in the likes of Ethereum and XRP have already retraced to 2017 levels. As Bitcoin gears towards a bearish short term trend, investors remain divided on whether altcoins will continue their recovery or begin to see weakened momentum.In recent weeks, Ethereum, XRP, and other altcoins have demonstrated signs of an extended upside rally, with Ethereum, in particular, maintaining a strong support level at $180.While technical analysts foresee a pullback for altcoins in the short term, one trader says that the risk to reward ratio for a move up for altcoins is improving, creating a more favorable environment for a rally for Ethereum and XRP. Professional trader “Crypto Michael” said in a tweet:“Altcoins have fully retraced back to their 2017 and/or 2016 levels. Does that mean that they can go down some more? Yes, however, the R/R with upside potential is getting extremely better from here. Reminder; sentiment switches after price movements, not before.”Why altcoins like Ethereum and XRP are being resilientIn the past seven days, across major exchanges, the price of Bitcoin fell from over $9,000 to $8,450, by more than six percent against the U.S. dollar.In the same period, the price of Ethereum and XRP dropped by around three and five percent respectively.Altcoins have been performing better than bitcoin as of late because major alternative cryptocurrencies have already fallen by nearly 90 percent since the 2018 peak.Ethereum is fair-valued based on the token price bubble risk of LongHash (source: longhash.com)The next several weeks are considered to be a critical period for altcoins as it would decide whether a larger pullback to lower support levels will be tested or the current levels will be solidified as the medium to long term bottom for an extended rally.According to the Glassnode research team, sentiment around Bitcoin is mixed amongst traders and that BTC is also expected to see a decisive moment.While traders generally remain optimistic around the performance of altcoins, the amount of deposits to exchanges has declined recently, indicating a lack of appetite for cryptocurrencies at the current price range. The research team said:“Sentiment is mixed as investors wait for the next big BTC price move. This is a deciding moment as the market moves sideways. NUPL helps investors identify when to take profit (blue) & when to reenter (red). BTC exchange deposits and inflows have continued to decline over the last week, indicating low trading appetite from investors.”Are cryptocurrencies overvalued at the moment?Based on the token price bubble risk indicator of LongHash, a Singapore-based incubator, Bitcoin is hovering in the overvalued range at 1.2, with 1.5 and higher being a “bubble risk.”Ethereum along with other altcoins are in the “fair-valued” range between -0.5 to 0.5, which may indicate that while altcoins are likely to see a deeper pullback as Bitcoin slips, it will see resistance as it moves below key support levels.Posted In: Ethereum, XRP, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

202,CryptoSlate,Founders of privacy-focused Brave browser say they’re in an arms race they can win ,Priyeshu Garg,1573872300.0,"In a Reddit AMA, the co-founders of Brave said that the battle for privacy was an arms race they can win thanks to the company’s ability to innovate quickly. The launch of Brave 1.0 invited many questions from the Reddit community, most of which focused on Brave’s mechanisms for securing data and preventing tracking.Building on the legacy of MozillaPrivacy-focused Brave browser has had quite a successful year—from introducing multiple new features and signing up various new publishers such as Wikipedia, to hitting 9 million active monthly users earlier this week.While some might attribute its success solely to the ever-growing need for privacy online, there are numerous other factors that make it one of the fastest-growing browsers in the world. Created by two industry veterans Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy, Brave took the legacy of traditional browsers and drastically stepped up the game.Related: Basic Attention Token (BAT) adoption is surging as Brave 1.0 launchesEich, who created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded Mozilla, took to Reddit to answer community questions regarding the release of Brave 1.0. While the goal of the AMA was to promote the latest version of the browser, which both Bondy and Eich say is better, faster, and more secure than the previous one, the questioned seemed to focus on comparing Brave to its competitors.According to Eich, one of the biggest differences between working on Brave and working on Mozilla is the ability to innovate quickly. In an organization as big as Mozilla, he explained, introducing risky projects was almost impossible.However, if Brave is to continue to grow at its current pace, it’s only a matter of time before it transforms from a small, niche browser to a serious corporation, not unlike Mozilla. Eich’s solution to this seems to be to work faster and harder, as he hopes he would be “done” with all the risky and innovative project before Brave got “too big.”He said when asked why he would make a browser that competes with Mozilla:“Mozilla is not innovating as we are, perhaps because their dependence on Google search revenue ties their hands.”Brave building an empire on making privacy a valuable commodityAll of the innovations Bondy and Eich mentioned in the AMA referred to the company’s work on preventing tracking and user data collection. According to Eich, Brave doesn’t collect user browsing data at all, as all data is encrypted with a key only the user has. The browser’s opt-in Brave Rewards system uses blind-signature cryptography that disables the company from linking the users’ ad contributions. Bondy explained:“Brave as a company never gets your data, so we can never share your data. We’re also open source and can be audited at any time.”On the topic of auditing, several users raised concerns about government interference in Brave. The company’s privacy-centric business model could easily make it a target for organizations such as the NSA or the FBI. Eich said that Brave hasn’t been interfered with. If it did, Eich said he’d rather “shut Brave down” than allow for a backdoor in the browser’s code.The company’s effort to revolutionize online advertising is set to hit some roadblocks, but Eich believes its constant innovation will keep it in the game. When asked what if major websites such as Facebook and Google decided not to be compatible with Brave, Eich said that was an arms race they could win. He explained, adding that for now, Brave looks just like Chrome to most websites:“Browsers already spoof one another’s User-Agent: header values and there is no end to the ability to camouflage.”However, that doesn’t mean Brave is set to stay in the same place for much longer. According to Bondy, who is the company’s chief technical officer, there are detailed development plans in place for the next 12 months that will include doing more work on integration, Brave’s native crypto wallet, and platforms supporting Brave Rewards.He hinted that there might be a possibility of introducing a Brave VPN in the near future, a suggestion that was incredibly well received by the Brave community on Reddit.Earn Basic Attention Token (BAT) with Brave Web Browser  Try Brave Browser  Get $5 in free BAT to donate to the websites of your choice.Posted In: Basic Attention Token, Adoption, Altcoins, People, Privacy, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

However, unlike last year’s fork which gave birth to BSV, the event has come and gone largely unnoticed by the crypto community.BCH introduces minor upgrades to its codeBitcoin’s often contested offshoots never seemed to have shied away from controversy. One of the more divisive coins on the market, Bitcoin Cash, has had quite a scandalous fork last year, giving birth to two new assets that competed for the market share.This year’s fork, however, has come and gone without much notice from the crypto community. While it’s hard to say whether it’s due to the minor upgrades that were introduced or a general decrease in interest in Bitcoin Cash, the market had quite a bland reaction to the code changes.These changes have been the main topic of discussion among BCH developers for the last few months and will focus on enforcing existing rules and securing transactions. According to the BCH repository on GitHub, all of the updates in the fork will be compatible with all miners.Apart from a brief withdrawal and deposit suspension on several exchanges, the fork had no major effect on the market.While BCH’s price remained relatively stable in the days preceding the fork, it dropped just over 4 percent after the fork was finalized.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price chart after forkBitcoin Cash has clean symmetric splitBitMEX Research, the research and analytics arm of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, following the fork.

204,CryptoSlate,Weiss Crypto Ratings says ‘Cardano is clearly superior to EOS’,Priyeshu Garg,1573725600.0,"Weiss Crypto Ratings, a crypto and financial ratings company, managed to divide the crypto community on Twitter yet again by saying that Cardano is “clearly” superior to EOS. While many were arguing over the merits of each project, most agreed that the company has lost all of its credibility.Crypto rating company stirs the pot with yet another bold claimAfter the ICO boom of 2017 died out, the crypto space seemed ready to adopt more serious, research-driven projects. Companies working on ambitious projects such as Cardano, EOS, and TRON began gaining a lot of traction, each one gaining an incredibly dedicated following.With that, the competition between similar projects, or projects looking to solve similar problems, began to rise. A deep schism was created in the crypto community, every group more determined than the other to fight for the success of the project it supports.In such a climate, any statements directly comparing two projects are almost always going to wreak havoc within the crypto community, which is why most steer clear of any controversial statements. Weiss Crypto Ratings, on the other hand, doesn’t.The rating company gas garnered quite a reputation for its inflammatory comments online. Just last week, the company went ahead with a very bold proposition, suggesting the XRP community should transfer to XLM, as Stellar had more of a “technological advantage” over Ripple’s platform.Continuing to stir the pot, Weiss then tweeted another unsubstantiated claim, saying that Cardano was “vastly superior” to EOS.Weiss Crypto Ratings believe Cardano is superior to EOS.Weiss followed up its assertion in a series of tweets starting with its observation that EOS has centralization problems.1/4 Not only does #EOS have problems with centralization, but lately, the network has also been unable to process any transactions for anyone who doesn't have a substantial amount of EOS locked up and staked. This is a result of EOS trying to go with a feeless structure.— Weiss Crypto Ratings (@WeissCrypto) November 14, 2019Crypto community united over disdain towards WeissIn a follow-up tweet, the company shared more details backing up its claim. Namely, Weiss Crypto said that the reason Cardano was superior to EOS was that it had just completed the first snapshot and balance check of the network for the Shelley incentivized testnet.Cardano completed first snapshot for Shelly testnetThe explanation, as many users pointed out, sounded more like an advertisement for Cardano than a well-thought-out argument.As expected, the statement caused quite a reaction on Twitter. Hundreds of users responded to the tweet and the reactions were mixed, to say the least. While some contested the assertion of Cardano’s superiority, saying EOS had a far bigger user base and potential, others were adamant in their defense of the yet-to-be-functional Cardano.Good to see there's an opportunity for fact-based, unbiased ratings and reviews in crypto, given the very clear absence of rigorous, unbiased ratings and reviews.Seriously, this one tweet discredits your entire brand in an instant. pic.twitter.com/IsfpbAaWLg— Rich Downing (@Rich_Downing) November 14, 2019However, despite the vast differences in opinion, almost everyone seemed to agree on one thing—Weiss Ratings has lost the little credibility it had.Leaving EOS and Cardano aside, there is an argument to be made here that a company that provides “unbiased” ratings of stocks, ETFs, financial institutions, and cryptocurrencies should restrain itself from making statements like these.Posted In: Cardano, EOS, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

205,CryptoSlate,Basic Attention Token (BAT) adoption is surging as Brave 1.0 launches,Ali Martinez,1573719960.0,"Brave Software announced the official launch of its popular privacy-centric web browser Brave. Meanwhile, several technical indicators estimate that its native crypto, Basic Attention Token (BAT), could be bound for a further bullish impulse.Brave 1.0 is hereBrave is an open-source web browser with a built-in ad-blocker, tracking, and security protection. It anonymously monitors user attention, then rewards publishers accordingly with Basic Attention Tokens via the integrated Brave Rewards program. Approximately 70 percent of ad revenue is distributed among its users.In a blog post, Brave Software revealed that the official version of its web browser is live. Brave browser is now available for download for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, which widening its accessibility to millions of users.Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave Software, believes that Brave 1.0 is the solution to the “surveillance capitalism [that] has plagued the Web.”“Brave is the answer. Brave 1.0 is the browser reimagined, transforming the Web to put users first with a private, browser-based ads and payment platform. With Brave, the Web can be a rewarding experience for all, without users paying with their privacy,” added Eich.Brave leads in terms of privacy against other browsers. Source: Brave 1.0 Reviewer’s GuideThe move to finally launch the stable version of Brave comes after the success that its beta version had over the last three years. In mid-October, the firm announced that its daily active users surpassed 2.8 million. And, its monthly active users hit an all-time high of 8 million. The ads on the open-source browser also saw an exponential increase hitting a click-through-rate of 14 percent. This represents 7x more than the industry average.Today, Brave has nearly 9 million monthly active users across the globe. This achievement is correlated with the substantial growth of Brave’s verified publishers. Since the beginning of the year, the number of verified websites, which include The Washington Post, The Guardian, and Wikipedia, surged 3.5x. Meanwhile, the number of verified publishers coming from YouTube alone skyrocketed 11x.Brave’s Verified Publishers. Source: BatGrowthBrave’s rise in popularity can also be perceived in its native cryptocurrency, Basic Attention Token. Since late September, BAT’s has gone up from a low of $0.15 to a high of $0.27, representing an 84.5 percent increase. Now, this crypto could be hinting a further advance.BAT technical analysisFrom a long-term perspective, Basic Attention Token broke out of a multi-month consolidating phase. During this time, its price was contained within a descending parallel channel, which appears to be part of a significant bull flag. This is considered a continuation pattern, which is developing on BAT’s 1-week chart since February.The 4x upswing that took this crypto to hit a high of $0.50 in mid-April formed the flagpole. And, the 70 percent correction to a low of $0.15 in late September created the flag. The bull flag estimates an 80 percent target to the upside given by the height of the flagpole.BAT/USD by TradingViewIf the buying pressure behind Basic Attention Token continues to increase, it could lead to a move up to the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, which sits at $0.35. This cryptocurrency would have to first close above the 61.8 Fib, then break above the 50 Fib with enough volume to hit the 38.2 Fib.Nevertheless, a close below the 65 Fib could invalidate the bullish outlook. If this happens, Basic Attention Token could then retrace to $0.22 or even $0.19.Moving forwardBased on the success that Brave browser had this year, it seems like the launch of its stable version could set the stage for a great 2020. The recent partnership with Everipedia opens a whole new range of opportunities. With the millions of monthly unique users that Everipedia has, Brave will likely continue to increase its popularity, which is already skyrocketing.

207,CryptoSlate,Celsius Network surpasses $4 billion in crypto loans,Priyeshu Garg,1573611780.0,"   The Lending and Borrowing News Category was brought to you by the CryptoSlate and Cred Partnership. Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency lending platform, announced that it has surpassed $4.25 billion in loan origination. In a press release shared with CryptoSlate, the company said that it was a 93 percent increase from the $2.2 billion it recorded at the beginning of 2019.Crypto lending is the fastest growing industry in the crypto marketUsing cryptocurrencies as collateral for fiat loans isn’t a new idea, but few companies so far have been able to create a successful business that provides cryptocurrency loans. Nonetheless, there are many crypto lending platforms available, all of them competing for an equally small part of the market.Back in April, a Bloomberg report showed that there has been a steady increase in the number of people using various cryptocurrencies as collateral to borrow money. The increased interest in crypto loans, however, has opened up Pandora’s box—a lack of oversight of the industry has enabled numerous bad actors and shady businesses to open up shop.Many crypto lenders are often opaque about where or how they store a borrower’s digital currency, as well as the fees the platform charges, Bloomberg reported.One of the bigger players in the space, Celsius Network, set out to challenge these industry standards with a transparent business model and an innovative approach to distributing loan interest. The company’s CEO, Alex Mashinsky, said:“Celsius gives back 80% of loan interest to our depositors with no minimums, caps, fees or penalties.”More than $4 billion in loan originationIn a press release shared with CryptoSlate, Celsius Networks announced that the increased interest in crypto lending allowed the company to surpass $4.25 billion in loan origination since beginning its lending operations in July 2018. This is a 93 percent increase from the $2.2 billion at the beginning of 2019.Its target audience, the company said, is everyone from ordinary customers sick and tired of low-savings bank accounts to institutions looking to profit from their crypto holdings.There are currently over 50,000 members on the Celsius Network, 150 of which are institutions. While the company didn’t disclose who any of its clients are, its press release said that the list includes “some of the largest trading firms in the U.S.” and other HFT firms around the world.The company’s generous loan interest distribution has reportedly earned its clients over $5 million in interest income since 2018. Mashinsky said in the press release:“Our incredible growth shows there is high demand for lending platforms that put the needs of depositors first.”Celsius token surged nearly 9 percent post announcement but the CEL token has an extremely low 24h-volume of $37,800 at the time of publishing.

208,CryptoSlate,Prominent analyst says only the top 40 cryptos are liquid ,Priyeshu Garg,1573606740.0,"Crypto analyst Willy Woo said that very few coins are good investments, as data from CoinMarketCap has shown that only the top 40 out of the 4987 listed coins are liquid.Part of the crypto community remained skeptical, saying that few coins have been around long enough to be able to compete with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the like.Less than 1% of all coins listed on Coinmarketcap have liquidityWhile envisioned as safe-haven assets, cryptocurrencies have been notoriously easy to manipulate. The overall lack of liquidity in the market gives power to the few whales that hold large quantities of a coin, which can swing the price of even the most stable cryptos at any given time.The inability to quickly buy and sell an asset on the market has been one of the biggest reasons why institutional interest in the industry has been stagnating. With most experienced investors looking for a “quick in, quick out” scheme, going all-in into cryptocurrencies is not a viable option.Willy Woo, a prominent crypto analyst and partner at Adaptive Capital, certainly believes so. Woo shared a tweet earlier today where he noted that out of the 4978 coins currently listed on CoinMarketCap, only the top 40 are liquid.He shared a graph listing the top 50 cryptocurrencies “by volume,” where only the first 39 have the liquidity that was registered by the exchange. That means that just 0.81 percent of all cryptocurrencies listed on Coinmarketcap offer liquidity.(Source: Twitter)“Investors want liquidity at entry and liquidity on exit. Very few coins have credible liquidity to be good investments,” he wrote.Not everyone looking for asset allocationIn a follow-up tweet, Woo explained that there were two types of investing—asset allocation and tech investing. Those looking to allocate some of their assets and gain exposure to crypto would steer clear from illiquid coins and put their money into large market cap cryptos such as Bitcoin.Those looking to invest in early tech companies are opting for a much higher risk, with Woo saying there was only a 5 percent chance of returning such an investment. According to him, Bitcoin is the go-to crypto for exposure to the sector, while the rest are “startup bets.”However, Woo’s statements weren’t well-received by the crypto community. Erik Voorhees, the CEO of ShapeShift, said that it wasn’t a fair comparison as most of the projects he listed were less than three years old.Others pointed out that the volume of the top three coins on Woo’s chart—USDT, BTC, and ETH—might be distorted, as all three are considered to be entry pairs to other cryptocurrencies.Some said that liquidity in itself shouldn’t be a determining factor as to whether or not one invests in a crypto project. A user pointed out that liquidity was irrelevant, as the notorious Ponzi scheme BitConnect had liquidity, but Chinese Ethereum competitor NANO didn’t.Posted In: Bitcoin, Tether, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

209,CryptoSlate,VeChain (VET) up 10% after Binance US listing; what’s next?,Ali Martinez,1573204980.0,"Binance.US announced that it would be listing VeChain to its retail platform for U.S. cryptocurrency investors.Binance.US Adds VeChainVeChain (VET) is an enterprise-focused blockchain ecosystem that aims to enhance supply chain management. It connects blockchain technology with real-world applications through a comprehensive governance structure, a robust economic model, and advanced IoT integration. With its technology, manufacturers can assign products with unique identifiers to track them through a supply chain.VeChain was open for trading on the Binance.US platform as of Nov. 7 at 9:00 PM EST. Therefore, users can already start depositing and trading this cryptocurrency in their accounts. VET has only been listed against the US dollar (USD), and its Bitcoin (BTC) pair could be listed later, depending on the demand that it generates.The listing on Binance.US will provide market access to VeChain for millions of retail investors. This triggered a substantial increase in the price of this cryptocurrency trading as high as $0.006 after the news dropped. Now, it seems like VET could be bound for a pullback before the continuation of its bullish trend.VET Technical AnalysisOver the last few weeks, VeChain has experienced an astronomical bullish impulse that has taken its price up over 110 percent. On Oct. 24, this cryptocurrency was trading around $0.00285 and now it recently reached a high of $0.006.The latest push appears to be related to Binance.US’s decision to integrate VET into its retail platform. But, there are a series of developments by the VeChain Foundation that is triggering an increase in demand for this crypto. The Foundation not so long ago announced the first cross-continental logistics and trades solution based on a public blockchain for the food and beverage industry, which is creating a lot of buzz around the community.As more developments are announced, VET is looking very bullish in the long-term from a technical perspective.Based on the 1-week chart, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), which is commonly used to follow the path of a trend and calculate its momentum, recently turned bullish. As the 12-week exponential moving average crossed over the 26-week exponential moving average, the probability for a further upswing increased.If VeChain can close above the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, it could trigger an increase in the buying pressure behind this cryptocurrency. A rising volume could lead to an upward move that takes VET to test the 50 or 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level, sitting at $0.0067 and $0.0076, respectively.VET/USD by TradingViewHowever, after the 110 percent surge seen in the last three weeks, VeChain could soon find an exhaustion point. This would allow VET to retrace to maintain the uptrend healthy and let sideliners jump back in.In fact, the TD sequential on the 1-day chart will be giving a sell signal in the next few hours. This bearish signal, in combination with the resistance given by the setup trendline, is strong evidence that a pullback is underway. Therefore, if VET closes below the 200-day moving average it could likely plummet to the 150 or the 100-day moving average that sit around $0.0050 and $0.0041, respectively.Overall SentimentThe crypto community seems to be positive about the future of VeChain. The announcement by Binance.US to make this cryptocurrency available to millions of retail investors triggered a spike in demand. Additionally, the work put up by the VeChain Foundation to create Foodgates, a cross-continental logistics and trade platform, helped pushed VET even further.Now, it seems like its time for investors to profit from the recent bullish impulse, which could cause a pullback. This could help maintain the uptrend healthy and preserve the optimistic outlook seen on VeChain’s 1-week chart.   VeChain 2 Dec at 2:27 pm UTC$0.01  9.58%VeChain, currently ranked #30 by market cap, is up 9.58% over the past 24 hours.

Their price chart has a measurable half-life, like radioactive decay. Plotted on a log chart, it’s a straight line down.”Bitcoin dominance is up from 33.47 to 67 percentSince January 2018, the dominance index of bitcoin, which measures the share of bitcoin over the global crypto market, has doubled from 33.47 to 67 percent.According to data from athcoinindex, Bitcoin is down by 53 percent from its all-time high while most altcoins, including major crypto assets such as Ethereum, XRP, and Bitcoin Cash have dropped by 80 to 95 percent against the U.S. dollar.Bitcoin dominance is up by 2x since January of 2018 as crypto market stagnates (source: coinmarketcap.com)Altcoins outside of the top ten in the likes of Cardano (ADA), Stellar, TRON, and NEO have performed particularly poorly against the U.S. dollar, declining by well over 90 percent.Similar to the equities market, during times of stagnancy and a lack of interest from the general public, investors in the crypto market tend to flock to bitcoin as a less risky option over altcoins.Consequently, Tether, a stablecoin whose value is equivalent to that of the U.S. dollar, has become the fifth most valuable crypto asset in the global market, overtaking Litecoin.While the Bitcoin price is up by 100 percent year-to-date, it is still substantially down from its record high with its volume declining noticeably since its yearly high in June.As reported by CryptoSlate, November has tended to be the best performing month for bitcoin but for two consecutive years, BTC is at risk of recording a net negative in November.Accumulation phase?Ceteris Paribus, a cryptocurrency research team, said that in the 3rd quarter of 2019, Square users bought 133 BTC per day on average, 8.6 percent of daily issuance.About 1,800 new $BTC get mined each day. @Square users bought on average 155/day in Q3, 8.6% of daily new issuance.— Ceteris Paribus (@ceterispar1bus) November 6, 2019Based on the data from the team, around 1,800 BTC is mined every day by mining facilities globally, and the strong sales by Square indicate that investors are accumulating the dominant cryptocurrency.As accumulation increases and the hash rate of Bitcoin continues to increase ahead of the block reward halving, the dominance of BTC is expected to rise even further, possibly into levels unseen since 2017, in the 70 percent area.Whether altcoins will be able to utilize its recent momentum to sustain recovery throughout the year’s end remains uncertain.Bitcoin is facing strong resistance at $9,400, with its $9,200 support level anticipated to be broken with rising sell pressure and sell limit orders on major fiat-to-crypto exchanges like Coinbase.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

212,CryptoSlate,Why the average Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transaction size increased after the Bitmain “civil war”,Joseph Young,1572423420.0,"The average Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transaction size has increased from $7,420 to $24,050 in the aftermath of the controversy surrounding Bitmain.Bitmain has long been a backer of Bitcoin Cash since the emergence of Bitcoin ABC in 2017. As of August 2018, Bitmain is said to have held over one million in BCH, as said by a co-owner of bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org.BITMAIN holding 1M+ BCH is a very powerful statement that they have skin in the game and put their money where their mouth is. It’s a good and calculated move, and it’s not wise to underestimate them.— Cøbra (@CobraBitcoin) August 13, 2018What Bitcoin Cash transaction size increase could meanThis week, Jihan Wu, a co-founder and former CEO of Bitmain, the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining manufacturer, reportedly ousted Micree Zhan, another co-founder of the company.According to local media and investors like Dovey Wan, founding partner at Primitive Ventures, Micree was forced out of the company in an “ugly” way. She said:“Chinese news reported: according to who’s close to the matter, Micree was outcasted in an ugly way, he may consider dump BCH he owns .. which is 1.6M BCH total. This will be extremely irrational if true, it’s nuts.”The increase in the average size of BCH transactions indicates that a growing number of investors are speculating on the possible effect the change-up in the leadership of Bitmain could have on the price of Bitcoin Cash.Data from IntotheBlock shows the average size of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transactions increased (source: intotheblock.com)Some believe that the abrupt alteration in the structure of the firm could endanger the company’s plans to initiate an initial public offering (IPO). Wan added:“According to public record, Jihan Wu took over Micree Zhan as the legal representative of Bitmain in China. Under China law, this means he serves as the legal embodiment of the company, which is a crucial role. Bitmain obviously can’t sit still while Canaan filed IPO.”Others, like the aforementioned co-founder of bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org, said that the “reappointment” of Jihan Wu as the representative of Bitmain could be a solid first step towards the company regaining market share that it has lost.Congratulations to @JihanWu for coming back into his leadership role at BITMAIN. Now he can begin the tough job of gaining back all the market share BITMAIN lost to Halong Mining.— Cøbra (@CobraBitcoin) October 29, 2019With the public’s opinion divided on whether the implication of the Bitmain leadership change is a positive or a negative factor for the firm’s long-term growth trend, the rise in the average Bitcoin Cash transaction size demonstrates that whichever way, most investors expect it to have an impact on BCH.BCH up more than 30% in 7 daysThe price of BCH increased from around $220 to nearly $300 in the past seven days by more than 30 percent against the U.S. dollar.So far, based on the price trend of the asset, it seems that investors are leaning towards the Bitmain fiasco potentially having a positive effect on Bitcoin Cash, as a larger holder of the digital asset.As of now, it remains unclear whether Bitmain would be able to proceed with its plans to IPO in the U.S. market, while its rival Canaan has already filed for an IPO on the Nasdaq.

213,CryptoSlate,"Weiss Ratings: China will never use Bitcoin, EOS is number one rated crypto",Ali Martinez,1572398100.0,"Weiss Crypto Ratings recently stated that China would never use Bitcoin. The comments come after the nation’s Center for Information and Industry Development published the latest edition of its crypto rankings index.The Global Blockchain Technology Assessment IndexChina’s President Xi Jinping recently revealed that he wants his country to “take the leading position in the emerging field of blockchain.” Following Jinping’s remarks, the Vice Chairman of the Center for International Economic Exchanges Huang Qifan stated that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is going to issue the world’s first sovereign cryptocurrency.Now, the country’s Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID), a subsidiary of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, released the 14th edition of the Global Blockchain Technology Assessment Index. Created in May 2018, the index provides better technical consulting services for government agencies, business enterprises, research institutes, and technology developers, according to the CCID.The latest assessments took into consideration 35 of the top cryptocurrency projects and ranked them based on the technology behind them, their applicability, and the type of innovation they bring into the world.The No. 1 spot was taken by EOS, which has been leading the list since the second edition of the rankings. TRON and Ethereum took the No. 2 and No. 3 spots, respectively, after the former moved up one place compared to the previous issue. Surprisingly, Lisk moved up to the No. 7 position while Bitcoin remains in the No. 11 spot.Source: CCID’s Crypto RankingsNEM and GXChain, however, were removed from the index in spite of “a dynamic adjustment mechanism [that] were introduced to regulate the general public chain whose code replace fee is just too low,” said a spokesperson for the CCID.Despite the popularity that the Global Blockchain Technology Assessment Index has in China, Weiss Crypto Ratings dismissed it.Weiss Crypto RatingsIn a tweet, Weiss Crypto Ratings questioned the veracity of CCID’s blockchain index. The firm claimed that the only way EOS could be ranked No. 1 when compared to other cryptocurrencies is by the high levels of centralization it presents.Weiss went as far as to suggest that “China will never use Bitcoin” since this is an “open, decentralized, permissionless, censorship-resistant” cryptocurrency. And, these attributes do not align with what the CCID stands for.Weiss also offers cryptocurrency ratings that are published every week. The company’s grading scheme takes into consideration a model that analyzes multiple data points on each crypto’s investment risk and reward, technology, and adoption in the real world.Under Weiss criteria, Bitcoin and Ethereum have a B- rating while EOS has a C+. Other cryptocurrencies such as TRON and Lisk have a C- and D+, respectively.Source: Weiss Crypto RatingsThe ratings provided by both the CCID and Weiss Crypto Ratings aim to help investors make the right choice when deciding whether to invest in any given cryptocurrency. But, the assessments are not financial advice.As China continues to push the adoption of blockchain technology, Weiss remains skeptical. Weiss Crypto Ratings said:“Chinese take on blockchain is a perversion of the intended use-case for the technology.”Posted In: Bitcoin, EOS, China, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

215,CryptoSlate,"China-based cryptos on the rise: NEO, Ontology, and Qtum technical analysis",Ali Martinez,1572233160.0,"As the Chinese government vows to put the nation at the forefront of blockchain technology, some of the most prominent China-based blockchain projects are skyrocketing. The following technical analysis will evaluate whether NEO, Ontology, and Qtum have the potential for a further advance.NEO, Ontology, and Qtum technical analysisA double bottom or “W” pattern appears to be developing across the 1-month chart of NEO, Ontology, and Qtum. This type of technical formation is usually created at the end of a correction, signaling a change in trend and a reversal of momentum from bearish to bullish. If validated, these cryptocurrencies may continue their bullish impulse.NEO’s double bottom pattern estimates that its bullish trend could soon be resumed if it is able to close above $16.60. If successful, this technical formation will be validated signaling a move higher.On its way up, NEO would have to break through a series of resistance levels that sits at $13, $20, $31, $48.5, and $67. Nevertheless, a spike in the selling pressure behind this cryptocurrency that takes it below $6.5 will invalidate the “W” pattern predicting lower lows.NEO/USD by TradingViewAlong the same lines, Ontology could surge 400 percent if its able to close above $1.53. Moving above this resistance level will confirm the double bottom pattern seen on its 1-month chart. This will imply that ONT could surge higher in the next few months.The bullish outlook could be impeded by the resistance levels that sit in between the current price level and the target, including $2.18, $3, $4.5, and $6.45. However, a break below the recent low of $0.56 could invalidate the double bottom sending this crypto down to make a new all-time low.ONT/USD by TradingViewFinally, Qtum could be preparing for a multi-month upswing that takes it to $22.45. But first, it will have to close above $5. This could be used as a sign of confirmation that the “W” formation that is developing on its monthly chart will be validated.Although it is too early to determine if the pattern will be confirmed, a series of resistance levels must be broken to increase the probability of a 350 percent price increase. These resistance levels are sitting at $6.50, $8.10, $10.40, $13.03, $16.80.Like the other two cryptos previously analyzed, if Qtum moves below the recent low of $1.60 it will put an end to the bullish scenario.QTUM/USD by TradingViewOverall sentimentThe country with the biggest population on the planet is integrating blockchain technology. As a result, the overall sentiment of the market is bullish. Especially, the sentiment around some of the top China-based cryptocurrencies.However, it remains to be seen whether China will allow the implementation of any of these public blockchains. It is entirely possible and most likely that China will not allow any public blockchains to be built on and instead only allow private, permissioned blockchains that they can fully control.In the last four days, NEO surged 95 percent, Ontology 125 percent, and Qtum 77 percent. Now, if the double bottom pattern seen in the 1-month chart of these cryptos is validated, they could soon reach higher highs.Posted In: Neo, China, Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

216,CryptoSlate,Cardano’s Shelley incentivized testnet will launch in November,Priyeshu Garg,1572073320.0,"The incentivized testnet of Shelley, the next iteration of the Cardano blockchain, is set to roll out in November. Users on the incentivized testnet will be able to earn real ADA rewards from staking that will be moved to the mainnet once Shelley officially rolls out.Shelley’s complex PoS protocol requires serious testingAfter teasing its tight-knit community with the launch of an incentivized testnet for the next iteration of Cardano, IOHK has finally released more details on its blog post. The ambitious research-oriented blockchain has frequently been on the receiving end of harsh criticism due to its slow development process but seems to have picked up the pace after celebrating its second birthday earlier in October.Earlier this year, the company launched a testnet for Shelley, a new era of the Cardano blockchain that will bring about staking, and is now set to roll out a new, incentivized version. According to Dynal Patel, senior product manager at Cardano, joining the incentivized testnet will enable all ADA (ADA) holders to earn real ADA rewards.he wrote in a blog post:“This marks an acceleration in the Shelley testnet, and in Cardano’s development.”Patel explained the company decided to launch an incentivized testnet in order to ensure Ouroboros runs smoothly. Ouroboros is an advanced proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol that the company is currently working on. However, the complexity of such a protocol requires “stable and robust foundations,” Patel said, which is why IOHK chose to implement it in an incentivized testnet first.This testnet will enable IOHK to see how Cardano’s incentive mechanism operates in a real-world environment.Anyone can take part in the incentivized testnetAccording to Patel, the incentivized testnet will begin with a snapshot of all the ADA balances held across the mainnet. Any user who holds or transfers their ADA to one of several approved wallets at the time of the snapshot can participate in the incentivized testnet.(Source: IOHK)While the date for the snapshot is yet to be set, Patel confirmed that it will happen sometime in November. To ensure all users are adequately prepared, there will be a test snapshot before the final one.After the snapshot is completed, users will be able to access their testnet wallets the same way they would access their mainnet wallet. Special testnet Daedalus and Yoroi wallets that are visually distinct from their mainnet counterparts will be available, Patel said.Users will then be able to choose how to use funds from their wallets on the incentivized testnet—to delegate or operate a stake pool. The ADA they earn in the testnet cannot be spent, but it will be transferred to the mainnet once it launches.While delegating will require no technical skills, the company said that running a stake pool will require “some technical know-how.” Patel explained in the blog post:“Stake pool operators should be comfortable with command-line interfaces and have some system operation and server administration skills.”For those less familiar with staking, detailed documentation on how to run stake pools will be provided.Users will be able to calculate the approximate rewards for delegating and operating stake pools on a calculator that will be hosted on a dedicated web page. The exact launch time for both the calculator and the timing for November’s balance snapshot will be announced in the following weeks.

217,CryptoSlate,Agoric and Cosmos hash out an interoperable future for 2020 [INTERVIEW],Liam Kelly,1571973360.0,"On Oct. 21, 2019, representatives from Agoric, Tendermint, FOAM, and oscoin gathered at Full Node in Berlin, Germany, to discuss the blockchain space’s current need for interoperability protocols.Although technical in nature, hashing out an inter-blockchain communication standard is as critical as the TCP/IP model was for the Internet. Pundits of both IBC, Cosmos’ interoperability protocol and Parity’s Polkadot further suggest that freeing up siloed data is paramount to building a rich, blockchain economy.Bridging Communities and Siloed DataWhile it appears that crypto Twitter is awash with drama every week, there still exists far less contentious corners of innovation.One such example is the pursuit of an otherwise tokenless interoperability protocol. The Ethereum-centric Polkadot product from Parity, Wanchain 3.0, and Cosmos’s IBC protocol are the current heavy-weights. Adjacent to this friendly competition is also the shared belief that a blockchain-based future will include multiple chains with various use cases.Christopher Goes of Tendermint Research reminded the audience on Monday that such interchain communication “allows specialization and scalability as chains can operate concurrently.”One no longer needs to build one chain to rule them all. Instead, developers can double-down on their ideas knowing that accessory blockchains will be within reach to support their work. This is crucial for companies like FOAM, Agoric, and many others.For its part, FOAM is building a two-way GPS-like technology in which users are incentivized to prove the location of physical objects. This could be museums in Paris or historical monuments in New York. Once a user wants to add a location to the FOAM grid, they must stake tokens. Other users can then follow-up and either confirm or deny the legitimacy of the first user’s suggestion. These data also become immediately available to the public, impervious to spoofing, and allow new businesses to build on top the resilient alternative to centralized mapping services.Companies that might rely on immutable locations include supply chain firms, electric grids, and other communication networks. Without the ability to communicate between systems, however, much of the aggregated value is lost due to inefficiencies. This is one example of how an interoperability protocol could assist.Agoric’s smart contracts proposition also benefits from bridging networks. The CEO of Agoric, Dean Tribble, told CryptoSlate in an interview that his team would even be tinkering with both IBC and Polkadot to reach their ends. Nevertheless, the Agoric testnet has already launched on Tendermint and Cosmos SDK.Tendermint is a byzantine fault-tolerant consensus engine that powers the Cosmos blockchain. Cosmos SDK is a developer’s toolkit that allows anyone to build-out custom blockchains from scratch.The pursuit of an agnostic messaging protocol also comes with a host of social advantages. Because blockchains are not able to interact with one another, token holders of each network are hardpressed to imagine anything but a zero-sum game. This has already played out time and time again in the crypto ecosystem.Dean Tribble of Agoric described interoperability as a critical diplomatic tool. Tribble remarked:“Interoperability between blockchains creates more social bridges between communities. The key to diplomacy is to have open communications.”Agoric also prides itself on opening up smart contract development to the roughly 10.7 million JavaScript software developers through two subsets of JavaScript, Secure EcmaScript (SES) and Jessie. Like its interoperability ambitions, the goal is simple: expand the community.To this Tribble added:“Solidity developers can be slightly too expensive for certain companies looking to experiment with smart contracts. For any long-term industrial use case, say microgrids, paying expensive developers might render your business plan unviable.”Redefining the technical conversation of interoperability to one of social cohesion is certainly welcome in the blockchain space. With a scheduled launch date for early 2020, IBC may finally bring some much needed technical diplomacy to the sector.

218,CryptoSlate,Blockstream CEO says Bitcoin sidechains will kill altcoins,Jonnie Emsley,1571823780.0,"The development of sidechains could transform Bitcoin into an all-useful blockchain protocol and make many altcoins redundant, according to sidechain pioneer and Blockstream CEO Adam Back.Speaking on a panel at Transylvania Crypto Conference, Forbes reported, Back stated that altcoins would have “less credibility” when sidechain technology could facilitate “easy-to-use extension mechanisms” for Bitcoin—that is, allowing developers to augment the original layer-one cryptocurrency with new and innovative features.The comments reaffirm Back’s long-standing reflections on “user-facing applications of sidechains” in the original sidechain whitepaper, authored in 2014 by his Bitcoin development firm Blockstream, which supposed that these parallel systems could offer faster, more sophisticated applications of BTC compared to the “liquidity shortages” and “market fluctuations” associated with smaller-cap altcoins.For the uninitiated, sidechains are standalone protocols linked to the main chain (in this case Bitcoin) via a two-way peg. Assets are locked on the main chain and then represented on the sidechain, where they can be transacted on a less encumbered, supposedly faster, network.The state of sidechainsBack and his colleagues at Blockstream have for years spoken of a time that sidechains would administer the coup de grâce to many of the altcoins that have attempted to outdo Bitcoin in their various ways.Related: Blockstream Launches Liquid Network, Exchanges Can Now Transfer Bitcoin in Under 2 MinutesBlockstream unveiled its first sidechain initiative in October last year, Liquid, a Bitcoin sidechain connecting 23 major crypto exchanges and institutional trading shops. Offering sub-two-minute transactions with privacy features and an “Issued Assets” function for Ethereum-style assetization using the Bitcoin protocol, Liquid would certainly look like a step towards a future built on Bitcoin.But there’s a tradeoff. Liquid uses a federated model that has its 23 members act as nodes for the sidechain, and is thus reliant on a significant degree of centralization—reliant on trust. Rootstock, an open-source sidechain designed to bring smart contract functionality to Bitcoin, has a similar issue, relying on 25 high-profile blockchain companies to secure BTC transactions in and out of the peg wallet.One could look at these types of tradeoffs and draw comparisons to top-10 altcoins like XRP, which, in a similar fashion to Liquid, relies on centralization to increase transactional throughput. Ripple Labs (the company behind XRP) has pushed aggressively for international expansion in recent months, securing a series of high-profile partnerships intended to boost the coin’s reach and liquidity—their strategy seems to be working.Until sidechains can help Bitcoin compete with its rivals in a more decentralized fashion, their usage may be limited to organizations already transacting in BTC.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, People, Privacy, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

219,CryptoSlate,Huobi confirms $40m HT tokens burned in third quarter,Reuben Jackson,1571724240.0,"As part of its quarterly token burning scheme, Huobi Global has announced that it’s burned 11.3 million Huobi Tokens (HT) worth approximately $40m.The Singaporean exchange reports a strong quarter of trading, with continued growth across its spot and derivatives market. The latest burn brings the total HT burned to over 30 million, removing 13.8 percent of circulating supply from the market.Many exchanges operate a buyback and burn system for their tokens, in an attempt to drive demand by limiting the supply. For the preceding two quarters, Huobi has burned more tokens that its biggest competitor, Binance.In Q2 this year, Huobi burned $53.6 million worth of HT, compared to $23.8m BNB. Now that the Q3 results are in, Binance has narrowed the gap by burning $36.7m in BNB, but still over $3m less than Huobi’s third-quarter buyback.In a press release accompanying the announcement, Huobi CEO Livio Weng stated:“The continued growth from Huobi’s token burns reflects the community’s active participation and optimistic outlook for our efforts to provide users with new services, lower fees, and a secure platform to trade on.”A Busy Year for HuobiThe success of the burn reflects a solid three months of trading. Weng points to the platform’s newer offerings as being strong drivers of growth. Huobi has indeed been extremely active in releasing new programs and services for its users over 2019.In March this year, the exchange launched its Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) platform, starting with a sale of the TOP token. Since then, it has conducted five more successful offerings in almost as many months. The IEO has proven to be a surprise hit in blockchain crowdfunding this year, so Huobi made a timely entrance to the space.In June, it launched Fast Track, a service that enables Huobi users to use their HT to cast votes on which tokens should become listed on the exchange. The incentive for users was that their staked tokens would be exchanged for the newly listed ones at a discount on the market rate.Huobi has also introduced a limited-time VIP fee structure called All-Stars, designed to provide the lowest trading fees to those who trade the most on the exchange. This comes alongside the launch of a derivatives trading platform, Huobi DM, and an OTC market.Related: Binance Exec: Bitcoin futures volume rose significantly in 2019, as it raises leverage to 125xHowever, these developments come at a time of intense competition between cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance has also now ventured into the futures market, and most recently, confirmed it would offer some of the highest leverage in the sector. Next year, Digitex futures exchange is set to offer zero-commission trading. Many exchanges, including Bittrex, Bitfinex, and KuCoin, also now offer IEO platforms.Therefore, these third-quarter results demonstrate that Huobi is doing a solid job in keeping pace, maintaining trading volume and user engagement in an increasingly competitive exchange market.Posted In: Huobi, Singapore, Altcoins, Derivatives, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

221,CryptoSlate,Data shows autonomous coin Decred has a Power Law relationship with Bitcoin,Priyeshu Garg,1571293020.0,"Decred, a progressive cryptocurrency focused on governance, seems to have a natural connection to Bitcoin, as everything from its coin supply to price has followed Bitcoin’s ups and downs since 2014.Decred has a deep relationship with BitcoinBitcoin, the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, has inspired thousands of digital assets, all of which were created to solve a particular set of problems.An abbreviation for “Decentralized Credit,” Decred is a hybrid system utilizing both a Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake protocol. It was designed to solve the two largest issues Bitcoin has—scalability and governance. The main value proposition Decred brings is almost identical to that of Bitcoin—a maximum supply of 21 million coins and a deterministic supply schedule set by block height.And while the coin was created to mirror Bitcoin in theory, data has shown that it also has a real-life relationship with Bitcoin. Checkmate, an on-chain analyst for Decred and ReadySetCrypto, pointed out that Decred has a Power Law relationship with Bitcoin.The Power Law, sometimes referred to as the scaling law, is a term used to describe the functional relationship between two quantities. The law states that a relative change in one quantity results in the proportional relative change in the other quantity.Where Bitcoin goes Decred followsPrevious research by Checkmate illustrated various other similarities between Decred and Bitcoin. With a deterministic supply schedule and the same maximum coin supply, Decred’s overall supply curve looks a lot like that of Bitcoin.Decred Supply Curves via MediumThe data shows that the two coins should reach the same circulating supply in Q1 2038.Apart from that, Decred’s stock-to-flow ratio follows the same set of values Bitcoin does. The ratio is traditionally used to measure the abundance of traditional commodities such as gold or silver and represents the amount of the commodity held in inventories divided by the amount of produced annually.When applied to fixed-supply coins such as Bitcoin and Decred, the ratio is used as a measure of scarcity and value. The higher the ratio is the scarcer the asset is, and the more consistent the ratio is, the more resistant the asset is to inflation.According to Checkmate, Decred has shown a statistically significant relationship between Stock-to-Flow and a market valuation that traverses the same set of stock-to-flow ratio as Bitcoin does.Bitcoin and Decred Supply Characteristics via MediumBut, despite the rock-solid data, market sentiment is still the strongest force driving the crypto market.

223,CryptoSlate,Telegram hit by SEC emergency action for its $1.7 billion token offering,Mitchell Moos,1570784460.0,"The entities behind Telegram and its $1.7 billion ICO were hit by an emergency action and restraining order by the SEC for failing to register its Gram token as a security.The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission is alleging that the companies behind Telegram and its initial coin offering have been conducting an unregistered securities offering. Telegram first began raising capital in January 2018 to build their own blockchain, the “Telegram Open Network,” also known as the “TON” blockchain.To date, Telegram sold 2.9 billion Gram tokens to 171 purchasers worldwide, with more than a third of those tokens, worth some $590 million, going to 39 U.S. investors, according to the release.Telegram promised to deliver the Gram tokens on the launch of its blockchain, no later than Oct. 31, 2019. After which Telegram would “sell billions of Grams into U.S. markets.”  Reporting from TechCrunch reaffirmed that Telegram was planning to sell its tokens to retail investors as early as October.The complaint made by the SEC alleges that the entities behind Telegram failed to register their offer and sale of the Gram token, “which are securities, in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.”Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC’s division of enforcement had this to say about the action:“We have repeatedly stated that issuers cannot avoid the federal securities laws just by labeling their product a cryptocurrency or a digital token. Telegram seeks to obtain the benefits of a public offering without complying with the long-established disclosure responsibilities designed to protect the investing public.”The complaint was formally filed in New York’s federal district court of Manhattan and charges the entities behind Telegram with violating several provisions of the U.S. Securities Act. Consequently, the SEC is seeking certain emergency relief, permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against the actors involved.Posted In: Altcoins, ICOs, Regulation     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

224,CryptoSlate,"Altcoins including TRON, Cardano, Chainlink on the run",Ali Martinez,1570693740.0,"Some of the top altcoins by market capitalization—including TRON, Cardano, and Chainlink—began surging over the last few hours. As they absorb a bigger share of the market it could mark the beginning of a new altseason.Market dominanceThe altcoin market share has mostly been contained within an ascending parallel channel since June 2013. From that point on, every time it reaches the bottom of the channel it bounces off to the middle or the top. But, when it reaches the top it falls back to the middle or the bottom. On Jan. 13, 2018, altcoin dominance nearly touched the top of the ascending parallel channel and since then it went through a steep correction plummeting over 57 percent. After peaking at a 67.55 percent dominance, altcoins went down to hit the bottom of the channel at 28.78 percent on Sept. 6, 2019. As it was seen before, the bottom of the channel served as a rebound zone, once again allowing altcoin dominance to rise to 18 percent. Coincidentally, this is also where the 61.8 and 65 percent Fibonacci retracement zones sit. This Fibonacci retracement level is considered by many traders as the ‘golden’ retracement area due to the higher probability of a rebound. The altcoins market share has indeed bounced off this area and now it could be on its way up to regain the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level as support. Such a bullish impulse could take altcoins to overtake 40 percent of the market share, signaling a new altseason. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance will have to pull back to around 60 percent.Altcoin Dominance by CoinTraderSince the beginning of the year, Bitcoin dominance has also been contained within an ascending parallel channel. Due to its inability to recently break above the middle line of the channel, Bitcoin’s dominance is retracing. This correction could take it to the bottom of the channel, where the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level sits at. A move below this level of support will increase the odds for Bitcoin dominance to test the next level of support around the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level. This coincides with one of the most recent reports by Binance that suggests that BTC dominance will go back to the 60 percent range.“We still believe in this, partly because BTC dominance was below 60 percent for an extended period, from May 2017 until June 2019. It has only been in the past three months or so that BTC dominance has shot up so dramatically, and the crypto-world has found its way of making everyone feel like a prisoner of the moment. Short-term wise, though, BTC dominance may be sticking around,” reads the report.Bitcoin Dominance by TradingViewAlthough it is too early to tell whether the next altseason has begun, some of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap have already started moving upward. Altcoins on the runEthereum, for instance, is up nearly 7 percent after breaking out of a no-trade zone where it had been sitting since Sept. 30. This range was defined by the $182.80 resistance level and the $166.70 support level. Now that ETH moved to the upside, it reached the first price hurdle at $195. And, it could continue ascending to hit the next level of resistance at $205. Along the same lines, Bitcoin Cash rose 4 percent after it moved above the $232 resistance level. A further spike in volume could take BCH to $271 or even $292.ETH/USD by TradingViewLitecoin was also sitting in a no-trade zone after the 25 percent plunge it experienced on Sept. 24. But, it now seems to be on its way up to $64 or $71.Following a two weeks consolidation period, Binance Coin appears to be breaking out as well. This crypto is currently up 8 percent from the $16.40 barrier that was containing its price. If it continues rising it may find resistance around $18.30 and $20.LTC/USD by TradingViewCardano broke above $0.040 and reached the first target at $0.043. The next resistance level for this cryptocurrency sits at $0.048.ADA/USD by TradingViewFinally, Ontology’s price action is behaving similarly to the cryptocurrencies previously analyzed. This crypto appears to be surging and could likely hit $0.685 or $0.774 soon. Biggest gainersAs most of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap consolidated following the drop of Sept. 24, two of them were able to outperform the rest of the market. After hitting a low of $0.012 on Sept. 24, TRON quickly recovered and is currently up 50 percent. Nonetheless, in its 12-hour chart a spinning top candlestick pattern appears to be developing. This candlestick formation could be signaling a trend reversal. If validated, TRX could go down to $0.015. TRX/USD by TradingViewAdditionally, Chainlink reached a low of $1.48 on Sept. 24 and surged over 100 percent since then. Now, the TD sequential indicator is presenting a sell signal (in the form of a green nine) on its 12-hour chart estimating that a retracement is underway. If confirmed, the selling pressure behind LINK could increase, taking it to test the next level of support around $2.20. Overall sentimentAs seen in this technical analysis, some of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are starting to resume their bullish trends. Even though most of them surged between 4 and 8 percent over the last few hours, others have seen significant gains in the last two weeks.

225,CryptoSlate,Qtum prepares for version 2.0 in its first hard fork upgrade,Ali Martinez,1570147920.0,"Qtum is preparing for its first hard fork since its inception back in September 2017. The system upgrade is focused on the underlying technology behind the protocol. Dubbed Qtum 2.0, it aims to integrate a number of functions and improvements to its blockchain.Qtum 2.0On Oct. 17, 2019, at block 466,600, a system upgrade in the form of a hard fork will be activated on Qtum’s Mainnet. The improvements are based on a series of recommendations made by developers and community members that tackle certain aspects of its underlying technology.Thus far, four different consensus-related Qtum Improvement Proposals (QIP) have been approved and will be included in the upcoming hard fork.The first will add signature verification to the output script of the contract transaction. At the moment, addresses are required to have a small balance of QTUM in order to send and even receive any given amount of Qtum or QRC20 tokens. This upgrade will improve the user experience of transacting by allowing addresses to send and receive to smart contracts without QTUM balances.The second upgrade will integrate precompiled contracts to the Qtum Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Adding these type of contracts simplifies the development process and reduces the amount of transaction fees (gas) that is spent when using smart contracts.The third improvement to the Qtum protocol is directly related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Since Qtum has never gone through a hard fork its version of the EVM is outdated. Thus, this upgrade will allow it to catch up with the new features that Byzantine and Constantinople have brought to Ethereum, enabling more complex applications.Finally, Qtum will modify the difficulty adjustment algorithm of its proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. The idea is to change the long block intervals to 128 seconds. This will increase the transaction speed on the network as well as improve block rewards for staking wallets by 12.5 percent.CryptoSlate reached out to Jackson Belove, blockchain researcher at Qtum, who said that the code is now ready for launch after having been “extensively tested” over the last six months. However, the upgrade will only apply to Qtum Core wallets.“The [upcoming] hard fork only applies to the Qtum Core wallets Qtum-Qt and qtumd, no other wallets. While updated wallets will make the hard fork automatically, users that don’t update in time will see their Qtum Core wallets disconnected from the main network, will not be able to make transactions, and (for staking wallets) may see their coins staked on a split chain, where they are difficult to recover,” explained Belove.Despite the proximity of Qtum’s systemwide upgrade market movement for QTUM has been lackluster. In fact, it recently hit levels not seen since December 2018.Qtum technical analysisQtum made it back to the $1.42 support level. This represents a complete retracement of the 312 percent price increase that this crypto experienced throughout the year. Although the bears seem to be in control, the upcoming hard fork may bring some bulls with it.A double bottom could be forming on Qtum’s 1-day chart. This technical pattern develops at the end of a correction, signaling a change in trend and a reversal of momentum from bearish to bullish. If validated, Qtum could be preparing for a major price move that takes it to even higher price levels than the ones seen so far this year. Everything will depend on the success of Qtum 2.0 and whether the event stimulates buying pressure.If Qtum is indeed bound for an upswing, it could find resistance on its way up around $2.14, $3.40 and $5.92. However, if the selling pressure behind this cryptocurrency increases it will likely make a new all-time low. Breaking below the $1.42 support cluster could trigger a 20 percent correction down to $1.13 or even lower.QTUM/USD by TradingViewReady for launchQtum is on the cusp of its first hard fork, which will be directed at improving the underlying technology behind its protocol. It will add new smart contract capabilities, reduce long block spacing, and give staking wallets a 12.50 percent raise. As stated by Jackson Belove, the code is ready to be launched on the Qtum’s Mainnet after several months of “planning, preparation and testing.” The system upgrade will be activated on Oct. 17, 2019, and hopefully, will give Qtrum the boost it needs.

226,CryptoSlate,"Indicator suggests high volatility for ETH, LTC, BNB, ADA, XMR, DASH, ONT",Ali Martinez,1570078440.0,"One of the most popular technical indexes among traders suggests that some of the top altcoins by market capitalization—including Ethereum, Litecoin, Binance Coin, Cardano, Monero, Dash, and Ontology—are on the cusp of high volatility.The next major price swingOver the last week the cryptocurrency market entered a consolidation period following a steep market decline on Sept. 24.That day approximately $50 billion was wiped out from total crypto market capitalization, representing a 20 percent plunge from a high of $250 billion to a low of $200 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin saw its price plummet over 17 percent flashing a potential move to $6,500.Crypto market capitalization by TradingViewNow, the market seems to have stabilized within a trading range and a particular indicator is signaling that a period of high volatility is on the horizon.The Bollinger bands, a technical analysis tool defined by a set of two standard deviation lines and a simple moving average, appears to be squeezing on the 4-hour charts of some of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Squeezes are indicative of periods of low volatility and are typically succeeded by periods of high volatility. The longer the squeeze the higher the probability of a strong breakout that defines the direction of the trend.This technical index does not necessarily specify whether a given cryptocurrency will move up or down. Nonetheless, a series of support and resistance levels can be drawn to help simplify possible bearish and bullish scenarios.Bearish or bullish?Ethereum, for instance, is currently sitting in a no-trade zone. This area is defined by the lower and upper Bollinger band that sit around $166.70 and $182.80, respectively. Trading within these support and resistance levels poses high risk exposure. Therefore, as the Bollinger Bands continue squeezing on ETH’s 4-hour chart, it will be wiser to wait for a clear move outside of this range. A break below $166.70 could take this cryptocurrency to test the next levels of support around $157 and $147. Conversely, a move above $182.80 could allow Ethereum to surge up to the $195 or $205 resistance level.Along the same lines, Bitcoin Cash has mostly traded between $214 and $232 since Sept. 25. This is a reasonable no-trade zone as a break outside of this area will likely be followed by a strong price impulse. So, if BCH moves below $214 it may hit the next price barrier at $173.50 or $145. On the other hand, a spike in volume that lets this cryptocurrency rise above $232 could take it to $271 or even $292.ETH/USD by TradingViewLitecoin is also trading between the same support and resistance levels after the 25 percent drop that it experienced on Sept. 24. In fact, this cryptocurrency has not been able to move below $53 or above $57.70 since then. Consequently, breaking the current support level could push LTC further down to $49 or $44, but if it breaks above resistance it could raise up to $64 or $71.Despite the different announcements that Binance made recently, its native currency is consolidating like the rest of the market. At the moment, Binance Coin is moving between $14.70 and $16.40, but breaking through this zone will determine where it is heading next. On the upside, the next price hurdles sit at $18.30 and $20. On the downside, however, the next resistance levels are are around $12 and $10.LTC/USD by TradingViewThe Bollinger bands are also squeezing on Bitcoin SV’s 4-hour chart. While the lower band sits around $80.50, the upper band sits around $89.50. As long as this technical indicator continues squeezing the action between these price points can be considered as a no-trade zone. Breaking below it could take BSV down to $74 or $64.50. Meanwhile, an increase in the buying pressure behind this cryptocurrency could take it to $111 or $127.80.Moreover, as Cardano slowly transitions into proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus its market valuation continues consolidating between $0.036 and $0.040. ADA’s next major price swing will depend on its ability to trade outside of this trading range. Falling below $0.036 could take it to $0.031 or $0.028 while surging above $0.040 will likely let it test the $0.043 or $0.048 resistance level.BSV/USD by TradingViewMonero’s 4-hour chart tells a similar story. Currently, this privacy coin is inside a $4 no-trade zone between $54.60 and $58.60. A spike in the selling pressure behind XMR could cause it to plunge to $50 or $44.80. On the other hand, jumping above $58.60 could let Monero rise to $66.40 or $71.Dash also awaits a spike in volume that allows it to breakthrough the consolidation phase that began on Sept. 25. For this cryptocurrency, moving below $66.80 could imply a further correction down to $59 or even $52. Conversely, moving above $73 will likely bring the necessary volume to take it up to $79 or $87.XMR/USD by TradingViewEthereum Classic appears to be signaling a retracement to the lows of December 2018. However, it will be wiser to wait for a clear direction of its trend before entering a trade. As its market valuation remains between $4.45 and $4.90, the Bollinger bands on ETC’s 4-hour chart will continue squeezing. Moving below support could take it down to $4.20 or $3.80 while moving above resistance could take it up to $5.45 or $6.Finally, Ontology’s price action is behaving similar to the cryptocurrencies previously analyzed. This crypto has been contained between $0.626 and $0.570 since Sept. 25. An increase in the selling pressure behind ONT could take it to $0.504 or $0.447. But, if it breaks above $0.570 it could likely surge to $0.685 or $0.774.ETC/USD by TradingViewThe market decidesAs seen in this technical analysis, some of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are all trading within narrow ranges. Under these conditions it is unknown the direction that the market will take. Therefore, it will be wiser to wait for a clear break of support or resistance before entering any trade.But, based on the Bollinger bands it seems like a break could happen soon. This technical index is in its squeezing stage throughout the charts analyzed, forecasting a period of high volatility. As the market decides where it will be heading next patience will play a key role for traders who want to benefit from the next major price swing.Posted In: Altcoins, Privacy, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

227,CryptoSlate,"Chainlink, Tezos and Ethereum Classic show mixed signals, but one of three is bullish",Ali Martinez,1569982260.0,"Although many altcoins hit bottoms not seen since 2017, others such as Chainlink, Tezos, and Ethereum Classic could regain their bullish trends and reach higher highs. Take a look at the technical analysis.ChainlinkBack in early July, the TD sequential indicator predicted that Chainlink was due for a major correction based on its 1-week chart. The bearish signal (in the form of a green nine) was then validated and LINK plummeted nearly 70 percent from a high of $4.80 to a low of $1.47. After such a steep correction, this technical index is now forecasting that this cryptocurrency may be bound for an upswing.As a matter of fact, the TD sequential indicator recently presented a red nine candlestick, which is a buy signal. This, in combination with a spinning top candlestick and a move above the 7-week moving average, represent strong evidence that LINK could soon experience a bullish impulse.LINK/USD by TradingViewAdding to the bullishness, the 61.8 and 65 percent Fibonacci retracement zone was able to contain the price of LINK from a further decline. This Fibonacci retracement area is considered by many traders as the ‘golden’ retracement zone due to the high probability of a rebound.Yet, Chainlink has to experience a greater buying pressure to allow it to bounce off this area. If volume indeed picks up, LINK could have the potential to reach the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement zone that sits at $2.48.Nonetheless, an increase in selling pressure could take this crypto to break below the ‘golden’ retracement zone. This will be considered as a trend reversal from bullish to bearish with the potential to take LINK down to the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level, around $1.15.Chainlink’s 1-day chart also seems bullish when looking at the moving averages. At the moment, LINK is trying to regain the 150-day moving average as support. If successful, it could then try and test the resistance given by the 100-day moving average.Moreover, LINK appears to have formed a double bottom pattern under this timeframe. This technical pattern develops at the end of a correction, signaling a change in trend and a momentum reversal from bearish to bullish. As a result, everything seems to point to a bullish scenario for Chainlink. Based on the indicators, LINK could experience a bullish impulse that takes it up at least 28 percent to test the 100-day moving average and the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement zone.TezosFollowing a nearly 100 percent bounce off the golden retracement zone, Tezos pulled back to the area once again. Now, an inverted hammer appears to be developing on its 1-week chart that could trigger another rebound from current price levels. This type of technical pattern usually occurs at the bottom of downtrends and tends to push the price upwards, reversing the bearish trend.Nevertheless, the strength of the 61.8 and 65 percent Fibonacci retracement zone has weakened since this is the second time XTZ has tested it.If this cryptocurrency is indeed bound for an upswing then the buying pressure behind it must increase to allow it to break above the next level of resistance around the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement, that sits at $1.10. Otherwise, it could break below the golden retracement zone, which will ignite a further correction down to the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level, $0.64.XTZ/USD by TradingViewWhen looking at the 3-day chart, Tezos could actually be continuing its trajectory within a descending parallel channel. At the moment, this cryptocurrency appears to be testing the resistance given by the middle line of the channel. Breaking above this area will likely accelerate the buying pressure behind XTZ, taking it to the top of the channel, which is also at $1.10. Conversely, if the middle line of the channel is able to reject the price of Tezos then it could trigger a steeper decline to the bottom of the channel, around $0.73 or lower.Ethereum ClassicEthereum Classic appears to be signaling a retracement to the lows of December 2018. This is due to the formation of a head-and-shoulders pattern on its 3-day chart.ETC recently broke below the neckline of the pattern validating its bearish scenario. Now, this cryptocurrency could be on its way down to $3.20, which is the target given by the head-and-shoulders pattern. This is calculated by measuring the height from the neckline to the head of the formation.Nonetheless, the TD sequential is currently on a red eight and could soon present a buy signal in the form of a red nine. If this bullish signal is confirmed, Ethereum Classic could move up to the neckline before continuing its downtrend.ETC/USD by TradingViewA similar bearish outlook is given on ETC’s 1-day chart where a bear flag is developing. This is considered a continuation pattern that formed after the 25 percent plunge ETC experienced on Sept. 24, known as the flagpole—which was succeeded by the current consolidation period, known as the flag.If this bearish formation is confirmed, it is likely that Ethereum Classic will end up moving in the same direction as the previous trend—predicting a 25 percent drop from the breakout point (determined by measuring the height of the flagpole).Since this cryptocurrency is currently testing the support given by 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement area, a spike in the selling pressure could take it to the December 2018 low of $3.30. However, if ETC is able to move above $5 it could jeopardize the bearish scenarios previously presented and surge to the 65 percent Fibonacci retracement level, $5.60.Overall sentimentThe cryptocurrencies analyzed above have vastly different outlooks. Chainlink, for instance, appears to be bullish while Tezos is neutral and Ethereum Classic is bearish. This appears to be correlated with the current state of the market, with Bitcoin seemingly on the cusp of surging to $9,800 or dropping to $6,500. Due to the uncertainty, it will be wiser to wait for confirmation before entering any trade.Nonetheless, it is worth paying attention to the bullish signals presented on Chainlink’s charts as well as the bearish signals on Ethereum Classic’s charts. Since both of these cryptocurrencies appear to have a clear path on their trend, trading them could pose less risk than trading Tezos, which looks more ambiguous.Posted In: Tezos, Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

228,CryptoSlate,"Hedera Hashgraph sacrifices decentralization for high throughput, says developer",Priyeshu Garg,1568943420.0,"Hedera Hashgraph could be making fundamental tradeoffs to achieve its touted 10,000+ transactions per second. These tradeoffs make it one of the most centralized networks on the market, argues well-known crypto developer Eric Wall.A buzzword-powered blockchain that wants to change the worldLess than a year old, the Hedera Hashgraph network has been marketed as a game-changer for blockchain. The network, which has been locked in a testing environment since December 2018, was backed by some of the largest corporations in the world after promising incredibly fast transactions and unprecedented scalability.After 9 months of testing, the mainnet beta was opened to the public on Sept. 17, allowing anyone to open an account or build a decentralized app on the blockchain. The beta version offers users unprecedented speed—up to 10,000 transactions per second, whereas Bitcoin currently processes around 4 tps. For reference, Visa has a theoretical capacity of 65,000 tps.To achieve high throughput, Hedera Hashgraph completely removed blocks and the process of validating transactions. All network participants are directly connected to each other and confirm the transactions in the form of messages.And while the innovative proposition managed to attract the backing of some of the largest corporations in the world, including Boeing, IBM, and Deutsche Telekom, the network has been heavily criticized by crypto developers.Eric Wall, a crypto writer and developer, explained that the tradeoffs Hedera Hashgraph made in order to achieve the incredible 10,000 tps throughput should scare off both investors and traders.Hedera Hasgraph is now the #7 largest cryptocurrency in terms of valuation (Y2050 fully diluted market cap).Most investors are of the impression that HH is a paradigm shift in DLT tech when in reality it's just doing the classic trick of trading off validation for throughput. https://t.co/DaZzTpVKXN— Eric Wall IS RIGHT (@ercwl) September 17, 2019In a lengthy Twitter thread, Wall explained that Hashgraph, which is now valued at $6 billion, is leveraging “top-shelf tricks” such as touting corporate partnerships and focusing on buzzwords to achieve such a high valuation.It's also leveraging some other real top-shelf tricks which we've seen before:– Partnerships! (Boeing, IBM, Nomura)– DAG!It added some new ones too though:– Coq proof by Carnegie Mellon Professor of it's BFT algo (theorem prover)– Closed source– Patents— Eric Wall IS RIGHT (@ercwl) September 17, 2019Centralized, permissioned, and slowWall believes that the only way hashgraph can be capable of going more than 10,000 transactions per second is by removing the ability to validate the system.But no, that's not it. It had nothing to do with it. They just traded off your ability to validate the system so they could run a smaller network with high TPS.This is the super-classic trick, I'm surprised it worked in 2019. But it worked because of those few tweaks above.— Eric Wall IS RIGHT (@ercwl) September 17, 2019While some argued that transactions on the hashgraph could be validated at a later stage when Hedera introduces “state proofs,” Wall said that this type of validation is no guarantee that the rules and monetary policy of the network will be enacted.""Eric, this is false, everyone can validate the consensus via 'state proofs' when Hedera enables them later!""Eh, no. Validating ""state proofs"" doesn't guarantee that the *rules* and the *monetary policy* hasn't been broken. It's just Hedera saying ""this is legit we promise"".— Eric Wall IS RIGHT (@ercwl) September 17, 2019Basically if bitcoin worked like this, miners could agree to change the rules, steal coins, print money, or do whatever they like. You receive a ""state proof"" that says ""yeah the miners really agrees that this should happen"". You accept it.So basically, the whole point ruined.— Eric Wall IS RIGHT (@ercwl) September 17, 2019However, one of the most interesting things Wall found was the fact that Hedera’s 10,000 tps number doesn’t actually apply to all transactions. He pointed out that the network could, in theory, handle more than 10,000 account to account token transfers.Actually, citing that 10,000+ TPS number to mean ""account-to-account token transfers"" (tested in a closed network without any client-side validation possible, by the way) is another innovation that Hedera Hashgraph did in their marketing materials. Forgot about that. pic.twitter.com/CLV8siEQPx— Eric Wall IS RIGHT (@ercwl) September 17, 2019To get a clear picture of the number of transactions per second the Hedera can handle, it’s best to look at the decentralized applications built on the network. Wall said that dapps that use smart contracts can handle around 10 tps, which is less than the often-congested Ethereum.Oh, and by the way, if you don't care about my ""ideological criticism"", look up how many TPS a dapp in Hedera can do that uses smart contract logic (Hint: it's 10 TPS, less than Ethereum). 10,000+ TPS is just a figure they gave for account-to-account transfers.— Eric Wall IS RIGHT (@ercwl) September 17, 2019(ource: MediumBut, it’s worth noting that the sacrifices Hedera made could be acceptable to many. The company’s partnerships with multi-billion dollar corporations must have gone through at least some due diligence, especially when it comes to safety.Wall acknowledged this but raised an interesting question. Even if the tradeoffs were worth it, was there a need for a native Hedera cryptocurrency? He believes that the network could have had more success as a sidechain for a more liquid network, such as Bitcoin.Even if you do think that the tradeoffs Hedera are doing are worth it, why does it needs its own native currency? Why don't you just set up Hedera as a sidechain to e.g. bitcoin like Liquid and gain all the monetary benefits from using the most liquid cryptocurrency out there?— Eric Wall IS RIGHT (@ercwl) September 17, 2019All of this will render HBAR, Hedera’s native coin, obsolete, he argues.Wake up. It's 2019 and you bought into a 2017-style shitcoin project because someone threw new fancy words at you. Enterprises aren't going to adopt your $HBAR token, sorry. If anything, they care so little about actual decentralization they'll just use a stablecoin on Hedera.— Eric Wall IS RIGHT (@ercwl) September 17, 2019A deep-dive into Hedera showed that the young network still has a lot to show for. Its inability to deliver on the ambitious promises made last year could have been what caused the price of HBAR to drop more than 80 percent just two days after it began trading.

229,CryptoSlate,"Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin stage major recoveries indicating the start of a new altseason",Ali Martinez,1568979600.0,"Altcoins such as Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin are finally showing significant moves, regaining some of the market dominance they lost to Bitcoin year-to-date. If the trend continues it could mark the beginning of a new “altseason.”Market DominanceBitcoin’s market share began rising Dec. 2018. Following a 327 percent upswing, BTC went from $3,200 to nearly $14,000 in a matter of six months. During that time, its dominance broke out of an ascending triangle that was forming on its 1-week chart.Per the bullish formation, BTC was expected to experience a 38.7 percent upswing that could have taken it to 80 percent market share, similar to what Max Keiser, host of RT’s Keiser Report, forecasted.Bitcoin rose to levels of dominance not seen since 2017, peaking at 73.4 percent market share. Now, BTC dominance moved below the 71.5 percent support level and the 200-week moving average, signaling a further correction down to the 150-week moving average. This coincides with the most recent report by Binance, suggesting that BTC dominance will go back to the 50–60 percent range.“We still believe in this, partly because BTC dominance was below 60 percent for an extended period, from May 2017 until June 2019. It has only been in the past three months or so that BTC dominance has shot up so dramatically, and the crypto-world has found its way of making everyone feel like a prisoner of the moment. Short-term wise, though, BTC dominance may be sticking around,” reads the report.Due to the fact that assets that break out of ascending triangle patterns usually reverse to the breakout point, the bearish scenario for BTC dominance doesn’t seem unlikely.BTC dominace by TradingViewIn fact, the altcoin dominance 1-week chart tells a similar story. At the moment, altcoin dominance is sitting in the ‘golden’ retracement area based on the Fibonacci retracement indicator.Since Jan. 2018, altcoin dominance plummeted over 57 percent to reach the 61.8 and 65 percent Fibonacci retracement zone. This area represents a pivotal point for the altcoin dominance trend. A significant correction, like the one just experienced to this level, suggests that a rebound could be underway.In addition, altcoin dominance has been trading inside an ascending parallel channel since March 2014. Since that point, every time it reaches the bottom of the channel it bounces off to the middle or the top; when it reaches the top it falls back to the bottom. Currently, altcoins are trading at the bottom of the ascending parallel channel, adding credibility to a potential rebound that could trigger a new “altseason.”If these bullish signals are validated, altcoin dominance could surge to the 50, 38.2 or even the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level. This implies that altcoin dominance has the opportunity to hit a market share of 40 to 55 percent.Signs of a new “altseason”Despite the indicators, it is unknown when a new “altseason” will take place. What is known is that over the last few days Bitcoin is staggering while altcoins are surging.Based on its 1-week chart, Bitcoin entered a consolidation phase after peaking at nearly $14,000 on June 26. As a result, a symmetrical triangle formed under this time frame presenting opposing views about the future market valuation of BTC.This technical formation represents a period of consolidation before the price is forced to breakout in a negative or positive trend. A move below the lower trendline marks the start of a new bearish trend. Meanwhile, a move above the upper trendline indicates the start of a new bullish trend.By measuring the distance between the initial high and low, the symmetrical triangle predicts a 34.5 percent target in both directions. Thus, if the selling pressure behind BTC increases it could drop the price down to $6,400. Conversely, a spike in volume could result in a breakout that takes BTC up to $13,400.BTC/USD by TradingViewWhile Bitcoin is still figuring out in which direction it will move altcoins have already started rising.Ethereum, for instance, is breaking out of a falling wedge pattern that developed on its 1-week chart. In combination with a buy signal (in the form of a green nine) per the TD sequential indicator, ETH could be targeting a 38 percent surge to hit $242. If the buying pressure behind this cryptocurrency increases it could even reach $300 in the following weeks.ETH/USD by TradingViewXRP experienced a 27 percent upswing in the last few days, which took it to regain the $0.30 level as support. Now, if XRP is able to move above $0.33 it could try to test the next levels of resistance around $0.38, $0.42 and $0.47.XRP/USD by TradingViewFinally, Litecoin was able to bounce off the “golden” retracement area, based on the Fibonacci retracement indicator, and is up 15 percent. And, because of the potential the Fibonacci retracement zone has to reverse its trend, LTC could soon trade at $85 or even $100.LTC/USD by TradingViewOverall SentimentThe significant altcoin upswing over the last few days can be seen across the entire market, with tokens such as Stellar Lumens surging more than 50 percent over the last week. It seems like altcoins are taking the spotlight in preparation for a new “altseason” while Bitcoin continues consolidating. If this is the case, altcoin dominance could rise to 40 percent.It is worth noting that Bakkt is currently preparing to offer its physically-settled Bitcoin futures. This could bring an influx of capital that allows BTC to reach new yearly highs as trading volume increases. Hence, it will be wise to keep an eye on Bitcoin since it may soon experience higher levels of volatility.Posted In: Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

230,CryptoSlate,"Genesis Capital CEO: institutional lending, crypto credit bubbles, and why nobody’s shorting Bitcoin [INTERVIEW]",Jonnie Emsley,1568607840.0,"Genesis Capital, the lending arm of institutional OTC cryptocurrency firm Genesis Trading, just might be the biggest champion of the 2018 bear market, having built a multi-billion-dollar business off the back of Bitcoin’s 70 percent decline.CryptoSlate sat down with the CEO of Genesis Capital and Genesis Trading, Michael Moro, to learn more about why and how the largest stakeholders in crypto are buying and borrowing in a rapidly institutionalizing market.18 months, $3+ billion in loansA lending business was a calculated move for Digital Currency Group-owned Genesis Trading, who in 2013 set up shop in New York as one of the industry’s first over-the-counter (OTC) market makers dealing in large-ticket trades for high net worth individuals and institutions.But it wasn’t until 2018, according to Moro, that the crypto market saw the entrance of “sophisticated” participants wanting to actively trade, and that meant wanting to borrow to take positions on both sides of the market.“Because of 2017 and the crazy price run, we had a lot more sophisticated investors. The traditional buy and hold guys, they were always there. What we didn’t have was the more sophisticated institutional hedge funds that first got their feet wet in 2017, and could take advantage of a lending market in 2018.”Related: Bitcoin Shorts Reach ATH, is a Short Squeeze Incoming?The timing of Genesis Capital’s March 2018 launch then—as Bitcoin set in for what would be a steep yearlong downtrend—catapulted the business to success, according to Moro, who added “there’s no question” that his firm’s boom in trade was driven by institutions borrowing to go short and capitalize on Bitcoin’s descent.18 months on, the business would be the largest known lender in crypto—having originated more than $3 billion in crypto and cash loans, said Moro, with an additional half-billion dollars worth currently outstanding.Who’s borrowing from Genesis Capital, and why?Hedge funds shorting Bitcoin may have built a platform for Moro’s lending business, but the game has matured as the market has developed.Market-neutral strategyNow, there are market-neutral funds borrowing to balance their exposure between long and short positions. But apparently, shorting the spot price of BTC is no longer part of this strategy. Moro explained:“The guys that were shorting Bitcoin in 2018—no one’s shorting Bitcoin today. Bitcoin’s almost become the base pair, and it does what it does. People aren’t shorting the spot. However, what people will do, is short the alts.”Related: Will banks inevitably control the cryptocurrency market?This is unmistakably the case in the interbank Foreign Exchange market, where the US Dollar is used as a base currency and any meaningful action on the short side goes on in the fiat ‘alts,’ the Euro, the British Pound, and so forth. It seems Bitcoin has gone the same way.Remarkably, Moro suggested altcoins are being put in their “pecking order” by institutional traders like his clients, who will short them back to their perceived fair value. They will not, however, sell Bitcoin to take their short positions (opting to use stablecoins instead.)“Relative to how Bitcoin performs, they’ll short Litecoin, or XRP, or Ethereum. If Bitcoin went up 5 percent in a day, and say Litecoin goes up 10 percent, they’ll short Litecoin back down. They’re almost putting things back into the relative valuation that these investors have made up in their mind, as in ‘here’s how the pecking order goes.’”ArbitrageThe growth of Bitcoin’s futures market has added another dynamic to the lending scene.“Arbitrage guys,” said Moro, will borrow to capitalize on spot-futures spreads, as well as the classic spot-spot arbitrage between exchanges. In a bull market where futures contracts tend to trade at a “pretty good premium” to spot, Genesis Capital tends to lend dollars heavily as clients look to go short on the futures market.Crypto loans for working capitalPerhaps the most radical clients of Genesis are businesses whose working capital is denominated in Bitcoin, who make up around 20percent of the firm’s loan volume borrowing to finance business expenses and expansion.Instead of going to a standard small-medium enterprise lender, and then converting the cash to BTC, Moro explained it’s more “straightforward” when they take out a loan in BTC with Genesis.Avoiding a crypto “credit bubble”Fledgling startups and funds may have to look elsewhere for a loan, however. When it comes to choosing who to lend to, the firm is highly selective.Genesis lends to 70 unnamed institutional counterparties whose credit is “really, really strong,” according to Moro, as loose lending policy could apparently have market-wide consequences.Moro warned that not everyone will be as strict as his firm as the lending market expands, and riskier loans will be made at higher interest rates to less creditworthy borrowers—just as banks lend to prime customers, subprime, and so on. He stated:“My one big fear is some big credit crisis that happens in crypto. A credit bubble and the bubble popping has happened in every credit market in the history of the world. And so it’ll probably be something to the effect of, either you made a bunch of unsecured loans, everyone defaults at the same time and the lender’s done, and they have no more Bitcoins to return to the people they borrowed it from, so those people are just out their Bitcoin—that’s a scary scenario.”Moro imagined a second, equally catastrophic scenario, where a steep drop in the spot price of a cryptocurrency, thinkably Bitcoin, would trigger a mass sell-off as lending firms liquidated all the loan collateral on their books.“No one’s posting more margin, and now you have to liquidate their collateral—that liquidation is going to hit the exchanges. And the margin calls are happening because prices are falling. So now you’re sending an additional 50 or 100 million-dollar market sell order on the exchanges at the same time that the prices are falling.”Moro seemed more utopian about the near future for the crypto market, saying as a “sign for the future of the ecosystem,” “we couldn’t ask for more” than Bakkt’s soon-to-launch futures contract.Bakkt: the best hedge yet?Indeed, the Bakkt futures product has been widely lauded as a game-changer for institutional participation in crypto, but many of the more nuanced benefits offered by a physically-settled BTC contract remain little-discussed.For one, Moro explained the existing cash-settled CME Group futures contract isn’t a “good hedge” in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who prefer bona fide Bitcoin to be bought and sold as a hedging mechanism. Bakkt, with its physically-settled contracts, apparently will tick this box.The practice of hedging against orders is standard practice amongst market makers like Genesis Trading (the OTC arm of Moro’s firm), allowing them to buy and sell to clients and not be affected by price fluctuations. According to Moro, this should make Bakkt a boon for liquidity in the crypto market as it encourages more regulated broker-dealers to follow in Genesis’ footsteps and market-make.Genesis: eyeing a custody solutionFor Genesis Capital to scale its efforts in the lending space, Moro said developing an in-house custody solution is much-needed.“Clients tell us all the time, can I send you some money. We’ve always been transactional, post-trade settle, so we’ve never held a balance for people. But, now that we have the lending business, custody starts to make a ton more sense,”In its current capacity Genesis Capital acts as a regulated broker, matching lenders and borrowers, and by policy won’t hold client funds. As such every time a loan request comes through, the firm has to phone up known holders of the crypto in question, receive funds from both counterparties, and make the trade happen.Custody, it seems, is the firm’s biggest bottleneck.Genesis wouldn’t necessarily be building a solution from scratch and rubbing shoulders with the likes of custody giants BitGo, Fidelity, or Coinbase Custody, however, and is open to partnering with an existing provider.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, Interview     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

231,CryptoSlate,GXChain halts operations after Chinese police raid headquarters,Ali Martinez,1568282760.0,"GXChain, one of the most highly rated blockchain projects in China, was recently raided by Chinese authorities. The price of the project’s native token GXC plummeted in response to the news.Police crack down on GXChainOn Sept. 11, the Gushu Police Department raided GXChain’s headquarter office, taking sensitive documents and computers as evidence for an ongoing investigation. The office was then sealed to prevent anyone from entering the premises. Currently, all executives of GXChain are being held for interrogation, according to Dovey Wan, founding partner at Primitive Ventures. Although Chinese authorities have not released an official statement about the case, it appears to be related to a range of business activities that are highly supervised in the country, as reported by Jinse Finance. The firm was allegedly scraping and processing sensitive information including personal credit data from its more than 2 million verified users. According to one of Jinsen Finance’s sources, the investigation was related allegedly related to data harvesting and not GXChain’s native cryptocurrency.The raid follows increasing efforts by Chinese authorities to regulate cryptocurrencies, especially in the face of proliferating scams and Ponzis. One of China’s legitimate projectsGXChain was one of China’s few legitimate projects that came out of the 2017 ICO mania. The project raised 2,451 BTC, worth $3 million at the time, through its initial offering of its GXC token.The blockchain was focused on making making decentralized applications (DApps) easier to build for developers. The company partnered with Celer Network, a second-layer scaling platform, to deploy off-chain solutions, lower fees, and increase transaction speed, which took one of its services to reach 2.4 million active users.Moreover, GXChain has been listed several times on the CCID Research Institute cryptocurrency rankings. This is an initiative put up by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to assess the top crypto projects based on basic technology, applicability, and innovation. On its latest issue, GXChain ranked number 9, while XRP and Litecoin ranked number 17 and 33, respectively.Due to GXChain’s high ranking on the CCID list, the recent move by Chinese authorities came as a surprise to many investors and the impact can be seen in GXC’s precipitous price drop.GXC price analysisGXC plummeted over 34 percent to hit a low of $0.49 after the news broke out on Sept. 11. The coin was able to recover 14 percent of its value and is now trading at around $0.56. In technical analysis, when price movements are directly related to news events, standard practice is that news has been completely factored into the price within three days. Therefore, even if the selling pressure has decreased in recent hours there may still be more legs down for the token. Based on support and resistance levels, if this cryptocurrency moves once again below $0.50 it could try to test the major support zone around $0.45. This price point marked the bottom of GXC’s most recent bear trend. If it is not able to hold, a steeper decline could follow. Otherwise, a move above $0.70 could signal that GXChain could have the potential to recover. GXC/USDT by TradingViewAs more information is released about the ongoing investigation against GXChain, price action around GXC will become clearer. In the meantime, setting up channels to get information more quickly about GXC would be a clear route to profitable trading.   GXChain 12 Sep at 11:06 am UTC$0.56  -2.83%GXChain, currently ranked #96 by market cap, is down 2.83% over the past 24 hours.

233,CryptoSlate,"Ethereum, XRP and Litecoin look bearish against BTC, but promising against USD",Ali Martinez,1567488840.0,"Despite the pessimism seen across the crypto community in regards to altcoins, the following technical analysis will evaluate whether Ethereum, XRP and Litecoin are bound for an upswing.At the moment, altcoins continue limping without any significant price movement. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is back above $10,000 and recently reached a 70 percent market dominance. Against the BTC, most of the cryptocurrencies in the space seem like they are doomed to continue depreciating in value.Peter Brandt, a renowned technical analyst, recently emphasized that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency with “real and lasting value.” After taking a look at the trading pairs ETH/BTC, XRP/BTC and LTC/BTC the 40-years trading veteran came to the conclusion that “altcoins are to Bitcoin what lead is to gold.”When will altcoin junkies understand that $BTC is the crypto with real and lasting value. Altcoins are to Bitcoin what lead is to Gold @KimDotcom pic.twitter.com/ezePnyeSxg— Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) September 2, 2019Although Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin look extremely bearish against BTC, their future looks brighter against the U.S. dollar.EthereumThe TD sequential indicator is doing an outstanding job forecasting Ethereum’s price movement since the beginning of the year, based on the 1-week chart.During the week of Feb. 4, it gave a buy signal (in the form of an aggressive thirteen) that was succeeded by a 77 percent bullish impulse that took this cryptocurrency from $102.50 to all the way up to $181.30. After the major upswing, the TD sequential presented a sell signal (in the form of a green nine) causing ETH to retrace nearly 21 percent. Finally, this technical index gave another sell signal (in the form of a green nine) during the week of July 1 that was followed by a 48.40 percent correction. Ethereum plunged from $318.30 to $164.10 in a matter of eight weeks to reach the setup trendline.Now, the TD sequential indicator is signaling that this cryptocurrency could be about to rebound. In fact, ETH is sitting on a red nine candlestick above the setup trendline, which is a buy signal based on this indicator. Thus, Ethereum could be bound for one-to-four weeks of upside movement or the beginning of a new countdown that could take it to new yearly highs.If ETH is indeed likely to rebound from the current price level, it will have to first move above the 100-three-day moving average, based on the 3-day chart. A break above this moving average has the potential to take this cryptocurrency up to test the next level of resistance around the 150-three-day moving average, $220.A move up to $220 is very likely based on the 1-day chart. As a matter of fact, a falling wedge appears to be developing under this timeframe. This is a technical formation that signals a price reversal from bearish to bullish. Upon the breakout point, the falling wedge predicts a 38 percent surge that could take ETH to surpass the resistance given by the 150-three-day moving average (based on the 3-day chart) and reach $242. A spike in the buying pressure behind this cryptocurrency will confirm all the bullish signals seen before.Nonetheless, if Ethereum is bound to continue falling it may try and test the next level of support around $145.XRPXRP continues lurching. While Bitcoin is up 230 percent from the low of December 2018, this cryptocurrency is down 7 percent. Some of the most prominent analysts in the industry are placing the blame on Ripple for the major XRP sell-off seen since 2018.In fact, Ripple revealed a substantial increase in XRP sales in its latest quarterly report. In total, the company sold $251.51 million in XRP during Q2 2019. This represents a 48 percent increase from the previous quarter where it sold $169.42 million worth of XRP.Although the firm plans to take a more conservative approach to XRP sales in Q3 2019, a popular Twitter account that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions recently reported that 1 billion XRP, worth over $258 million, were unlocked from escrow.🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 1,000,000,000 #XRP (258,488,781 USD) unlocked from escrow at Ripple Escrow walletTx: https://t.co/WG908ROBSg— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) September 1, 2019This is a clear sign that the sell-off will not stop anytime soon, as director of research at Messari Eric Turner explained:“Ripple keeps selling because it is a major source of revenue for them. I don’t expect them to stop selling any time soon. If someone gave you a printing press that spits out hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter, would you stop using it?”Even though Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse tried to address the “FUD” around XRP, it will be wiser to remain out of it due to the lack of clarity. Based on the 1-week chart, XRP could soon drop down to the next level of support that sits around $0.1975 or even lower as Peter Brandt stated if the selling pressure behind it increases.LitecoinBased on the Fibonacci retracement indicator (which is composed of horizontal lines that refer to areas of support and resistance associated with a percentage based on how much of a prior move the price has retraced) Litecoin spent over a month consolidating between the 38.2 and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement area.Following the consolidation period, LTC dropped 31 percent to reach the 65 to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement zone. Now that this cryptocurrency is trading around this area, it could likely rebound since this is considered as the ‘golden’ retracement zone.If Litecoin is indeed bound for an upswing from the current price levels, it could find some level of resistance around $85, which is where the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement zone is at. However, a break below the 65 to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement area is a strong signal of a trend reversal from bullish to bearish.The TD sequential indicator also forecasts that Litecoin could soon experience a bullish impulse. Based on the 3-day chart, this technical index is giving two different buy signal. The first one is a red nine that predicts three-to-twelve days of upside movement or the beginning of a new bullish countdown. The second one is an aggressive thirteen that adds credibility to a new uptrend.The last time the TD sequential indicator presented an aggressive thirteen under this timeframe was in Dec. 27, 2018, which was succeeded by a 421 percent upswing. An increase in the buying pressure behind this cryptocurrency could validate all the bullish signals previously mentioned taking it up to the 50 or even the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement, as seen on the 1-week chart.In addition, a bullish divergence between the relative strength index (RSI) and the price of LTC can be seen forming on the 1-day chart. Divergences occur when an oscillator such as the RSI disagrees with the actual price movement. Thus, an RSI making a series of higher lows while prices are declining is indicative of an improving trend and the probability for a trend change increases.Overall SentimentAlthough the cryptocurrencies previously analyzed look bearish against BTC, Ethereum and Litecoin could be bound for a major upswing against the U.S. dollar. A spike in volume behind these two cryptocurrencies could confirm the bullish signals seen across the different timeframes. Both ETH and LTC are signaling a 23 percent upswing that could take them to $220 and $85, respectively.On the other hand, the XRP sell-off by Ripple could be taken as a sign to remain cautious about this cryptocurrency. It is worth noting that co-founder Jed McCaleb, who is no longer at Ripple, is allegedly selling half a million XRP on a daily basis, according to Coin Metrics. Meanwhile, Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz sold 2.8 million XRP worth roughly $810,000 since the beginning of 2019. The ongoing sale of XRP could have a direct impact on the selling pressure behind this cryptocurrency depreciating its value as time goes by.Posted In: Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

234,CryptoSlate,Telegram testing an Ethereum-compatible blockchain,Priyeshu Garg,1567409700.0,"Telegram is publicly testing its much-anticipated blockchain project ‘TON.’ The company’s blockchain will be compatible with Ethereum, allowing developers to port their Ethereum smart contracts, revealed a tech startup working on the project alongside Telegram.Ethereum DApps will be available on Telegram’s new blockchain projectTelegram, one of the fastest-growing messaging apps in the world, is working on one of the most highly anticipated blockchain projects this year. The Telegram Open Network (TON), which will host the company’s native cryptocurrency Gram, is set to launch at the end of October.Notorious for its lack of transparency, Telegram has been quiet for several weeks while it was setting up the network for public testing. Last week, sources close to Telegram revealed that its blockchain will be compatible with Ethereum. The news came from TON Labs, a tech startup tasked with building several tools for the development of the Telegram network.Alexander Filatov, the CEO of TON Labs, said that one of the tools the company was working on since July was a Solidity compiler. The programming language, which is mainly used on Ethereum, will allow users to port Ethereum smart contracts to the Telegram network.“That was probably the most difficult thing we built. It will allow the advanced Ethereum community to pull everything they wrote for Ethereum into TON,” Filatov said.Public testing of the Telegram network beginsAccording to a report from Russian business paper Vedomosti, public testing of the Telegram Open Network will begin soon. The company will be releasing the code and instructions necessary for installing and hosting a Telegram node to the public.The network’s sharding and consensus mechanisms will also be available for the public to test, the Russian publication revealed, saying that it will allow users to confirm new blocks in the blockchain.Two sources close to Telegram revealed the news—Vedomosti said that one of the sources was a TON investor, while the other was the head of one of the companies that participated in TON’s closed testing phase.We are yet to see whether the public testing of TON yields any positive results for the network. The same sources said that those who participated in the closed testing round experienced various bugs and issues while installing test nodes.With less than two months left until Telegram’s deadline to launch TON, the company will be under a lot of pressure to push through the public testing. If it fails to launch a working blockchain on Oct. 31 Telegram claims it will return all of the money it raised from investors.Posted In: Ethereum, Russia, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

235,CryptoSlate,Telegram’s Gram token could go live in October (after $1.7 billion ICO),Priyeshu Garg,1567038360.0,"After months of anticipation, messaging app Telegram is inching closer to launching its Gram token. The “first batches” of the cryptocurrency are set to be delivered to investors ahead of the Oct. 31 deadline, according to a report from the New York Times.Anonymous investors reveal Telegram actively working on Gram tokensThe amount of negative press initial coin offerings (ICOs) have been getting in the past year has forced many companies to forfeit or halt work on their own digital assets. Kik is knee-deep in a bloody legal war with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the issuance of its ‘kin’ tokens and Facebook’s Libra took a massive blow from regulators. Currently, it’s fair to say that the environment is not favorable for new crypto projects.However, despite the massive hurdles it’s up against, messaging giant Telegram will reportedly be pushing ahead with its plans to release the Gram token. Announced last year, the token has previously been sold through Telegram’s two-part ICO last year, bringing in more than $1.7 billion.And now, a report from The New York Times indicated that another major listing will come sooner than expected. The report cited three anonymous investors “close to the matter” saying that the “first batches” of the Gram tokens would be delivered to investors ahead of the Oct. 31 deadline.The sources also said that the app, which is used by around 300 million people around the world, is also planning to make Gram wallets available to two-thirds of its users. With such a large user base Telegram could make Gram the go-to cryptocurrency for international payments, well ahead of Libra.Telegram’s native token still shrouded in mysteryBut, for Gram to become a go-to means of payment, it has to jump over several obstacles—one of them being stiff competition. With Facebook’s Libra also in the works, taking on the preeminent social media giant won’t be an easy task.Telegram’s lack of transparency and overall media silence will also be a tough issue to overcome. The company’s previous ICO, which raked in $1.7 billion, was only limited to accredited investors. Meanwhile, the small amounts of Gram circulating on the market didn’t get much attention from traders.A third-party sale of Gram tokens that took place in July was also shrouded in mystery. The limited offering of the token took place on cryptocurrency exchange Liquid, which listed an unspecified number of tokens held by Gram Asia, a South Korea-based organization that holds a significant number of the tokens.With its current lack of use-cases and investor skepticism, it’s hard to say if the scheduled listing will be a success. What is clear, though, is that Telegram will see the regulatory grip around Gram tighten as the October deadline approaches.Posted In: Russia, Altcoins, ICOs, Rumors     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

236,CryptoSlate,One on-chain metric could signal Chainlink’s next big price move,Ali Martinez,1566978900.0,"Josh Rager, a respected crypto trader, noticed a strong relationship between one on-chain metric and the price of Chainlink.Primer on ChainlinkSo far, Chainlink has had an amazing year. Since early December 2018, LINK went through a bull rally that took its price up nearly 26x. Along the way, Google published a guide on how to use the service with its cloud-based offering and Coinbase and Coinbase Pro listed the coin.On June 29, 2019, Chainlink peaked at $4.80. Since then, its price has retraced 59 percent. And one on-chain metric could show where it is headed next.Using exchange deposits as a leading indicatorLINK’s price action since May 2019 appears strongly correlated to exchange deposits, according to Josh Rager, co-founder of Blockroots. This metric takes into consideration the total count of transfers to exchange addresses based on on-chain data.Rager noticed that three different spikes in total transfers were closely followed by price corrections for LINK. These deposits could also be related to growing evidence that the team at Chainlink is liquidating part of their holdings.The first one occurred on May 27, when the number of transfers to exchanges hit 186 while the price of LINK was hovering around $1.33. The spike in the amount of transfers was succeeded by a 40 percent correction that took this cryptocurrency down to $0.79 on June 4.The second instance happened on June 18. As the amount of exchange deposits jumped to 132, LINK reached a high of $2.05 to then plunge nearly 24 percent over the following day.Finally, after this cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $4.80 on June 29, exchange deposits rose to 372 on July 3. The rise was followed by a 53 retracement in LINK’s market valuation.By utilizing on-chain metrics, in combination with traditional technical indicators, Josh Rager believes it is easier to evaluate possible price outcomes for a cryptocurrency. As a result, the spike in exchange deposits volume that was seen on Aug. 25, could lead to another pullback.Source: Glassnode StudioChainlink technical analysisAlthough LINK retraced 11 percent from the highest price point of Aug. 25, it continues to trade around the same price levels as it did that day. Nonetheless, the Bollinger bands for LINK appear to be squeezing on the 1-day chart.Squeezes are usually followed by periods of high volatility. The longer the squeeze the higher the probability of a strong breakout. Thus, the range between $2.03 and $2.70 seems like a reasonable no-trade zone for those looking to limit risk.A break of support or resistance could be used to confirm the direction of LINK’s next impulse. An increase in selling pressure behind this cryptocurrency could signal a drop to the next level of support, around $1.74, which will validate the ideas presented by Josh Rager. Meanwhile, an increase in buying pressure that takes Chainlink above $2.70 could allow it to surge to $3.15.LINK/USD by TradingViewOverall sentimentAccording to Josh Rager, an increasing number of exchange deposits are correlated to declining LINK prices. This metric, however, is not guaranteed. But it’s still worth paying attention to, as another influential trader, The Crypto Dog, affirmed.When looking at the 1-day chart, it seems that Chainlink has been trading within a $0.67 range for over a month. Therefore, it would be wiser to wait for LINK to break below $2.03 or above $2.70 before entering a bearish or bullish trade in order to minimize exposure to this highly volatile altcoin.

Binance announced the launch of a lending platform, offering up to 15 percent annualized interest rate for 14-day fixed-term BNB, USDT, and ETC based instruments.Crypto lending comes to BinanceBinance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, officially announced the launch of its lending platform. According to the company’s Aug. 26 blog post, the platform will launch on Aug. 29 as a value-added service aimed at Binance users who hold “idle digital assets.”The lending products will initially be available for subscription starting from 6:00 am UTC on August 28, 2019, to 12:00 am UTC on August 29, 2019, on a first-come, first-served basis. Only those with Binance “Level 2” verification or beyond are eligible to lend, meaning anonymous accounts cannot participate in the offering.#Binance Will Launch Lending Platform: 14-Day Fixed Term $USDT, $BNB and $ETC Lending Products Available for Subscriptionhttps://t.co/i3LKCvhLUq pic.twitter.com/pxsBaXZnWu— Binance (@binance) August 26, 2019Binance Lending will enable users to lend their Tether (USDT), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Binance Coin (BNB) holdings and earn interest. The company’s blog post stated that all of the lending products will have a 14-day fixed maturity term, with the interest rates for BNB, USDT, and ETC set at 15, 10, and 7 percent, respectively.Binance diversifying its offerThe exchange set a total subscription cap at 5 million USDT, 200,000 BNB, and 20,000 ETC. According to the blog post, if all of the products get fully subscribed, total interest of 19,178 USDT, 1,150 BNB, and 53 ETC would be paid out.The interest rates Binance would pay for those products would be 1,150 BNB, 19,178 USDT, and 53 ETC, it said in the blog post, all of which are currently worth around $50,000. To limit the supply, all user accounts will have a hard cap set for all of the products—1 million USDT, 500 BNB, and 1,000 ETC.Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, said that the interest rate for each product is guaranteed. “Your crypto balance will always grow, regardless of how the market moves,” he added.Yet, this raises the question as to why Binance would offer practically free money to users. Whether this is a marketing play or a profitable lending business is still unclear.The company said more Binance Lending products will be released soon once the company evaluates the demand for new coins and tokens. However, there is a possibility that the interest rates will change as new tokens are added. Binance’s blog post stated that the interest rates for all of the upcoming phases will be adjusted “based on market reception of the initial phase,” leaving the door open for an increase (or decrease) in rates.

According to the exchange website, contracts for additional coins will be added based on user demand.For market makers and takers, Digitex won’t charge for any transactions. The project plans to cover all operational costs by creating value/demand around the Digitex Futures (DGTX) token. It will do this by minting a small number of tokens each year.The exchange will launch as a centralized exchange first but will continue to work on providing users with non-custodial (decentralized) accounts. This will allow users to have 100% ownership of their funds at all times while still able to make real-time trades and lightning speed.Trading On The TestnetSmartDec, the development firm working with Digitex, is developing and vigorously testing the platform, preparing it for production. On the testnet, the firm says the exchange will be able to handle over 10,000 users trading concurrently and up to 50,000 transactions per second.A date has not been set for the Digitex platform’s mainnet launch yet, but the project team has said that testnet trading is anticipated to last for two months. After the testnet stage wraps up, Digitex plans to launch on the Ethereum mainnet. At that time, users can trade futures contracts in real-time using DGTX tokens.2019: The Year of Crypto Futures TradingAs it stands, 2019 is shaping up to be an important year for emerging futures trading platforms in crypto. The launch of Bakkt, another highly-anticipated trading platform, is scheduled for Sept. 23, 2019.

239,CryptoSlate,TomoZ goes live: a frictionless protocol for paying transaction fees in any token issued over TomoChain,Mitchell Moos,1566361800.0,"TomoChain announced it has launched TomoZ, an on-chain protocol that aims to improve how people pay transaction fees when sending tokens.The ‘Z’ in TomoZ stands for zero friction. Typically, blockchains have always made users pay transaction fees using the native blockchain’s currency, creating additional friction. Often this means that users collect dust in various wallets designed to support cryptocurrencies built on different blockchains. The goal of TomoZ is to eliminate the need for end-users to collect dust and to improve the experience of sending tokens. For example, if you send an ERC20 token from one Ethereum wallet to another, you have to hold ETH in order to pay gas fees or transaction fees. There was some discussion back in February 2018 on Reddit about a proposed change for Ethereum that would allow users to pay fees with ERC20 tokens. However, this idea hasn’t been implemented yet.Up until this point, this same transaction fee model applied to TomoChain and TRC20 tokens. With the introduction of TomoZ, however, users can now pay for transaction fees in a new token standard: TRC21. For anyone using TRC21 tokens, it’s possible to pay all on-chain fees with the token they are sending. In other words, there is no need to hold TOMO in order to send TRC21 tokens on TomoChain.🌟The #TomoZ mainnet is LIVE now!Issue your own #TRC21 token in minutes, and let token holders pay transaction fees in the token itself!⚡️TomoIssuer: https://t.co/Tfl2yttNxW⚡️How to deploy a TRC21 by #TomoWallet: https://t.co/9VNbyQwghC pic.twitter.com/HzRN3UJdS5— TomoChain (@TomoChainANN) August 20, 2019TRC21 Token Creation and IssuanceAlthough end-users don’t necessarily need to hold TOMO, TomoZ is structured so that it requires the TRC21 token issuer to pay TOMO to cover fees required by TomoChain’s masternodes. This is done through a TomoIssuer contract. Another goal of TomoZ is to simplify the process of token creation and issuance. TomoZ provides a dashboard for any token issuer who wants to issue a TRC21 token on TomoChain. To issue a token, only a few basic parameters (token supply, token name and minimum transaction fee) need to be configured.No coding experience is required to launch a new token. The project team has uploaded a tutorial video showing how it’s possible to create and issue a TRC21 token on TomoChain’s testnet.TomoZ also takes into account the possibility that TRC21 token issuers might not have paid a sufficient amount of TOMO to cover all end-user transaction fees. In this scenario, an end-user would have to revert back to the old transaction fee payment method by depositing more TOMO to the TomoIssuer contract to cover the costs of on-chain operations. Long Vuong, CEO and founder of TomoChain states,“Ease of use is one of the obstacles that is holding blockchain technology back from mass adoption. TomoChain’s recently launched TomoZ protocol is an attempt to solve that problem, by creating a frictionless experience for average users.”Posted In: Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

240,CryptoSlate,SEC charges ICO Rating for shilling crypto projects without disclosure,Mitchell Moos,1566274380.0,"The SEC penalized Russia-based ICO Rating for failing to disclose it was being paid to shill cryptocurrency projects. The enforcement action comes as the Commission continues to crack down on firms that tout crypto securities without disclosures.ICO Rating is one of several mostly Russian-run crypto rating agencies, behind ICOBench and ICOmarks. The firm advertises itself as an “independent” rating and research service on a mission to “help the market achieve the necessary standards of quality, transparency, and reliability.”However, it seems ICO Rating failed to adhere to its own mission statement. The SEC found that the agency covertly accepted payments to shill cryptocurrency securities that were supposedly being evaluated ‘independently.’ICO Rating violated the anti-touting provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 because it “failed to disclose that it was paid by certain issuers whose ICO offerings it rated,” said the Commission.ICO Rating agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgement interest of 107,000 and civil penalties of $162,000, without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, for a total of $269,000.“The securities laws require promoters, including both people and entities, to disclose compensation they receive for touting investments so that potential investors are aware they are viewing a paid promotional item,” said Melissa Hodgman, associate director of the Commission’s enforcement division.This is certainly not the first (or last) time crypto-related businesses were found promoting coins without disclosure. In October 2018, BreakerMag found that half of crypto news outlets would, for a fee, publish an advertisement without disclosing they were being paid—including larger publications such as Bitcoinist and NewsBTC.Celebrities have also been found to endorse crypto-based securities without disclosure. Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled were penalized by the SEC for accepting payments to shill crypto projects without informing people of receiving payment. John McAfee is notorious for similar behavior.Hopefully, as the Securities Exchange Commission cleans up the crypto-sphere people can be more confident in the information they read.

241,CryptoSlate,Binance Coin and Chainlink at pivotal trading points while TRON remains bearish,Ali Martinez,1566266100.0,"The recent market upswing took many investors into the bullish side once again. Even though the surge was seen across the entire industry, most altcoins lost the value they gained yesterday. This technical analysis will evaluate whether Binance Coin, TRON, or Chainlink have a chance to continue rising.Binance CoinBinance was in the spotlight after its CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that the dedicated U.S. division of the cryptocurrency exchange will go live by November. He also recently revealed that the Binance is planning to launch Venus, an open blockchain project focused on developing localized stablecoins around the world to compete with Facebook’s Libra.After gaining approximately 4.50 percent, Binance Coin lost almost all that value yesterday. As a result, a bearish engulfing pattern is forming on the 1-day chart. This is a technical chart pattern that signals a downward impulse.At the moment, BNB seems to be held by support provided at the 150-day moving average. If the bearish engulfing pattern is validated, a break below the moving average is expected. Falling below the 150-day moving average could take Binance Coin to test the support given by the 200-day moving average, currently at $24.It is worth noting that since mid-July BNB mostly traded between the 150-day moving average and the 100-day moving average. Thus, a candlestick close or open below the recent low of $26.75 could be used as confirmation that the 150-day moving average will break. However, if the 150-day moving average continues containing the price of BNB, then a rebound to the 100-day moving average seems more likely.TRONDespite the relentless marketing from CEO Justin Sun and his efforts to take TRX back into the top 10 by market cap the price of this cryptocurrency continues declining. It seems like investors have not been able to forget the claims made by different Chinese media outlets after Sun abruptly canceled his lunch with Warren Buffet. As a matter of fact, TRON plummeted nearly 47 percent since then and has been unable to recover from these losses.Based on the 3-day chart, the buy signal given by the TD sequential indicator on July 24 was invalidated as the selling pressure behind this cryptocurrency increased. Now, a new bullish signal is given by this technical index in the form of a red nine, predicting a three-to-twelve days upswing or the beginning of a new upward countdown. Due to the low volume and the sentiment behind TRX, it will be wiser to wait for a green two candlestick to trade above a preceding green one candlestick, which will serve as confirmation of the bullish signal.Conversely, the buy signal given by the TD sequential indicator will be invalidated if a red two candlestick trades below a preceding red one candlestick.By measuring the Fibonacci retracement indicator from the low of $0.0111 on Nov. 25, 2018, to the high of $0.0408 on June 2, it appears that TRON is currently trading around the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement zone. As a result, TRON’s trend can be considered bearish due to the slope of the correction that began after TRX peaked at $0.0408.If TRON is going to rebound per the TD sequential indicator, the 65 to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement zone could act as strong resistance. However, a break below the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement area could take this cryptocurrency down to around $0.0111.ChainlinkJune was a great month for Chainlink. During this time, Google announced that it was integrating LINK into its cloud-based services and Coinbase Pro as well as Coinbase listed it for trading. The result was a nearly 340 percent upswing in a matter of sixteen days that took this cryptocurrency from $1.11 to an all-time high of $4.80 on June 29.Since then, Chainlink corrected 60 percent and recently entered a consolidation phase. From mid-July until now, this cryptocurrency is trading between $2.09 and $2.70. Consequently, the Bollinger bands on the 1-day chart appear to be squeezing. Squeezes are usually followed by periods of high volatility. The longer the squeeze the higher the probability of a strong breakout. Thus, the range between $2.09 and $2.70 seems like a reasonable no-trade zone.Although Chainlink is in a no-trade zone, a symmetrical triangle seems to be developing on the 12-hour chart. This technical formation represents a period of consolidation before the price is forced to break out in a negative or positive trend. A move below the lower trendline marks the start of a new bearish trend. Meanwhile, a move above the upper trendline indicates the start of a new bullish trend. By measuring the distance between the initial high and low, the symmetrical triangle predicts a 28 percent target on both directions.Based on the no-trade zone seen on the 1-day chart, the support and resistance levels could be used to confirm the direction in which the symmetrical triangle will resolve. Therefore, a spike in selling pressure that takes LINK below $2.09 could signal that this cryptocurrency will decline further to reach $1.74. On the other hand, an increase in buying pressure that takes Chainlink above $2.70 could allow it to surge to $3.15.Overall SentimentThe entire cryptocurrency market entered a major corrective phase that has taken many coins to make lower lows. As Bitcoin continues signaling a move back above $11,000, altcoins appear to have more legs to go down.At the moment, Binance Coin is sitting at a pivotal point where it could continue trading between the 100 and 150-day moving average or drop to a new low. Along the same lines, Chainlink could soon move 28 percent in any direction if the symmetrical triangle seen on the 12-hour chart is validated. Finally, TRON remains bearish despite Justin Sun’s attempts to bring it back into the top 10.Posted In: Tron, Binance, Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

243,CryptoSlate,A quick rundown of how the cryptocurrency market has performed so far in 2019,eToro,1566009480.0,"The second half of 2019 is now upon us. As we all know, 2018 was a terrible year for cryptocurrencies as the market slumped and lost much of its 2017 gains. The market sentiment at the start of this year was evenly divided between cautious optimism and fearful pessimism. However, cryptocurrencies have managed to climb several bullish waves despite the slow start to the year.The chart above shows the performance of cryptocurrencies relative to traditional Wall Street equities as represented in the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite. The BTC/USD has gained 240 percent in the year-to-date period while the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S&P 500 have only gained 23.65 percent and 18.86 percent respectively in the same period.In response to the outperformance of cryptocurrencies, some trading platforms such as eToro are now allowing traders to actively build crypto-based portfolios in order to access opportunities in emerging asset classes. This article will provide more insight into the performance of the cryptocurrency market as we prepare to head into the second half of the year.JanuaryCryptocurrencies started 2019 in a depressed state following the general bearish downturn of 2018.  Bitcoin started for the year around $3717.60 and other altcoins were also in a depressed state. However, the euphoria of starting a New Year triggered a 9 percent bullish run in Bitcoin to end the first week at trading around $4,031.09.A 9 percent rally at the start of the year is tepid by historical cryptocurrency standards; hence it wasn’t surprising the cryptocurrency market ended January with losses. The market cap of the cryptocurrency market declined more than 8 percent in January from around $125B to $115B.FebruaryBitcoin’s trading price dropped to its year-to-date low of $3358.83 on February 7 but the market seems to have gotten on a slow but measured uptrend since then. Interestingly, February has always been historically bullish for cryptocurrencies. From 2015, Bitcoin has always ended February with impressive gains and it continued the trend of the fifth straight year in 2019. Bitcoin ended February with a modest 11 percent gain while the market cap of the entire cryptocurrency industry was up 12 percent.MarchMarch brought some good news that could potentially hasten the mass-market adoption of cryptocurrencies. In March, Binance introduced Binance Lite, which allows people to purchase Bitcoin with cash in more than 1300 locations in Australia.  Starbucks also announced that its patrons can now pay for their coffee with cryptocurrencies through the Bakkt platform.However, surprisingly, Bitcoin only managed to gain 6.28 percent at the end of March; in contrast, the market cap of the altcoins grew by 14 percent from $57.28B to $65.25B at the end of March 2019. March was a good month for altcoins and the dominance of Bitcoin dropped from 52.06 percent on March 1 to 50.22 percent by March 31st.AprilThe 2019 bullish trend for cryptocurrencies became firmly entrenched in April with the market gaining 16.5 percent to add a massive $24B to its total market capitalization. Bitcoin was at the forefront of the rally after breaking a long-term resistance to cross the $5000 mark. Bitcoin closed for April at $5,333.April was a wonderful month for altcoins. Bitcoin Cash was one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies as it soared more than 51 percent from $168 on April 1 to $255 on April 30 – it touched a $317 high in mid-April.  XRP, however, had a poor showing in April after losing the 17 percent it gained during a rally to end the month with a marginal decline.MayMay was the best month for cryptocurrencies so far in 2019. The total market capitalization of the industry jumped by more than 50 percent after Bitcoin recorded an unhindered rally to cross $9000. In fact, the market cap of the entire crypto industry soared to a 10-month high of $285B before it pulled back slightly.Ethereum managed to score a place in the list of top gainers as it rallied by more than 60 percent to close the month at $260. Bitcoin Cash also scored a 60 percent gain, Litecoin was up 48 percent, and XRP clawed its way back up with a 37 percent gain.June and going forward into Q3 2019The cryptocurrency market is trying to consolidate and right now it is uncertain if the market will break out into previous highs or breakdown below the resistance. Many retail traders are also being extra cautious of market momentum that seems to be largely driven by the action of Bitcoin whales. Earlier in June, a whale moved 25,000BTC from an offline wallet to a Coinbase wallet to pull off a $200M trade that triggered a panic selloff.However, the market is back to “stable” mode and traders are watching the technical indicators for where the market could be headed next. Nonetheless, the news that Facebook will soon be launching a cryptocurrency is already brewing up some undercurrents and it would be interesting to see how the market reacts when more details emerge about how the coin will be used to power developing economies.Discover the Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in Today  Start trading on eToro  Disclosure: CryptoSlate will earn a small commission when you sign up.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

244,CryptoSlate,"What’s next for Ethereum, XRP and Litecoin after the recent plunge ?",Ali Martinez,1565941440.0,"Bitcoin is in the spotlight once again after Bakkt was granted the first approval from the CFTC for physically-settled Bitcoin futures. As the pioneer cryptocurrency takes the attention from the market, most of the altcoins have been left behind even plummeting to new yearly lows. The following technical analysis will explore how Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin could perform in the short term future now that they have recently taken a nosedive.EthereumEthereum retracted more than 50 percent over the last few weeks to reach a low of $174, for the first time since mid-May. The correction comes after ETH peaked at $366 on June 26. This is the steepest pullback that Ethereum has had since the bull run started in December 15, 2018. As a matter of fact, throughout the year every time this cryptocurrency reached a new yearly high, it retraced 28.40 percent on average.By measuring the Fibonacci retracement indicator from the low of $80.70 on December 15 to the high of $366 on June 26, it appears that Ethereum retraced to the 61.8 to 65 percent Fibonacci retracement zone. This Fibonacci retracement area is considered by many traders as the ‘golden’ retracement zone due to the high probability of a rebound.If Ethereum is indeed likely to rebound from the current price level, it could find resistance on its way up around the 50 and 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels, which are sitting at $223 and $256, respectively. However, a break below the 65 percent Fibonacci retracement level could take it down to $143, where the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level sits at.Based on the 1-day chart, Ethereum recently broke out of an ascending triangle. As a result, this cryptocurrency went down to $174 to reach the target given by the bearish formation. Now that the ascending triangle can be considered complete, the TD sequential indicator is giving two different buy signals.The first one is an aggressive thirteen that formed on August 15. The second one is a red nine candlestick that predicts a one-to-four day upswing or the beginning of a new upward countdown. These bullish signals align with the potential rebound that the Fibonacci retracement indicator presents on the 3-day chart. Therefore, there is a high probability for a rebound that could take Ethereum to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level.XRPAfter going through a consolidation period that lasted more than a month, XRP broke below the $0.30 support level for the first time since October 2018. The result was a 21 percent plunge that took this cryptocurrency to reach a new yearly low of $0.24. This price level represents a pivotal point for XRP’s trend, according to 40-year trading veteran Peter Brandt.The author of Diary of a Professional Commodity Trader believes that if the $0.24 support level is not able to hold the price of XRP, then this cryptocurrency could be bound for a major drop that takes its market valuation to around $0.021, representing a 90 percent retracement from current levels.Will Ripple be able to manipulate the market to keep $XRP above .2400? A serious breakdown at this level, and .020725 is in the cards. pic.twitter.com/QAyfMcwaZd— Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) August 14, 2019Fundamentally, such a steep decline could occur if the complaint filed against Ripple—arguing that the startup illegally sold unregistered securities—is pursued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If the motion is taken into consideration by the regulatory agency, XRP’s market valuation could suffer severe consequences. The recent legal actions taken by the SEC against Veritaseum, which took its price down more than 60 percent within a few hours, could be taken as an example of the impact that such news could pose for XRP.In the meantime, while the SEC responds to the recent complaint filed against Ripple it will be wiser to remain out of XRP. Based on the 1-week chart, this cryptocurrency could soon drop down to the next level of support that sits around $0.19 if the selling pressure behind it increases.LitecoinBased on the Fibonacci retracement indicator (which is composed of horizontal lines that refer to areas of support and resistance associated with a percentage based on how much of a prior move the price has retraced) Litecoin spent over a month consolidating between the 38.2 and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement area.Since the consolidation phase took place after a 48 percent pullback that took this cryptocurrency from $147 to $76, a bear pennant developed on the 3-day chart. This is considered a continuation pattern that leads to a breakout in the same direction as the initial movement. As a result, this bearish formation forecasts a 25 percent drop to around $66, which is taken by measuring the height of the flagpole.So far, Litecoin dropped 22 percent to reach the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement zone, which can be taken as a completion of the bear pennant. Now that LTC is trading around the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level, it could be bound to rebound since this area is considered as the ‘golden’ retracement zone.If Litecoin indeed rebounds from the current price levels, it could find some level of resistance around $85, which is where the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement zone is at. However, a break below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level is a strong signal of a trend reversal from bullish to bearish.The 12-hour chart indicates that the ‘golden’ retracement zone will indeed allow LTC to rebound. Under this time frame, a bullish divergence between the relative strength index (RSI) and the price of LTC can be seen forming.Divergences occur when an oscillator such as the RSI disagrees with the actual price movement. Thus, an RSI making a series of higher lows while prices are declining is indicative of an improving trend and the probability for a trend change increases.In addition, the TD sequential indicator could soon give a buy signal in the form of a red nine. If validated, this bullish signal forecasts a twelve to forty-eight hours upswing or the beginning of a new upward countdown. An increase in the buying pressure behind this cryptocurrency could validate all the bullish signals previously mentioned taking it up to the 50 or even the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement, as seen on the 3-day chart.Overall SentimentDespite the recent correction seen across the entire cryptocurrency market, it seems that Ethereum and Litecoin could soon resume their bullish trend. As a matter of fact, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI) hit its highest levels of pessimism since December 2018, which is a strong bullish sign.The last time this technical index reached the “extremely fear” level was in mid-December 2018 and was succeeded by a 35 percent upswing in the market cap on the entire cryptocurrency market. Although the GFGI only analyses the daily emotions and sentiments around Bitcoin, it serves to determine the direction of the industry as a whole.On the other hand, due to the regulatory uncertainty that surrounds XRP investors should remain cautious on whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will classify this cryptocurrency as an unregistered security or not. Until then, it will be wiser to stay out of it.Posted In: Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

245,CryptoSlate,"Bitcoin drags Monero, Tezos, and Basic Attention Token into large losses",Ali Martinez,1565746440.0,"Bitcoin is again leading the market. As BTC’s price started to decline the rest of the market slid, but three coins stood out with major losses. The following technical analysis will evaluate Monero, Tezos, and Basic Attention Token.BitcoinAfter the recent drop below $11,000 Bitcoin may continue its decline. The support given by the 100-twelve hour moving average, around $10,900, was violated (as seen on the 12-hour chart below). As a result, BTC could be expected to reach the 150-twelve hour moving average. This moving average currently sits around the middle line of the descending parallel channel where Bitcoin has been trading since June 26.Therefore, the support cluster around the area previously mentioned could be strong enough to contain the price action of Bitcoin from a further decline. If it does indeed hold, then the cryptocurrency could rebound back to the 100-twelve hour moving average or the top of the descending parallel channel pictured below.Nonetheless, a break below the 150-twelve hour moving average will signal a plunge to the 200-twelve hour moving average or the bottom of the descending parallel channel.MoneroThe TD sequential indicator was able to predict the last two major price movements on Monero’s trend, as seen on the 1-day chart. On July 30, the technical indicator gave a buy signal in the form of a red nine that resulted in a 26 percent upswing, taking XMR from $77.64 to nearly $98.At its peak, the TD sequential indicator signaled a correction as the Aug. 8 candlestick turned into a green nine. Combined with a hanging man candlestick, the indicators affirmed the ongoing correction that took Monero down 15 percent from its recent high.Now that this cryptocurrency broke below the support given by the 100-day moving average, the next barrier that could contain it from a further drop is the 150-day moving average sitting around $82. If this moving average fails to hold the price of Monero the next level of support sits around $74 where the 200-day moving average is currently trading at.Even though the moving averages suggest that Monero could continue declining to around $82, the Adam and Eve double bottom pattern that formed on the 12-hour chart indicates otherwise.The Adam and Eve double bottom pattern is considered a bullish reversal formation. The formation occurred after the price of XMR dropped on July 17 to $72 to form a V-shaped valley, then rising all the way up to $88 on July 21, and then pulled back again to form the wider and more rounded valley near the price of the first one from July 24 to Aug. 2, completing the pattern.As the buying pressure increased, XMR broke above the middle peak of the Adam and Eve double bottom pattern, signaling that it was targeting $98. So far, Monero has gone up to $98 reaching the target given by the bullish reversal formation. Now, that it pulled back to the breakout zone between $84 and $87, the bullish trend can be expected to resume.Due to the opposite views that the 1-day chart and the 12-hour chart present, it is preferable to wait for additional confirmation before entering a trade.Thus, a break below the 150-day moving average on the 1-day chart could be taken as a signal that XMR is poised for a further drop. Meanwhile, a move above the 100-day moving average could hint at a continuation of the uptrend.TezosTezos has had a great summer so far, surging nearly 100 percent over the last month after its team closed a multi-million dollar deal and the coin was listed on Coinbase Pro. As XTZ rose to $1.64 on Aug. 6, it hit an exhaustion point where investors took profits, allowing the coin to further correct.Based on the Fibonacci retracement indicator, a mathematical method used to identify different price levels that could act as support, Tezos’ 100 percent rise came after it hit the 61.8 percent retracement level. The 61.8 level is considered the ‘golden’ retracement zone by many traders due to the higher probability of a rebound.Indeed, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level was able to catapult XTZ’s price from $0.83 to $1.64, where the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement zone sits.Now that Tezos rose to the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement zone, it recently pulled back to the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level. Although this Fibonacci retracement level acted as support and resistance several times in the past, it seems like XTZ could be moving below these levels at the moment. Breaking below the current support cluster could take Tezos down to test the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level, which is sitting around $1.09.As a matter of fact, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), which is commonly used to follow the path of a trend and calculate its momentum, recently had a bearish cross on the 1-day chart. Over three days ago the 12-month exponential moving average moved below the 26-month exponential moving average, signaling a further decline. The last time such a bearish formation occurred on the 1-day chart was on July 13, causing Tezos to retrace nearly 25 percent from $1.10 to $0.83.Despite the bearishness seen on both the 3-day chart as well as the 1-day chart, it is worth considering the probability of a rebound that could take this cryptocurrency to higher highs. Due to the high volatility that Tezos experienced over the last month, a move above the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level or the recent high of $1.64 could signal the continuation of the bullish trend.Basic Attention TokenFollowing its high of $0.503 on April 21, Basic Attention Token entered a bearish trend that has taken its price down to $0.187, representing a 63 percent plunge. Based on the 1-day chart, BAT appears to be trading inside a descending parallel channel since its downward price action has been contained inside two parallel lines. At the moment, this cryptocurrency is near the bottom of the channel signaling that a potential rebound to the middle or the top of the channel could occur.In addition, a bullish divergence between the relative strength index (RSI) and the price of BAT can be seen under the same timeframe. Divergences occur when an oscillator such as the RSI disagrees with the actual price movement. Thus, an RSI making a series of higher lows while prices are declining is indicative of an improving trend and the probability for a trend change increase. Based on both the descending parallel channel and the bullish divergence seen under the 1-day chart, Basic Attention Token could be due for a rebound.It is worth noting that a break below the descending parallel channel could signal a deeper correction than the one seen so far.Overall SentimentBitcoin continues leading the rest of the market. Although Basic Attention Token is on a bearish trend since April—over the last month BAT, XMR, and XTZ seem to be closely tethered to Bitcoin’s price action.Now that the pioneer cryptocurrency is pulling back from the recent upswing the other cryptocurrencies appear to be following. At the moment, different technical indicators differ on whether a bullish impulse or a continuation of the retracement will materialize. Thus, sitting on the sidelines and waiting for clear movement currently seems like the safest choice.Posted In: Basic Attention Token, Bitcoin, Monero, Tezos, Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

246,CryptoSlate,How Bitcoin dominance could retrace and trigger an altcoin bull market,Ali Martinez,1565686560.0,"In 2019, Bitcoin decoupled from the rest of the crypto market, with its dominance rising to 70 percent for the first time since December 2017. Will the trend continue, or will the pioneer cryptocurrency reach an exhaustion point that triggers a renewed “altseason?”Market dominanceBitcoin’s rise to dominate began in December of 2018. Since then, BTC gained 327 percent from a low to $3,200 to a high of nearly $14,000. Meanwhile, most altcoins are sideways or down relative to Bitcoin.According to some pundits, Bitcoin dominance will supposedly reach 80 percent while altcoins’ role in the market fades, as stated by Max Keiser, host of RT’s Keiser Report. As a result, the former Wall Street trader believes investors should sell their altcoins for BTC.#Bitcoin dominance 68.2% – heading to 80% – as alts die in favor of BTC. The 2014-2017 era of alts and hard forks is dead. Don’t be the last to rotate out of alts into BTC.— Max Keiser, tweet poet. (@maxkeiser) August 6, 2019Looking at the 1-week Bitcoin dominance chart, it seems Keiser’s advice could be sound. An ascending triangle began forming under the 1-week timeframe at the trough of the correction in 2017 (at the time, BTC’s dominance was at a historic low of 35 percent).Even more bullish, Bitcoin broke out to the upside of the ascending triangle and could be targeting a 38.7 percent upswing that takes it up to 80 percent market dominance, similar to what Max Keiser forecasted.That said, the TD sequential indicator is giving a bearish signal in the form of a green nine. This technical index predicts a one-to-four weeks correction. Based on this bearish signal, BTC’s dominance could drop significantly, allowing altcoins to gain as capital flows out Bitcoin. Nonetheless, a green two candlestick trading above a preceding green one candle could invalidate the bearish signal given by the TD sequential indicator, allowing the uptrend to continue.It’s worth noting that since late 2017, the last four times the TD sequential indicator gave a sell signal (in the form of a green nine) three were correct.The first happened the week of Nov. 6, 2017, which resulted in a 25 percent plunge from a market share of 65.6 to 48.5 percent. The second sell signal occurred the week of Mar. 26, 2018, taking dominance from 50.2 to 38.7 percent. The last retracement was the one in the week of Sept. 17, 2018, which dropped BTC’s market share from 58.8 to 51.3 percent.Source: Trading View Bitcoin DominanceAlthough Bitcoin’s dominance is currently in a bearish posture, altcoin dominance is sitting in the “golden” retracement area based on the Fibonacci retracement indicator.Following the correction that began in January 2018, altcoins’ dominance over the market recently reached the 61.8 and 65 percent Fibonacci retracement level. This Fibonacci retracement zone represents a pivotal point for the altcoins’ dominance trend. A significant correction, like the one just experienced in this area, suggests that a rebound could be underway.If validated, the rebound could have the potential to take the altcoins’ dominance up to the 50 or 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level. However, a break below the golden retracement level is a signal of a trend reversal from bullish to bearish, which could lead to a major drop in altcoins’ market valuation.Source: CoinTraderPrice AnalysisBitcoin developed an Adam and Eve double bottom pattern on its 12-hour chart, which was validated the moment it moved above $10,800. The pattern is considered a bullish reversal formation, occurring after the price of Bitcoin dropped on July 17 to $9,070 (forming the V-shaped valley). Then, the price rose to $11,100 on July 20, then pulled back again to form a wide, more rounded valley near the price of the first one from July 23 to Aug. 2.As buying pressure increased, BTC broke above the middle peak of the Adam and Eve double bottom pattern signaling that it was targeting $12,500. On Aug. 6, Bitcoin went up to $12,330, which is very close to the target given by the bullish reversal formation. Thus, the Adam and Eve double bottom pattern can be considered complete. Upon its completion, this pattern predicts a pullback to the breakout point, $10,800, which could happen at any moment since the cryptocurrency recently hit a low of $11,100.Source: Trading View BTC/USDIn the meantime, the top four altcoins—Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin—seem to have entered a consolidation phase since July 15, 2019. On the 12-hour chart of these altcoins, the Bollinger bands appear to be squeezing, which indicates that they are indeed consolidating. Squeezes are followed by periods of high volatility. The longer the squeeze the higher the probability of a strong breakout.If Bitcoin is bound to retrace to $10,800 support, the altcoins could enjoy a price increase, which will align with what can be seen in the dominance charts. Nonetheless, the top four altcoins appear to be in a “no-trade” zone and a break below support or above the resistance could help determine the reality of the next “altseason.”For the last month, Ethereum has been trading between $199 and $235. While it remains in this range trading risk is heightened. A move with a spine in volume below $199 or above $235While ETH remains trading in this range, any trade poses an extreme level of risk. A move with a spike in volume below $199 or above $235 will lift the no-trade zone.Source: Trading View XRP/USDAlong the same lines, XRP is stuck between $0.30 to $0.33 without any major price action. Breaking below $0.30 could take it down to $0.24, or lower, while a move above $0.33 could take XRP to $0.38 or higher.Bitcoin Cash, however, can be seen making higher highs and higher lows since July 15. But, this is only with low trading volume and low volatility. Thus, it will be wiser to wait for a break of the support or resistance level before betting on the direction of the coin.Source: Trading View BCH/USDFinally, Litecoin’s price action over the last month has been characterized by a $20 rise and fall between $83 and $103. An increase in volume could allow LTC to trade outside of this range, allowing to clarify whether it is bound to go up or down.Source: Trading View LTC/USDOverall sentimentEven though Bitcoin’s weekly dominance chart is sitting in a bearish posture based on the TD sequential indicator, it is still too early to tell if this bearish signal will have the potential to trigger the next “altseason.” As can be seen in the 12-hour chart of the four altcoins, they have all entered a consolidation phase without any clear signs of which direction they will break out in.Therefore, under the current market conditions, waiting for confirmation on Bitcoin’s bearish dominance signals combined with indicators from Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin is preferable. With the right confluence of factors, another altseason seems possible.Nevertheless, if ETH, XRP, BCH, and LTC move below support and BTC continues inching up in dominance, then BTC dominance may reach a staggering 80 percent, as Mike Keiser predicted.

Even though the exchange has been adding a variety of new cryptocurrencies over the last few years, the vast majority of the trading activity is concentrated in Bitcoin.As a matter of fact, Bitcoin accounts for 75.1 percent of the total trading volume on the San Francisco-based exchange. Meanwhile, the other most traded cryptocurrencies on Coinbase Pro are Ethereum with 8.8 percent trading volume, Litecoin with 7.5 percent, and XRP and Bitcoin Cash with 2.4 percent each.The rest of the cryptocurrencies that are available on the platform including Chainlink, Stellar, EOS, Dai, Ethereum Classic, 0x, Basic Attention Token, Augur, Zcash, Decentraland, Golem, Loom Network, district0x and Civic, combined, had a trading volume of less than $18 million over the last 24 hours, only representing 3.9 percent of the activity on the exchange.As Coinbase continues to add new cryptocurrencies, it does not seem to be benefiting from them. MANA, GNT, LOOM, DNT, and CVC each had a trading volume lower than $20,000 over the last 24-hours—meaning they hardly impact the company’s revenue. Instead, the firm could actually be exposing itself to U.S. regulatory scrutiny and other legal risks.Over the last few years Coinbase has been criticized for slowing down the adoption of Bitcoin. After SegWit was integrated into BTC via soft fork on August 2017, to allow more transactions to fit in a single block, the firm took more than seven months to enable SegWit transactions on the platform. Now the cryptocurrency exchange has been working on batching transactions for more than a year since its CEO Brian Armstrong first talked about it.Even today, Coinbase continues to promote and add altcoins rather than provide full support for Bitcoin, argued Jameson Lopp and other BTC supporters in the community. In addition to allegations of user surveillance, customer support deficiencies, and other issues, user outrage culminated in the “Delete Coinbase” movement earlier this year.Posted In: Bitcoin, Coinbase, U.S., Altcoins, Analysis, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

249,CryptoSlate,"Bitcoin fork technical analysis: Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, and Bitcoin Gold",Ali Martinez,1564451940.0,"Over the last week, Bitcoin’s trading volume has been fading away. On July 15, it surpassed $25 billion, but over the past few weeks, it dropped to around $14 billion today. As BTC’s volume continues declining, its price seems to have gotten stuck in a $600 trading range between $9,900 and $9,300 without any clear signs of a breakout.A similar pattern can be seen throughout the entire crypto industry, leading investors to believe that the market has entered a consolidation phase. Despite the uncertainty in the market, this technical analysis will try to determine what the future holds for some of the top Bitcoin hard forks, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, and Bitcoin Gold.Bitcoin CashAfter reaching a yearly high of $518 on June 22, Bitcoin Cash retraced over 50 percent, dropping to $255 on July 15. Now, BCH has spent the last week trading between the 38.2 and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement zone without any major outbreak.BCH price action could have been reduced over the last few days due to the uncertainty that can be perceived across the industry. Nonetheless, the Fibonacci retracement indicator could help identify the different price points that will act as barriers preventing a push in any direction if volatility hits the market once again.To the upside, if volume starts picking up and Bitcoin Cash is able to break above the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, it could try to test the resistance given by the 23.6 and 18.16 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. On the other hand, if the selling pressure increases BCH could plunge another 22 percent to reach the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level that sits around $242.When looking at the 1-day chart, it seems like the bearish scenario is more likely to happen than the bullish one–a bear pennant appears to be developing under this timeframe predicting a further retracement.This is considered a continuation pattern that was formed after the significant correction that took BCH from $430 to $270, known as the flagpole, which was followed by the current consolidation period, known as the pennant, and could lead to a breakout in the same direction as the initial movement. As a result, this bearish formation forecasts a 32 percent drop to around $200, which is taken by measuring the height of the flagpole.However, before taking a stance on the direction in which Bitcoin Cash will breakout, it will be worth taking a look at the 4-hour chart. Under this time frame, it can be seen how the Bollinger bands are squeezing, which indicates BCH has entered a consolidation phase. Squeezes are typically followed by periods of high volatility.Thus, a break above $326 could lead to an upswing to the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level that invalidates the bear pennant seen in the 1-day chart. Meanwhile, a break below $289 could confirm the bearish formation taking this cryptocurrency down the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level or lower.Bitcoin SVAt the beginning of July, Bitcoin SV plummeted 48 percent following the breach of the support given by the 50-day moving average since mid-May. As the plunge unraveled, the 150-day moving average was able to contain the price of BSV from a further decline and allowed it to rebound to the 50-day moving average. Recently, this cryptocurrency has gone back down to the 100-day moving average where it has been trading over the last 3 days.If the 100-day moving average is able to hold, then BSV could go up to test the resistance given by the 50-day moving average. Conversely, a break of the 100-day moving average could take this cryptocurrency down to the 150-day moving average once again.Based on the 12-hour chart, it seems like Bitcoin SV could actually test the 50-day moving average since a bull flag appears to be developing. This is considered a continuation pattern that was formed after the upswing that took BSV from $108.5 to $188.7, known as the flagpole, which was followed by the current consolidation period, known as the flag, and could lead to a breakout in the same direction as the initial movement. The bull flag oversees a 41 percent surge to around $200, which is exactly where the 50-day moving average is trading at.Bitcoin GoldOn the 3-day chart, after failing to break above the $31.5 resistance level Bitcoin Gold has dropped down to the $18 support level. This is an important level for BTG since in the past it has been able to prevent its price from being pushed down on multiple occasions.Based on historical data, the $18 support level will likely hold and serve as a rebound point taking the price of Bitcoin Gold to test the different levels of resistance ahead, such as the $21.8 and $25.8. However, a break below this support cluster could cause a further correction to $15.5 or $12.3.The TD Sequential Indicator on the 1-day and 12-hrs adds credibility to the idea that the $18 support level will hold. Based on this technical index, a buy signal has been given under both time frames in the form of a red nine, which predicts a 1 to a 4-day upswing. If the bullish signal is validated by a green two candlestick trading above a green one, then BTG could go up to the setup trendline that sits around $27.It is worth noting that the buy signals given by TD Sequential Indicator will be invalidated if there is a red two candlestick trading below a red one. Under this condition, BTG will have the potential to break below the $18 support level and test the support levels previously discussed.Overall SentimentAfter the major correction that has impacted most of the crypto market, some of the Bitcoin forks are showing signs of an upcoming rise. Even though Bitcoin Cash is forming a bear pennant that is targeting a 34 percent decline, a move above $326 could change the bearish outlook and take it back into the bullish side.Meanwhile, different technical patterns in Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Gold appear to be signaling that they will potentially resume their upward trend soon. It remains to be seen whether these cryptos are able to break above their respective resistance levels with enough volume to propoel them to the bullish targets presented in this technical analysis.Posted In: Bitcoin Cash, Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

250,CryptoSlate,"Mining pool CEO: Craig Wright is a “chess piece” for Bitcoin SV, Calvin Ayre allegedly calls the shots",Omar Faridi,1564358940.0,"Jiang Zhuoer, the CEO at BTC.TOP, one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools, revealed that Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre planned the split from the Bitcoin Cash network long before the matter was publicly discussed.In a Reddit post that shares part of an interview with Zhuoer, the Chinese entrepreneur pointed out that Craig Wright only “seems” to be the leader of the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) community. He claims that the self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor is only “a chess piece,” and that online-gambling billionaire Calvin Ayre is actually the real boss of BSV.Craig Wright allegedly does not hold shares in nChain or CoinGeekAccording to Zhuoer, Wright is only “in name” the chief scientist at nChain, a London-based blockchain-focused research and development firm. The Australian computer scientist does not hold shares in BSV-related companies such as nChain and CoinGeek, Zhuoer notes.He reveals that Ayre is the main backer behind CSW, and that the casino tycoon is focused on making money from the Canadian stock exchange through CoinGeek, a crypto news media site reportedly acquired by Squire Mining for $45 million in December 2018.Zhuoer further notes that CoinGeek develops its own mining machines, and independently runs its crypto-mining operation via Squire Mining. The news media company also controls the Bitcoin SV chain, which many analysts claim is highly centralized.Ayre want to completely control Bitcoin SVThe BSV chain was not forked from BCH because the former wanted to follow a different developmental roadmap, Zhuoer pointed out. He believes that BSV split from Bitcoin Cash because CoinGeek wanted full control of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain.Zhuoer also mentioned that the bitcoinsv.org and bitcoinsv.io domains were registered several months before Wright publicly began taking shots at Roger Ver’s Bitcoin Cash ABC team. Moreover, Wright intentionally created tensions between the ABC and BSV supporters in order to fork the Bitcoin Cash chain, he claims.According to Zhuoer:“[CSW] some very extreme claims that the BCH community [would not] accept, and then incited some community members through extremist claims, just like the Nazis [did] extreme propaganda and incitement, in order to split from the BCH.”Bitcoin SV hard fork increases block sizesGoing on to note some of the extreme claims, Zhuoer mentioned that Wright suggested increasing Bitcoin SV’s block sizes to 2 GB, which could result in major technical problems and have an adverse effect on any blockchain network.Whoops! $BSV has experienced yet another reorg, this time 6 (six!) consecutive blocks were orphaned (#578640–578645), this chain included a 128 MB block #578644 🤦‍♂️ The network was basically stuck for 1.5 hours, and this shows that even 6 confirmations are not enough 🤷‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/dwGZmUCqtm— Nikita Zhavoronkov (@nikzh) April 18, 2019Researchers at BitMEX found that the Bitcoin SV chain was rolled back by two blocks before the activation of the Quasar hard fork, which upgraded the cryptocurrency’s block sizes to 2 GB on July 24. BitMEX’s research team also reported that one of the orphaned BSV blocks was around 62.6 MB in size.Wright’s conduct will become a “heavy liability”Increasing block sizes in this manner also increases the probability of a chain reorganization and may result in another fork, according to analysts.Zhuoer confirmed that he does not support BSV’s development path because Wright’s extreme claims are intended to create tensions among crypto community members.

251,CryptoSlate,Chainlink welcomes Stake.fish as Reviewed Node Operator growing the LINK oracle network,Omar Faridi,1564042560.0,"Stake.fish, a prominent validator for proof-of-stake blockchains, announced on Tuesday that it will serve as a Chainlink “Reviewed Node Operator,” growing the oracle network.Chainlink is decentralized oracle network that securely connects smart contracts to external data sources and various payment networks. Specifically, the platform’s infrastructure has been designed to establish secure connections with APIs in order to obtain external data for blockchain-based smart contracts.According to its official website, Chainlink’s developers plan to help traditional institutions work with smart contracts by connecting to “enterprise-grade” oracles. In order to provide a high level of security, the Chainlink team claims to regularly consults with cybersecurity researchers and computer science academics.Properly implemented smart contracts allow users to enter “tamper proof” digital agreements. However, the inputs and outputs of contracts must also be secured. The Chainlink platform uses special software for reliably secure this smart contract data.Google and SWIFT are using Chainlink’s technology stackThe Stake.fish team believes oracles will play an important role in accelerating the adoption of blockchain-enabled software. Smart contract developers need dependable oracle networks that can provide secure, reliable, and highly available data. Although development teams can build their own oracle stacks, it can be quite time-consuming and may pose security risks.Chainlink’s decentralized oracle platform has been recognized by prominent researchers at Gartner as a highly effective solution for sourcing external data for smart contracts. Giant tech firms such as Google and SWIFT are using Chainlink’s technology stack to create secure communication channels between blockchain platforms and off-chain data networks.Stake.fish aims to leverage its prior experience working as a validator to support Chainlink’s decentralized oracle platform. The proof-of-stake validator has provided services to leading blockchain networks including EOS, Tezos, Algorand, among others.Stake.fish plans to help grow Chainlink communityStake.fish won Game of Stakes, the incentivized testnet for blockchain interoperability platform Cosmos in February 2018. Wangchun, the founder of Stake.fish’s validating services, also co-founded f2pool, one of the largest Bitcoin and Ether mining pools.As a Reviewed Node Operator, Stake.fish will be listed in Chainlink’s official documentation and the Chainlink Explorer (used for tracking activity on the decentralized oracle network). On the Chainlink platform, running a node allows it to provide external data directly to smart contracts.In addition to supporting the oracle network, the Stake.fish team intends to help grow the Chainlink community by attracting more developers and other qualified professionals.LINK token’s price surges by over 1,000% in 2019Chainlink’s native token LINK surged by over 1,000% this year. The dramatic rise in LINK’s price may be partially attributed to the token being recently listed on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro, a platform for professional traders.Last month, Google Cloud developer advocate Allen Day revealed that Chainlink may be used to provide BigQuery data to Ethereum-based smart contracts. Shortly after Day explained the benefits of using the decentralized oracle network, LINK token’s price increased by more than 77 percent within an hour.Posted In: Chainlink, Altcoins, Mining, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

252,CryptoSlate,Quasar hard fork: Bitcoin SV upgrades block size to 2GB,Jonnie Emsley,1564017180.0,"A planned hard fork has been executed on Bitcoin SV (BSV) despite deliberation over the timing of the scheduled upgrade, dubbed “Quasar”.The fork has upped the protocol’s block size limit from 128MB to 2GB—a development that according to the owners of the BSV project, Bitcoin Association, will help BSV scale to “1000+ transactions per second” within months.Questions over timingBitMEX Research described discrepancies over the fork’s timing in a tweet hours before its occurrence—announcing it would occur at 2pm GMT as per Quasar’s code on GitHub; contrary to Bitcoin Association’s original claim it would occur at “approximately” 1pm GMT.Bitcoin SV is expected to hardfork today at around 14:00 UTC.

253,CryptoSlate,"Binance Coin, EOS and Stellar could resume their upward trend despite growing Bitcoin dominance",Ali Martinez,1563874620.0,"While altcoins continue dropping Bitcoin has increased its dominance over the market, reaching 68 percent for the first time since early 2017. Some prominent members of the industry even predict that BTC will capture 80 percent of the market. This technical analysis will evaluate whether Binance Coin, EOS and Stellar have the potential to rebound despite the larger market trend.Binance CoinBinance Coin managed to trade above the 7-week moving average for over 6 months invalidating all the bearish signals along the way. Nonetheless, the latest sell signal given by the TD Sequential Indicator in the form of a green nine in mid-June could not be invalidated. Since then, BNB has corrected nearly 39 percent, breaking below the 7-week moving average for the first time since late December.So far, the selling pressure behind this cryptocurrency has not been strong enough to take it down to the 30 or 50-week moving average. Additionally, last week a hammer candlestick pattern developed. This is a reversal candlestick formation that signals potential capitulation by sellers and a turnaround in the price direction.A move above the 7-week moving average, based on the 1-week chart, could validate the outlook given by the hammer candlestick pattern and a break above the previous high of $39.60 will confirm that Binance Coin is poised to continue its bull rally and make higher highs.BNB/USDT by TradingViewIf BNB is indeed on its way to new yearly highs, the Fibonacci retracement indicator could help identify the different price points that could act as barriers due to the high levels of supply around them. Thus, breaking above the 23.60 percent Fibonacci retracement area that sits around $31.20 could pave the way for Binance Coin to try to test the next levels of resistance around $33.85 and $39.60.However, if the reversal candlestick formation is invalidated, the selling pressure behind BNB could accelerate with the potential to take this cryptocurrency to at least the 30-week moving average that sits around $21.85. This is exactly where the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level is, but before reaching it BNB will have to violate the support given by 38.20 percent Fibonacci retracement level.BNB/USDT by TradingViewEOSFollowing the 458 percent upswing that started in early December 2018, EOS  retraced nearly 62 percent after peaking at $8.65 on May 31.Now that it has reached the 65 percent Fibonacci retracement level on the 1-week chart, a hammer candlestick pattern seems to have been developed last week singling a potential reversal in the direction of the trend from bearish to bullish.EOS/USD by TradingViewAlong the same lines, a buy signal has been given by the TD Sequential Indicator on the 3-day chart predicting a 3 to 12 days correction to the upside. This bullish signal will be validated if there is a green two candlestick trading above a preceding green one candlestick. The upward correction could be targeting the setup trendline that is currently at $6.70, representing a 66 percent surge.EOS/USD by TradingViewIf what can be seen in the bigger timeframes is correct, then a double bottom pattern could be developing in the 1-day chart.EOS may go as low as $3.30 to form the second bottom and the buy pressure will have to increase significantly around this area to take it back up and break through the resistance around $4.30 and at least reach the next resistance level at $6.However, if EOS drops down to $3.30 and volume does not pick up, all the bullish signals previously explained could be invalidated and this cryptocurrency may try to test the 78.60 Fibonacci retracement zone around $3 to $2.80.EOS/USD by TradingViewStellarStellar has not had a great year in terms of price action due to the extreme volatility that it has gone through.After the low of Feb. 06, 2019 when XLM reached $0.073, it experienced a 3 months bull rally that took it up to $0.162 on May 16, representing a 120 percent price increase. Since then, this cryptocurrency lost almost all the value that it gained by plummeting to $0.076 on July 17.Despite the significant pullback that XLM experienced, now it seems like a bullish spinning top candlestick formed last week signaling a potential upward move. This is considered a reversal candlestick pattern that develops at the bottom of a downtrend and has the potential to change the direction of the trend from bearish to bullish.Although the current weekly candlestick seems to be a bearish candle that could invalidate the bullish formation, it is too early to tell whether this week’s candlestick will end in a bearish or bullish posture.XLM/USD by TradingViewNonetheless, a double bottom pattern seems to be developing on the 3-day chart since XLM has gone down to nearly touch the level where it began rising that could allow the weekly candlestick to close in a bullish posture. A spike in volume could be used as a strong indication that this pattern will be validated, which subsequently will validate the spinning top candlestick formation seen in the 1-weekIn addition, a buy signal has been given by the TD Sequential Indicator in the form of a red nine adding credibility to the reversal patterns seen across the 1-week and 3-day chart.XLM/USD by TradingViewInterestingly enough, a head-and-shoulders pattern seems to be forming on the 1-day chart since July 10. At the moment, XLM could be forming the right shoulder and it may drop down to around $0.082 before bouncing off to the neckline that is sitting around $0.094. A break above the neckline could be succeeded by a 22.50 percent upswing, calculated by measuring the height from the neckline to the head of the formation.It is worth noting, that a move below $0.080 could invalidate the head-and-shoulders pattern and a further drop below the Feb. 06, 2019 low $0.073 could jeopardize all the bullish patterns seen in the larger timeframes.XLM/USD by TradingViewOverall SentimentAfter the major upswing that was seen across most cryptocurrencies in the industry, they all appear to have reached an exhaustion point for their bullish trends. That said, in some cryptocurrencies the retracement has not been as pronounced as the pull back that XLM experienced. Even so, it seems like there are different bullish patterns that could be signaling a continuation of the uptrend.Binance Coin and EOS could have developed a hammer candlestick pattern in their weekly chart, while Stellar saw a spinning top candlestick. These are considered reversal formations, which suggest the upswing may resume if volume starts picking up. Nevertheless, given the unpredictability of the markets, it’d be wise to set a stop loss if the market invalidates these signals.Posted In: EOS, Stellar, Binance, Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

254,CryptoSlate,The myth of cryptocurrency halving events: a deeper analysis,Nico Cordeiro,1563880200.0,"Guest post by Nico Cordeiro from Strix Leviathan reposting the article about Crypto Currency halving.Strix Leviathan designs and operates algorithmic trading software for the cryptocurrency markets. The global nature and uncertainty surrounding the nascent cryptocurrency asset class leads to a market that is entirely defined by the behavioral patterns of market participants. Separating fact from fiction and noise from a signal is no easy task in a market with such highly fractured datasets and limited historical precedent. One particular question we decided to explore given the timing is, does a cryptocurrency halving event result in a statistically different return profile that leads to outperformance against the market?Key TakeawaysWe found no evidence that cryptocurrency assets experiencing a halving event outperform the broader market in the six months leading up to and following a reduction in miner rewards.An asset’s return distribution prior to and following a halving is statistically the same as the rest of its return distribution with a high degree of confidence, suggesting that there is no evidence of abnormal pricing action from a shift in supply and demand dynamics.LTC outperformed the market in the months leading up to both halvings but performance fell to the bottom 25% of the market following the first halving.BTC displayed the polar opposite behavior of LTC, with poor relative performance leading up to the halving and a stronger relative performance following the halving.The development of a narrative to explain complex and opaque market behavior persists in every financial market; however, cryptocurrency investors must do so with an extremely limited historical record. This has led to all sorts of unsubstantiated belief systems with scant supporting evidence that are nonetheless widely accepted as true. One such narrative in the cryptocurrency asset class centers around the Bitcoin halving event and can be summarized as follows:The halving of mining rewards has the effect of reducing sell pressure from miners which in turn creates an imbalance in supply and demand that then facilitates a dramatic escalation of price.Perhaps right on cue, commentary around the halving narrative grew exponentially during Q2 of 2019. If you follow both traditional media and social media conversations surrounding the upcoming reduction in miner rewards for the Bitcoin and Litecoin blockchains, then you would suspect the narrative is a settled fact and all one needs to do is HODL in order to reap the excess returns. While the narrative is certainly feasible as a logical theory, it is equally possible that we are dealing with an illusion of validity and previous bull runs were the result of nothing more than increasing levels of speculation within the asset class.Limited sample sizes and historical data make validation of any narrative particularly difficult in this space. So, in order to test the supply and demand theory underpinning this widely accepted narrative, we gathered data on 32 halvings across 24 assets (full list below) that experienced a reduction in miner rewards based on a predefined schedule as well as 320 additional markets for cross-sectional comparison which we define as the market. We then split the data into a one, three, and six-month pre-halving period, a one, three, and six-month post-halving period, and a non-halving period performing the following analysis:Backtested the performance of cryptocurrencies with a mining reward reduction and cryptocurrencies not experiencing a halving during the same timeframe then bucketed each asset’s performance metrics into quartiles.Utilized statistical analysis to determine if an asset’s halving period return distribution was statistically different than the return distribution when the asset is not within a halving period.Before discussing results, it is worth acknowledging two assumptions we find to be implicit if the halving event results in an underlying shift in supply and demand dynamics:An immediate and abrupt shift in supply relative to demand will represent itself in an asset’s price fairly quickly following a miner reward reduction.Cryptocurrencies that experience a halving will, on average, outperform the rest of the market during the post-halving timeframe since one set of assets experiences reduced selling pressure from the mining community while the other set does not.Source: Strix Leviathan ResearchSource: Strix Leviathan ResearchAfter completing our analysis, we found that there is the limited impact of a halving event on pricing action. Examining total return, Sharpe, and Sortino ratios reveal that assets experiencing a halving — both leading up to and following a halving — perform no better than the rest of the market. In terms of the two most prominent cryptocurrencies in which the halving narrative proliferates, Bitcoin (BTC) & Litecoin (LTC), we see the polar opposite behavior. LTC has now outperformed the market twice in the pre-halving period with performance falling to the bottom 25% in the six months following the first halving. BTC, on the other hand, lagged the market leading up to the halving but was in the first quartile of performance following the last halving. The divergence and seemingly random results before and following a halving suggest that the underlying factors driving price are not a shift in supply and demand dynamics.Further evidence suggesting the halving event has a limited impact on market prices can be found by analyzing each asset’s time series and comparing the asset against itself. What we find is that the return distribution of an asset’s halving periods versus the return distribution outside of its halving periods reveals that they are statistically the same at a 99% confidence level. In other words, we did not find evidence that a halving event results in abnormal pricing action and we are dealing with a circumstantial illusion.So what exactly does this mean in a broader sense and for BTC in particular which did outperform the market following the last halving? From a broader standpoint, there is little-to-no evidence within the data that suggests an asset’s pre- and post-halving returns are the result of anything other than broader market sentiment. In regards to BTC, it is possible that the asset experienced greater-than-market performance due to the widespread belief in the narrative amongst cryptocurrency enthusiasts. However, the lack of evidence supporting the theory underpinning the halving narrative when examining a broader group of assets indicates the previous BTC bull runs were equally likely to be the result of other factors. Additionally, we advise against drawing inferences about any single market from a sample size of one.Source: Strix Leviathan ResearchThe supply and demand theory underpinning the narrative is logical and thoughtfully conceived but we would do well to remember that the world of financial markets is filled with tens of thousands of logical and thoughtfully conceived theories that don’t turn out to be true in practice. It appears more likely that the return behavior before, during, and after a halving coincides more with increasing levels of speculation than with an underlying shift in sell-side pressure.This research has been prepared by Nico Corderio and Ava Masucci.

255,CryptoSlate,Bitfinex’s LEO token has a major liquidity problem,Priyeshu Garg,1563852600.0,"LEO, a token issued by Bitfinex’s parent company, iFinex, was revealed to have a major liquidity problem. Bitfinex order books revealed that $500,000 buy and sell orders swung LEO’s price by 25 percent.Bitfinex’s cop-out planLaunched earlier this year, LEO token was issued by iFinex Inc., Bitfinex and Tether‘s parent company based in the British Virgin Islands. The company used LEO to raise funds to cover the $850 million loss it encountered when the funds it sent to a Panamanian payment processor were seized by authorities.Facing accusations of bank fraud, Bitfinex‘s plan to hold an initial exchange offering (IEO) was supposed to alleviate the company from the financial burden it was facing. Paolo Ardoino, the CTO of Tether and Bitfinex, said that the company was able to raise $1 billion USDT in 10 days in a private sale of LEO.. @bitfinex is able to raise 1b USDt in 10 days, in a private sale. Private companies, giants in our industry and outside, made investments for > 100m each. A legion of inside and outside users made investments for > 1m each.— Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) May 13, 2019What made LEO attractive to investors was Bitfinex’s continuous burn mechanism – the company said it would dedicate at least 27 percent of its revenue and the revenue of its subsidiaries to buy back the LEO tokens it sold. Gross revenues from iFinex will be allocated toward the purchase of LEO tokens at market rates until 100 percent of the tokens have been burned, the company said.However, despite the company’s transparency initiative, many have questioned iFinex’s intentions with LEO. While some saw this as a chance to turn over a quick profit in the buy-back, others have advocated for using the token as a long-term asset.No liquidity in LEOSu Zhu, the CEO of Three Arrows Capital, pointed out on Twitter that LEO was a relatively illiquid market. The observation followed a lengthy discussion about the massive outflow of Bitcoin from Bitmex. Some Twitter users argued that the $73 million worth of Bitcoin leaving one of the world’s largest exchanges was used to pump the price of certain altcoins.Many fingers were pointed at LEO, which saw major price fluctuations in the past couple of days. iFinex was quickly accused of using LEO, which was devised as a cop-out plan, as a smart money dumping platform where bigtime traders could turn a big profit.However, Zhu said that it was most likely not the case with LEO. He pointed out that LEO was an illiquid market, where $500,000 buy and sell orders have the potential to swing its price up and down by 25 percent. Buy orders as large as $3 million have previously doubled LEO’s price to $2.00. A $3 million sell order, on the other hand, had sent its price down to $0.93.Guys, $LEO is a relatively illiquid market where a $500k buys sends it to over $1.50 and a $500k sell sends it to $1.12. A $3mill buy sends it to $2.00 and a $3mill sell sends it to 0.93.It's a long-term asset. There's no ""smart money dumping."" pic.twitter.com/xYptFD2bGt— Su Zhu (@zhusu) July 20, 2019All of this, Zhu said, points to the fact that LEO is a long-term asset.Zhu said that LEO has the potential to outperform Bitcoin if Bitfinex was to maintain or increase its market share.I don't think it's an either/or. It can outperform if Bitfinex maintains or increases market share. The burn rate is in BTC notional bc volumes x fees = revenues, so leousd fair value goes up linearly with btcusd going up.— Su Zhu (@zhusu) July 20, 2019However, not everyone seemed to agree with him, with many saying that LEO’s very definition makes it hard to put it in the same basket as Bitcoin. While Zhu said LEO fell into the category of preferred shares, others insisted that LEO’s price/volume action makes it closest to a coupon bond.Let me respectfully disagree, technically it is not a Bond neither is Preferred Shares or royalties, as holders are entitled to nada.

256,CryptoSlate,Bitcoin dominance makes new peak signaling ‘altseason’ could soon be underway,Ali Martinez,1563785640.0,"Bitcoin dominance over the market continues increasing while the interest for altcoins declines without any clear signs of a bullish breakout. But, if the cryptocurrency market behaves like it has in the past, altcoins could soon make a major come back that initiates their bull run.Bitcoin has been in the spotlight after rising nearly 350 percent since mid-December 2018, which has allowed it to decouple from the entire market. The attention that BTC has had not only comes from its price action, but also the ongoing debate that is taking place in the U.S. about the regulations that must be enforced upon this cryptocurrency to avoid its use in illicit activities.Bitcoin dominanceSince its release in Jan. 9, 2009, Bitcoin has entirely dominated the cryptocurrency market. There were several occasions between then and 2017 when its dominance fell under 80 percent, but on average it has always remained above 85 percent. It was not until the 2017 bull market until BTC’s dominance saw its first major drop.As new ventures joined the space and introduced their tokens by forking off other cryptocurrencies or launching initial coin offerings (ICOs), the industry was flooded with new projects that claimed to bring innovation and become the “new Bitcoin.” As a result, speculation took hold over the market and capital started flowing out of BTC into new startups, leading to a significant drop in its dominance.For the first time since its inception, Bitcoin plunged from an 86 percent dominance in Feb. 20, 2017 to 39 percent in early June of the same year while Ethereum rose to 31.5 percent and XRP to 9.4 percent. Despite regaining control of the market to reach a high of 65 percent on Dec. 8, 2017, BTC dropped to a new all-time low of 32.4 percent a month later and since then, its dominance has hovered between 50 and 57 percent.Cryptocurrency dominance chart by CoinMarketCapRecently, Bitcoin has been decoupling from the rest of the market as its price has been able to rise significantly without many of the other cryptocurrencies in the sphere following through. This has led BTC to reclaim 68 percent market dominance while the altcoins appear to be staggered or even making lower lows.In the eyes of Julian Hosp, co-founder of Cake and I-Unlimited, Bitcoin is on its way to capture an 80 percent share of the market as investors seem to be acknowledging the true value behind the pioneer cryptocurrency (unlike many other tokens in the space that lack sufficient decentralization).Seems as if we are heading to an 80% #bitcoin market dominance again that we had prior to the last bubble. This means:1. BTC goes up further2. Alts go down further3. A combo of 1 and 2It is all about true value and it seems the market values $btc a lot. pic.twitter.com/6riZGAGRV8— Dr. Julian Hosp (@julianhosp) July 20, 2019The market recognition that Bitcoin has been receiving could be a direct result from the ongoing discussion in the U.S. about whether Facebook should or should not develop its own cryptocurrency, Libra, that has even brought different government officials such as ranking member of the Financial Services Committee Patrick McHenry to concede that due to the decentralized, permissionless, and trussless nature of Bitcoin, it is an “unstoppable force” that “cannot be killed.”Moreover, a number of media outlets such as CNBC have shown their support for Bitcoin as the only truly decentralized cryptocurrency that has a chance surviving the regulatory forces around the world. This could be one of the reasons why institutional investors are mainly interested in developing BTC products like CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market, Fidelity’s Bitcoin trading desk, and Bakkt’s Bitcoin deliverable futures market, just to name a few.The most important thing about bitcoin? Decentralization, says @JoeSquawk. But Libra does not have that benefit. ""It's not going to do it for me."" pic.twitter.com/1EJjjrSgRz— Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) June 25, 2019Even though there seems to be an outgrowing interest for Bitcoin while altcoins are left behind, there are those who argue that a similar scenario to what happened in early 2017 could develop and BTC dominance could soon plummet again, allowing altcoins to regain an important share of the market.Altcoin volatilityIn a recent Twitter thread, @TheCryptoFam pointed out that investors could be in the disbelief stage of the “psychology of a market cycle,” which could affect their ability to understand the real state of the market by allowing their emotions to impact their trading strategies, making them “prisoners of the moment.”The analyst believes that people tend to have short term memory and since the last time there was a major flow of capital into altcoin was around a year and a half ago, many people in the industry have become skeptical about the true value that altcoins have.6/ The last true alt season ended ~17 months ago in February 2018. This is currently the longest we’ve gone without an alt season. It’s no surprise that many investors are skeptical we’ll have another. People have short memories. pic.twitter.com/TuDtJXabgg— The Crypto Fam (@TheCryptoFam) July 17, 2019Despite the skepticism, @PaddyStash maintains that there could be a new wave of capital flowing into altcoins very soon. According to the cryptocurrency trader, the altcoin index dominance has been contained inside an ascending parallel channel since March 2014. Since then, everytime altcoins dominance reaches the bottom of the channel it bounces off to the middle or the top and when it reaches the top it falls back to the bottom. At the moment, altcoins are trading at the bottom of the ascending parallel channel signaling that a rebound could come at any time.Altcoin market capitalization by TradingViewPaddy Stash thinks that there seems to be an inverse correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin dominance that could confirm that volatility is coming to altcoins. Everytime BTC is at peak while altcoins are at bottom, the latter bounces off while the former goes down. Thus, for the analyst now that Bitcoin has reached a 68 percent market share, it could soon drop significantly allowing altcoins to rise once again.Bitcoin and altcoin dominance by TradingViewEven though Paddy Stash foresees money flowing into altcoins soon, Willy Woo does not see it happening until the end of 2019 or even the beginning of 2020.The partner at Adaptive Capital holds that the first indication that could predict capital injection into altcoins will be a steady and sustained bull run in Bitcoin accompanied with strong on-chain volume that will mute all sell-offs. In addition, Woo stated that a crossover between the total market capitalization of altcoins and the 365-day moving average will signal the next upswing. Based on the current market conditions, this will happen roughly five to seven months from now.365-day moving average relative to altcoin market cap by TradingViewThe next “altseason”It is unknown when the next “altseason” will truly happen, but what is known is that in the past regardless of the fundamentals all altcoins rose at the same time. As a result, investors used to place speculative buy orders on different tokens and wait for the right moment to sell after they surged.8/ In previous alt seasons, every altcoin pumps vs. BTC.

257,CryptoSlate,"Craig Wright’s misinformed attempt at scaling Bitcoin, BSV frivolously increasing block size to 2GB",Mitchell Moos,1563682740.0,"In Craig Wright’s latest marketing attempt, Bitcoin SV will increase its block size cap from 128MB to 2GB. The upgrade will make BSV less secure, more centralized, and more costly for infrastructure providers to maintain.Craig Wright—who has been deemed a fraud by a large portion of the crypto community for claiming to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto—is again, attempting to mislead investors through his latest Bitcoin SV upgrade.The upgrade would increase the block size cap of Bitcoin SV from 128MB to 2GB, an eight-fold increase, which the project claims will allow BSV to “significantly scale” while providing “robust utility” to users, especially enterprises.Bitcoin SV positions itself as the “original” Bitcoin, taking advantage of Craig Wright’s unsubstantiated claims of being the real identity behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The project advertises that, through ‘upgrades,’ it will return to the “original” vision of the Bitcoin protocol by February 2020.Emphatically, those at Wright’s software development company nChain claim that “BSV is Bitcoin.”These preposterous claims are peddled by Craig Wright’s billionaire-backer, Calvin Ayre, who syndicates them through his media company CoinGeek—a crypto publication used almost entirely for shilling BSV and Ayre’s other corporate ventures. Both Wright and Ayre have been able to profit from the Bitcoin brand name by sowing controversy and confusion around Bitcoin.In reality, the latest block size ‘upgrade’ appears to be a marketing gimmick meant to prey on those just learning about cryptocurrency, non-technical investors, and get-rich-quick speculators. For reasons that will be made clear, carelessly increasing the block size of Bitcoin impairs its usefulness.The scaling debate around BitcoinIssues around scaling Bitcoin arose almost immediately after its inception. Hal Finney, the first Bitcoin developer after Satoshi himself, wrote this in 2010:“Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the blockchain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.”Bitcoin’s on-chain capacity is bottlenecked by two factors. The speed at which blocks are created and the size of those blocks. The Bitcoin protocol specifies that blocks should be created roughly every 10 minutes and, through upgrades, has a functional size of approximately 2 megabytes. These factors constrain the network to a throughput of roughly 3 to 7 transactions per second.As a consequence of these constraints, on-chain transactions incur fees. The average fee to send a transaction on the network currently is roughly $3 with a standard confirmation time of anywhere between thirty minutes and two hours depending on the desired level of security. This makes Bitcoin, in its unaltered form, impractical for brick-and-mortar and in-person transactions.Experts in the community, including some of the earliest Bitcoin developers like Finney, argue that on-chain Bitcoin transactions are not designed for small day-to-day payments. There are also many who disagree, like Roger Ver, who forked Bitcoin in August 2017 to increase the block size from 2 MB to 32 MB—resulting in Bitcoin Cash. The nuances of the value proposition and application of Bitcoin are outside of the scope of this analysis but will be explored in the August edition of CryptoSlate Research.The different scaling solutionsIncreasing the block size is one of a handful of workable solutions that could address Bitcoin’s transaction throughput constraints.Deferred settlement: Second-layer solutions like the Lightning network allow users to transact with one another while settling transactions on-chain at a later date. Although there are some tradeoffs and technical limitations to the technology in its current iteration, it has the potential to help Bitcoin scale for small payments that need to be confirmed quickly.Sidechains: By establishing a two-way connection between the crypto assets on a sidechain and the main blockchain (typically Bitcoin) it is possible to augment the capabilities of the main network.One example of a sidechain includes merge mining coins like Namecoin, which allow miners to mine both BTC and NMC simultaneously, functionally providing Namecoin with the security guarantees of Bitcoin’s mining network. Another sidechain is Rootstock, a smart contract platform with a two-way peg to BTC, providing smart contract functionality to Bitcoin users. Although sidechains hold a lot of potential they are still largely experimental and have yet to see major use.On-chain scaling: Finally, there’s on-chain scaling, which increases the block size limit on a network, allowing more transactions to fit in a single block. Simplistically increasing the block size limit is not a workable solution to scaling.Why increasing the block size is problematic for full nodesContinually increasing the block size cap is unworkable because it’s necessary for the Bitcoin ledger to be decentralized and auditable. Auditing the blockchain requires the full, unabridged ledger, which becomes more costly to store and verify as it becomes larger.Hinders full nodes: The primary problem is the cost that’s borne by full nodes, computers set up to verify and ensure that all transactions adhere to the consensus rules of Bitcoin when the block size is increased. An example of a consensus rule is that no transaction output can be double-spent, or that each block may only generate 12.5 new BTC.At a minimum, a full node must download every transaction that has ever taken place, all new transactions, and all block headers. This gets expensive very quickly.“If you make syncing with the current state of the ledger too expensive, only a privileged few can stay up to date, effectively adding a hierarchy to a system which must be flat to function,” wrote blockchain researcher Nic Carter.Industrial servers pay about $0.025 per gigabyte of storage. Using crude calculations, if every Bitcoin block used the full 2MB (30-day average is actually 860 KB), then the annual cost increase for storage for each node:$0.025 per GB * 2/1024 GB * 144 blocks per day * 365 days per year = $2.57The Bitcoin blockchain is already 226GB, which means the total annual cost of storage to every node operator is $5.65 growing at a maximum rate of $2.57 per year.Now, those same numbers for Bitcoin SV with 2GB blocks.$0.025 per GB * 2 GB * 144 blocks per day * 365 days per year = $2,628Something to keep in mind is that full nodes are not compensated like miners. Instead, running a full node allows an entity to make transactions more securely and trustless because they do not need to depend on a third party. It also provides access to higher quality raw data about the network. Different exchanges and service providers, as well as those merely looking to support the network, tend to run full nodes.At the moment, there are over 71,000 Bitcoin full nodes distributed throughout the globe. In contrast, Bitcoin SV has 460 full nodes, many of which are bankrolled by Craig Wright and his cronies.As the calculations above demonstrate, larger blocks make full nodes prohibitively expensive to operate. Consequently, larger locks mean fewer nodes, more centralization, and a cryptocurrency that relies on more trust. And, design and upgrade decisions around Bitcoin are made to minimize trust.Creates data dump scenariosIncreased block sizes also reduce the cost of transactions and provide rooms for services, like VeriBlock, to dump data on a public blockchain. These dumps externalize storage costs to node operators.Just this week Vitalik Buterin proposed doing just that for Ethereum, using Bitcoin Cash as a dumping ground to offload on-chain data.This is already happening on the Bitcoin SV blockchain: one weather app is responsible for 94 percent of the transactions on its blockchain.Large blocks amplify block propagation issuesLarger blocks amplify the orphan block rate, increase the probability of reorgs, and makes double-spending coins easier. This is because large blocks take longer to propagate through a network, the same way that a large file takes longer to download and send to a friend. Moreover, it also means nodes on the network will need faster internet speeds to remain in sync.Orphan block: where two miners find a valid block at a similar time which results in one of the two blocks, and its respective transactions, not being included in the main chain.Reorg: When the client discovers a new, longer sequence of blocks, rendering several blocks and—their respective transactions—invalid. Reorgs are one of the main ways to double-spend coins.These issues make transactions less reliable and less secure for blockchains that use large blocks to achieve scaling.Prevents a sustainable fee market from developingFor a proof-of-work blockchain to be sustainable it’s necessary that miners are compensated for securing the network with their computing power. Miners are compensated through two channels, block rewards and fees.Block rewards subsidize the cost of all transactions at the expense of holders (by increasing the supply). Meanwhile, if a blockchain network is totally fee-based then using the network might be prohibitively expensive, diminishing the value of the network and its respective coin.This represents a tradeoff between subsidizing transactions or maintaining the scarcity of the underlying cryptocurrency. Bitcoin opted for scarcity, halving the block reward every four years and capping its supply at 21 million. On the other extreme, EOSIO wholly subsidizes transactions through block rewards, diluting the value of EOS tokens over time.For a model which emphasizes scarcity then the network must either transition to, or already be, fee-based. It is critical that a network collects a sufficient amount in fees as it transitions to maintain the security of the network against 51 percent attacks and other kinds of mining attacks.No blockchain has successfully implemented a model that entirely relies on fees. At current prices, Bitcoin miners collectively earn $20 million per day in fees and block rewards. Fees are roughly $630,000 of that or 3.15 percent of daily mining revenues. By 2140, 100 percent of Bitcoin mining revenue will be from fees.By the numbersBitcoin SV’s push to increase its block size to 2 GB, and later to have it uncapped, are nonsensical for a few reasons.First, Bitcoin SV rarely takes advantage of its current 128 MB block size cap, mainly because few entities are transacting on the BSV blockchain.90-day average of Bitcoin SV block size by BitInfoChartsOn average, Bitcoin SV uses less than 350 KB per block. The large difference between average block size and maximum block size result in a scenario where services will periodically dump data on the blockchain, causing the spikes in usage seen on a block size chart. Both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV suffer from this issue.Put more simply, if block space is not valuable then it will not be used for valuable applications. A look at transactions relative to fees on the BSV network shows a similar picture.90-day average of Bitcoin SV transactions by BitInfoChartsThe average transaction fee on BSV over the last three months was $0.002. With an average 81,200 transactions per day, that generates a total of $162.4 in fees for miners.If Bitcoin SV wishes to maintain the scarcity in its supply through halvings like Bitcoin, then fees will need to increase substantially. Otherwise, after the next halving Bitcoin SV will experience a downward shock to its network hashrate, making it vulnerable to additional 51 percent attacks.Block size as a marketing gimmickWith a better understanding of the block size debate, it becomes obvious that Craig Wright and his henchmen are using it as a deceptive marketing tactic. For example, in a statement from nChain CEO Jimmy Nguyen:“Miners need to be aware that massive scaling is critical for their profitability—especially after the next block reward halving in May 2020… For mining to remain profitable, miners need to earn more in transaction fees from each block to compensate for the lower block reward subsidy. This is only possible on BSV,” said Nguyen.Nguyen’s comment completely misses the real issue. Bitcoin SV does not generate enough in mining fees because few people want to transact on an insecure blockchain with coins which are of dubious value. By increasing the block size it merely suppresses the cost per transaction, keeping the overall network mining revenues relatively the same while increasing centralization and spam-uses.The CEO then goes on to cite the May 21, 2019, test block, where for the first time a 1.42 GB block was mined on the network. Allegedly, this resulted in transaction fees that exceeded the 12.5 BSV block reward subsidy.“This is how Bitcoin’s economic model is meant to work, and this is what Satoshi always envisioned to ensure miners remain profitable,” asserted Nguyen.However, as shown above, Bitcoin SV uses 332KB per block on average—a pitiful 0.253 percent of its 128MB cap. For context, Bitcoin uses 878KB of its 2MB block space, representing 42.9 percent utilization.Steve Shadders, nChain’s CTO, explains the next step in BSV’s devolution. In the future Bitcoin SV will conduct its “Genesis” upgrade, where it will completely remove the block size limit, allowing for blocks of infinite size. Allegedly, this would allow for “infinite scaling of the BSV network.The BSV network will ‘upgrade’ to Quasar and increase the block size from 128 MB to 2 GB on July 24, 2019.Posted In: Altcoins, Opinion, People, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

258,CryptoSlate,"Binance Research: most large Bitcoin and Ethereum investors hold stablecoins, use cold wallets",Omar Faridi,1563586380.0,"The research arm of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has published a report that analyzes the results of a survey completed by institutional digital asset investors. According to the report, Binance surveyed over 100 institutional and VIP clients.Survey results cannot be generalized due to the small sample sizeThe Binance team mentioned that the survey results should be interpreted with “extreme caution” and must not be generalized, because of the relatively small sample size of only 41 institutional and VIP clients.As stated in Binance’s report, over 50 percent of the exchange’s VIP clients hold positions for at least a week. Meanwhile, a third of Binance’s institutional traders take part in high-frequency trading and various other market-making strategies.Notably, Binance’s survey results indicate that clients with a bigger portfolio tend to trade across several different exchanges, whereas clients with less capital may trade on a single or a select few platforms.High-frequency traders increasingly engage in cross-platform arbitrage strategiesHigh-frequency traders, who may hold positions for less than a day, tend to trade on several different exchanges in order to engage in cross-platform arbitrage strategies. This approach allows traders to take advantage of price differentials across multiple platforms, Binance’s report noted.Binance’s management pointed out that around 90 percent of its clients use USD as the benchmark currency. This, as USD-backed stablecoins and USD-denominated trading platforms dominate the cryptoasset industry, Binance’s report confirmed.Nearly all institutional clients use stablecoinsThe Binance team revealed that almost all survey respondents said they use stablecoins for trading purposes or as a store-of-value (SoV). While USDT remains the dominant stablecoin, PAX and USDC are also used frequently to engage in trading or to hold value, the report mentioned.Stablecoin usage (%) across institutional and VIP clients (source: Binance)Approximately 20 percent of Binance’s institutional clients that responded to the survey said they use the crypto-backed Dai stablecoin.Majority of clients use OTC desksAs noted in Binance’s report, 87 percent of survey participants stated that they use over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks such as Huobi OTC, Galaxy Digital, and Binance Trading Desk.According to Binance’s survey results, most clients have experience working in the financial sector, as only 7 percent of respondents said they had no prior exposure to financial markets before they began trading cryptoassets.Most clients have been trading crypto for over a yearThe majority of Binance’s institutional and VIP clients revealed they had been trading digital assets for at least a year. In fact, only 7 percent of Binance’s survey participants said they had been involved in crypto trading for less than a year.Current experience in the cryptoasset industry (source: Binance)Approximately 50 percent of Binance’s institutional clients had traded in traditional equity markets and around 25 percent said they engage in foreign currency trading.Notably, 67.5 percent of survey respondents engage in leveraged trading through futures contracts or margin borrowing, Binance’s report noted.Large investors keep funds mainly in cold storageClients with cryptoasset portfolios worth at least $25 million keep most of their holdings in cold storage wallets or use trusted third-party custodial solutions, according to Binance’s survey results.The report concluded that a certain amount of user funds must be held on centralized exchanges in order to engage in efficient market-making and prop-trading strategies. However, this may change if decentralized exchanges such as Binance DEX begin to attract more users and experience greater trading volumes.Storing methods for cryptoassets (source: Binance)Interestingly, most institutional investors (two-thirds) do not keep funds in hot (online) wallets such as Binance’s Trust Wallet or the Coinbase Wallet, the report revealed.DEXs not used frequently due to low liquidityAccording to survey respondents, traders do not frequently trade on decentralized exchanges due to regulatory uncertainty. Binance’s institutional clients also mentioned that DEXs usually lack sufficient liquidity, and have a poor or non-intuitive user experience.Non-custodial crypto platforms not yet popular among large tradersOne-third of Binance’s clients that participated in the survey said they use custodial lending and borrowing services such as BlockFi or Nexo. As stated in Binance’s report, the majority of traders that use crypto lending and borrowing platforms have a long-term investment strategy.Other survey results suggested that non-custodial digital asset borrowing/lending service providers are not yet widely used by institutional clients. This, as only 12 percent of those surveyed by Binance’s research division reported using these platforms.Major risk factors: technology failures, hacksBinance also asked its institutional and VIP clients to identify potential risks and growth factors for the digital asset industry. The majority of traders cited concerns about technology failures and security breaches. Survey respondents also noted that changes in regulations across different jurisdictions may pose a significant level of risk to the cryptoasset industry.Other risk factors, according to survey respondents, included Tether’s legal problems and privacy issues related to cryptocurrency transactions.ETFs could accelerate crypto ecosystem growthCrypto industry growth drivers identified by Binance’s institutional traders include the potential introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, established brokers such as Fidelity offering crypto-related services, and the development of options contracts.Binance’s survey respondents also believe that the launch of stablecoins by Facebook and J.P. Morgan may be seen as a positive development for the crypto space. Physically-settled crypto futures contracts offered by companies such as Bakkt and LedgerX may help accelerate the growth of the blockchain and digital asset sector, survey participants suggested.Some respondents also said that Samsung’s crypto-related services such as a built-in smartphone wallet could potentially increase digital currency adoption.Crypto infrastructure development highly undervaluedAccording to Binance’s institutional survey respondents, blockchain infrastructure development by projects such as ICON, Nebulas, and Zilliqa, is among the most undervalued segments in the crypto space. Store-of-value, payments, and settlements provided by Bitcoin, Monero, and XRP were also identified as undervalued by Binance’s clients.Only 15 percent of respondents said the decentralized applications (dApps) ecosystem may be undervalued at present.Many large investors don’t use Binance, results may not be accurateWhen asked to predict Bitcoin dominance, which currently stands at around 60%, most survey participants said BTC’s crypto market share would remain roughly the same or go down slightly by December 2019.While these survey results may be interesting, Binance’s management pointed out that there are still many large crypto industry participants that do not use the exchange’s services. This may suggest that the survey’s findings may not accurately represent the point of view and current trading patterns of large institutional players in the digital asset market.The full report (PDF) can be downloaded here.Posted In: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Altcoins, Privacy, Wallets     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

This, according to a post from a Reddit user, who revealed that all social media accounts associated with the Claymore token have now been deleted.As explained by its creators, the Claymore cryptocurrency was as an ERC-20 compliant, peer-to-peer (P2P) “cash token.” The total supply of CLM tokens was capped at 74.9 million, and the cryptocurrency was being actively traded on DDEX, a leading decentralized exchange for Ethereum tokens.Claymore’s developers also claimed that the digital currency was created to help prevent financial manipulation and minimize the adverse effects of high volatility.

He also mentioned that the website did not have a link to a whitepaper and the LinkedIn profiles associated with the project were fake.Notably, a video posted to YouTube by MicLabTV (on July 14, 2019) pointed out that the Claymoretoken.com website appears to have been hacked. A message on the website states that it was hacked by “the #1 Indian Ethereum Pentesting team – r0p00 CR3W.”The hackers also left a message for John (the CEO of the Claymore token project) that reminded him to change passwords when working on new projects. According to details shared by MicLabTV, he personally lost a significant amount of money as the value of the CLM tokens has dropped by more than 90% in the past two days.He also revealed that before the Claymore token website went down, his name was mentioned on the website as he was a social media promoter for the project.Posted In: Altcoins, Price Watch, Scams     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Total cap should correct 80%. Most of the damage of decline will occur to altcoins. pic.twitter.com/DssCIL4H0R— Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) July 16, 2019An 80 percent correction from Bitcoin’s latest parabolic advance from $3,130 to $13,800 could imply that this cryptocurrency will depreciate to nearly $5,000, which is somewhat more optimistic than Tone Vays’ idea of a move down to $2,800. Although it is too early to tell whether any of these bearish scenarios will be possible or not, this technical analysis will evaluate the different levels of support that could hold BTC from a further drop.Bitcoin Technical AnalysisAccording to Josh Rager, a technical analyst, an 80 percent correction will be devastating to most crypto assets, but the $8,000 support level could be able to contain the price of Bitcoin from such as severe decline.This 80% correction that Peter speaks about is the measured move of 300%+ of the parabolaWould not be an 80% correction from 0 to topThis will certainly be a blow to most assets and BTC has strong support in the block shown below near $8000 pic.twitter.com/YwOaMAHQh8— Josh Rager 📈 (@Josh_Rager) July 16, 2019As a matter of fact, when looking at the Fibonacci retracement indicator on the 3-day chart it seems like Rager could be pointing out that the 50 to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement zone could act as a strong barrier of support due to the high concentration of demand around this area.Now that Bitcoin appears to have broken below the major support cluster given by the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level and the support trendline that formed since late March, which could have been triggered by a 375 BTC sell order in Bitstamp as Josh Olszewicz explained, it could indeed be heading down to the he 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level.BTC/USD by TradingViewIn addition, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), which is commonly used to follow the path of a trend and calculate its momentum, had a bearish crossover between the 12-three-day exponential moving average and the 26-three-day exponential moving average on the 3-day chart adding credibility to the major correction overseen by Peter Brandt.The last time BTC experienced a bearish MACD crossover on the 3-day chart was on Nov. 9, 2018, which saw its market valuation depreciate more than 50 percent from $6,420 to $3,130.BTC/USD by TradingViewAdding to the bearishness, Bitcoin seems to be moving outside of the ascending parallel channel that has been developing since mid-December 2018. Due to the longevity of this channel, a candlestick close and an open below it could accelerate the selling pressure behind BTC significantly dropping its price down to at least the 50 and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement zone previously described.BTC/USD by TradingViewNonetheless, as the technical analyst Bob Loukas stated, there is still a chance that instead of retracing abruptly Bitcoin will go through a consolidation phase in the next 4 months that could eventually take it to around $8,000 and this level of support could act as a rebound point to take this cryptocurrency up to new highs.#bitcoin's intermediate term trend is almost certainly over now. A corrective phase appears to be well under-way, selling heavy, but at some point re-accumulation to hold the line. I would not be surprised to see a 4 month (2-Cycle) consolidation from here. pic.twitter.com/3k9XIuJLrc— Bob Loukas (@BobLoukas) July 16, 2019To Luke Martin, this corrective phase could indeed be a trading range between $13,000 and $9,700 where Bitcoin could spend the near future trading before a break above or below these levels that could pinpoint where it is heading next.For most investors the most important info that a $BTC chart conveys is structure:-Ranging-Uptrend-DowntrendBitcoin was ranging until Apr 1st. The uptrend lasted ~3 months. Price has been ranging for ~2 weeks.Below 9700 or above 13k could break price out of current range. pic.twitter.com/KEWCEHMboZ— Luke Martin (@VentureCoinist) July 16, 2019Under this idea, the 12-hour chart shows a parallel channel that started in mid-June, which could contain the price of Bitcoin before a clear break occurs. So, if the current 12-hour candlestick is able to close above the 100-twelve-hour moving average a lot of credibility could be added to this scenario and a rebound to $11,100 or the 50-twelve-hour moving average could be expected.It remains to be seen whether the 100-twelve-hour moving average is able to hold because a confirmed break below it will take Bitcoin down to the 150 or the 200-twelve-hour moving average, which is sitting at $9,200 and $8,000 respectively.BTC/USD by TradingViewIt is worth noting that a move down to $8,000 will only represent a 40 percent retracement from the high of $13,800, which is normal during a Bitcoin’s bull market and helps maintain bull trend healthy.The most recent bull market that BTC had, for instance, lasted more than two years and represented 10,000 percent gains from the low of Aug. 25, 2015, when Bitcoin was trading at $198, to the high of $19,760 on Dec. 17, 2018. During this time span, there were eight significant corrections.The high of $501 on Nov. 3, 2015, was followed by a 40.39 percent pullback, while the high of $784 on June 17, 2016, experienced a 38.37 percent retrace. After an all-time high was achieved on Jan. 4, 2017, when Bitcoin was valued at $1,180 it dropped 36.50 percent. Two months after the milestone, BTC hit a new all-time high of $1,320 on Mar. 8, to then fall 32.57 percent.Since that time BTC began reaching higher highs every couple of months. On May 25, the cryptocurrency went up to $2,746 and immediately pulled back 31.38 percent. The high of June 12 when one BTC was worth $2,985 was followed by a 39.20 percent correction. A similar pattern happened after the high of Sept. 1 and Nov. 6 that saw Bitcoin drop 40.12 and 30.09 percent, respectively.BTC/USD by TradingViewOverall SentimentThe overall sentiment in the market is bearish due to the number of sell signals that have been triggered under different time frames, such as the bearish MACD crossover on the 3-day chart and the break of the ascending parallel channel on the 1-day chart.Despite Peter Brandt’s bold prediction of an 80 percent correction that could take Bitcoin sub $3,000 levels, it seems that at the moment this cryptocurrency could likely retrace to around $8,000, which will represent a 40 percent pullback that based on historic data will help keep the bullish trend healthy.There is a small probability that Bitcoin could actually go through a consolidation phase between $13,000 and $9,700, but it will all depend on its strength to get back above the 100-twelve-hour moving average before the current 12-hour candlestick closes.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

261,CryptoSlate,"Are Cardano, Chainlink and Ravencoin doomed to continue falling?",Ali Martinez,1563271380.0,"After the major surge in mid-December 2018, the market seems to have found an exhaustion point. The retrace gives an opportunity for sideliners to buy in before the next upswing. Although the plunge has been more drastic in altcoins than in Bitcoin, this technical analysis will evaluate whether Cardano, Chainlink and Ravencoin are doomed to continue falling.CardanoAfter moving between the 16.18 and 38.20 percent Fibonacci retracement level for nearly two months, Cardano broke below support and reached the 61.80 percent Fibonacci retracement area where it is currently trading at. If this price point is able to hold, then ADA could be preparing to rebound to the 50 or even the 38.20 percent Fibonacci retracement zone.An upswing could indeed be expected now that Cardano has reached the 40.50 percent retracement target given the ascending triangle that was forming on the 3-day chart.Therefore, in order for this cryptocurrency to go back up to the 50 or the 38.20 percent Fibonacci retracement level, the setup trendline must hold and a buy signal in the form of a red nine should be given by the TD Sequential Indicator on the 1-day chart. Since ADA is currently trading on a red seven there could be another two days of bearish momentum before a bullish signal is given by this technical index, which increases the likelihood for a continuation of the downward trend that could take Cardano to the 78.60 percent Fibonacci retracement level or around $0.045. Everything will depend on the price action seen before the green nine is given by the TD Sequential Indicator.ChainlinkChainlink recently experienced a significant increase in its market valuation rising from $1.11 to $4.80 in a matter of sixteen days. After Google announced that it was integrating it into its cloud-based services, and Coinbase Pro as well as Coinbase revealed that the token was going to be listed under their platforms, the token saw these outlandish gains.Following the upswing, 1.4 million LINK tokens were transferred from Chainlink’s “development wallet” into Binance leading many analysts in the cryptocurrency community to believe that the company was preparing for a major sell out, which as detailed in their whitepaper could have been to cover expansion costs and operating expenses.Regardless of the actual reason behind the 1.4 million LINK tokens transferred, this cryptocurrency has corrected more than 50 percent from the high of $4.80 on June 29 and several indicators could suggest that it is trading at a pivotal point where it could continue declining or regain some of the value that it has lost.On the 1-week chart, for instance, the TD Sequential Indicator gave a sell signal in the form of a green nine candlestick forecasting a pullback that could last for 1 to 4 weeks before the continuation of the bullish trend. Now that LINK has corrected for 2 weeks, it reached the 7-week moving average, which is currently holding it from a further drop.If this moving average is not able to contain the price of Chainlink, then it could try to find support around the 30 and 50-week moving averages that are sitting between $1.2 and $0.9.Nonetheless, the support given by the 7-week moving average could likely hold LINK from further depreciation and act as a rebound zone since it seems like a bull flag is developing in the 3-day chart. This is considered a continuation pattern that forms after a strong upward movement, known as the flagpole, and is preceded by a consolidation period, known as the flag. The bull flag predicts a 64 percent target to the upside that was determined by measuring the height of the flagpole.If Chainlink is able to move above the 38.20 percent Fibonacci retracement level the bullish outlook seen on the 3-day chart will be validated and LINK could be on its way to reach new all-time highs, but breaking below the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level could indicate that the support given by the 7-week moving average is vanishing and this cryptocurrency will be doomed for a further depreciation.Thus, the price action between the 50 and the 38.20 percent Fibonacci retracement level could be seen as a no trade zone and investors should wait for a break of support or resistance before entering a trade.RavencoinRavencoin broke below the 7-week moving average around 3 weeks ago and since then it has dropped nearly 40 percent. Now, this cryptocurrency could be finding some level of support around the 30-week moving average based on the 1-week chart.Along the same lines, the parallel channel that developed since mid-March on the 3-day chart shows that its bottom could be containing the price of RVN. If the channel is able to hold, then a rebound to the middle or the top of the channel could be expected.However, moving below the parallel channel could accelerate the selling pressure behind this cryptocurrency pushing its price further down.The Fibonacci retracement levels on the 1-day chart could be used to determined whether the parallel channel seen in the 3-day chart will continue suppressing Ravencoin. At the moment, it seems like a move below the 61.80 percent Fibonacci retracement level could be catastrophic for RVN since the next level of support is sitting around $0.025. On the other hand, an open candlestick above the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement zone could be hinting that it will at least try to reach the middle line of the parallel channel.Overall SentimentDespite the significant correction that most of the coins analyzed have seen in the past few weeks, they all seem to be holding at pivotal points that could allow them to regain some of the value they have lost or increase the selling pressure behind them. Since this seems to be the case for Cardano, Chainlink and Ravencoin, investors should wait for a break of support or resistance before entering a trade.The bearish sentiment seen in most of the altcoins can also be seen in Bitcoin which according to 40-years trading veteran Peter Brandt it could be at the cusp of violating the “parabolic advance” that started in December 2018. A break below the parabolic phase could trigger an 80 percent drop from current levels in BTC, taking the entire cryptocurrency market down with it.If current parabolic phase is violated, we could expect either an 80% correction of 7-month advance or much smaller correction w/ definition of new parabola w/ shallower slope. $BTC Note formation of possible 2-wk H&S or H&S failure pic.twitter.com/6IF1bHREAv— Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) July 7, 2019Posted In: Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

262,CryptoSlate,Algorand misrepresents its performance against Bitcoin,Priyeshu Garg,1562923500.0,"Blockchain startup Algorand cited incorrect Bitcoin stats while marketing its own network. The startup claimed that its network handled over 50,000 transactions in less than a month, which it said was equivalent to what Bitcoin does every six months when the network actually does 1.8 million transactions in that time.Algorand says it had a successful month following token saleAlgorand, a Boston-based blockchain company created to improve blockchain decentralization, made the news last month after it successfully completed a $60 million token sale. The company’s token sale implied that Algo token’s market capitalization was close to $6 billion, which would make it the seventh-largest coin—above Binance’s BNB and just below EOS.The company’s successful token sale and mainnet launch didn’t last long though, as Algo’s value plummeted just days after the sale. But, the company maintained that everything was going according to plan, saying they had a successful month.Algorand issued various marketing texts citing their accomplishment during the last month. The company’s CEO Steven Kokinos participated in several AMA sessions, answering questions about the state of the network.However, the company’s claims were put to the test by a well-known independent cryptocurrency analyst and blogger, who found that some of the data Algorand provided was not only exaggerated but completely incorrect.Crypto blogger calls out Algorand for sharing wrong statsThe analyst, who goes by the name of Hasu on Twitter, called the comparison “incredibly disingenuous marketing” by Algorand. He found several instances where the company used incorrect data when comparing its transaction volume to that of Bitcoin.While it’s unclear where the text was pulled from, the same wrong data is used on two separate occasions.Incredibly disingenuous marketing by Algorand, claiming BTC does 50k transactions every 6 months. In reality, BTC does 27k payments (tx equivalent) *every hour*, 120M payments every 6 months. It's not a mistake, the claim is being repeated in AMAs by Algorand's CEO @stevekokinos. pic.twitter.com/thnQRYXctu— Hasu (@hasufl) July 11, 2019According to Hasu’s tweet, Algorand claimed it handled over 50,000 transactions since the launch of its mainnet less than a month ago. That, the company said, was equivalent to “roughly 6 months of Bitcoin transactions.”According to data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin network is confirming almost 300k transactions per day as of July 2019.This wasn’t a one-time mistake, either. Steven Kokinos, the company’s CEO, used the same data during an AMA.“In the first two weeks of live mainnet, over 50,000 transactions have been processed, which is roughly equivalent to 6 months of Bitcoin transactions or 2-3 months of Ethereum transactions,” he wrote.And while Kokinos and Algorand were quick to react to the twitter thread, issuing an apology for using wrong stats, the crypto community still found it to be odd for a data-conscious company.I’d like to reiterate the same.

263,CryptoSlate,"Markets go into freefall as Bitcoin drops by 11.6%; Chainlink, Binance Coin, Basic Attention Token resilient",Mitchell Moos,1562811300.0,"The cryptocurrency markets went into freefall as Bitcoin dropped from $13,063 to $11,497, an 11.6 percent drop over the course of 19 hours. The altcoin market saw even greater damage, with the average altcoin losing 12.8 percent. Falling prices do not appear to be attributed to any major news.The market is seeing double-digit losses across the board without any major attributable news. Bitcoin reported trading volume is up from July 9 values from $28.2 billion to $33.6 billion—a 19.1 percent increase.Overall market capitalization took a major hit falling from $342 billion to $299, evaporating $43 billion in capitalization value.Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance remains at highs not seen since the 2017-2018 bull market. With dominance relatively unchanged this means that BTC dragged most of the market down with it.For a continued healthy bull trend, large drops to the downside are not abnormal. Bitcoin’s extreme volatility (compared to the traditional equities market) means that swings to both the upside and downside are expected.Market bull Thomas Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global, summarizes this phenomenon:reminder, Bitcoin is a hypervolatile asset.This is great for volatility and other dedicated traders.For most, taking a long-term view is more appropriate https://t.co/NX5FruWVEx— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) June 27, 2019Some may attribute this volatility to ‘major news,’ but the vast majority of announcements have a nominal impact on the Bitcoin price, despite what pundits and crypto publications may suggest.Notable coins that weathered the drop were all product-related coins, including Chainlink (-4.67%), Binance Coin (-6.98%), Basic Attention Token (-6.95%), and Maker (-7.19%).Of the top 10, the coins that saw the largest losses included the two major BTC forks Bitcoin SV (-18.98%), and Bitcoin Cash (-18.45%). TRON (-16.57%) also experienced abnormally large losses.Realized price per Bitcoin continues to climb to make new yearly highs, which is the average approximate price each holder paid for their coins.On average, investors paid $5,233 for their coins versus the current market price of $11,497—meaning that the average hodler is still up 119 percent.

264,CryptoSlate,"How much $1,000 invested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin at the 2017-18 market top would be worth today",Mitchell Moos,1562806200.0,"The cryptocurrency markets peaked in 2018 at a total capitalization of $835 billion. If an investor purchased $1,000 in crypto at the market’s top how much would their investment be worth at today’s prices?During 2017, the crypto markets came to a head as the confluence between rising prices, media attention, feverish initial coin offerings, and 100x altcoin breakouts lead the market to crescendo to highs yet to be matched again.CRYPTOCAP chart by TradingViewDuring that time, investors could have easily quintupled their money in the months leading up to the market peak. Thousands of retail investors were swept-up in the mania. Investors mortgaged their homes, maxed out their credit cards, and sold their belongings thinking the parabolic growth would continue.These investors were incinerated as the markets plummeted. It would be over a year before the markets stopped hemorrhaging.Now as the cryptocurrency markets rally, how would an investor have fared if they made a $1,000 investment at the peak of the market?A look at the numbersBelow is the list of cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization at the market peak on Jan. 7, 2019. At the time, common advice was to use market capitalization as a proxy for the perceived ‘safeness’ of each investment. Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum were even considered the ‘blue chips’ of crypto, signifying their soundness. Yet, a year later, the returns tell a different story.In order of top 10 by market capitalization on Jan. 7, 2018:By best performers:The performance of these assets since January 2018 could be attributed to a variety of different technical and fundamental factors.Bottom performers3/4) IOTA and XRP: Pundits described IOTA and XRP as two of the most “hyped” projects of the 2017 bull market.Both coins saw unsustainable parabolic growth to their prices. From Nov. 1st, MIOTA went from $0.378 to $4.07—a 10-fold increase. XRP went from $0.20 to $3.38—a 16-fold increase. For reference, over the same time span, the overall market capitalization increased from $170 billion to $835 billion, under a 4-fold increase.Both projects were appealing because of their technological answers to solving the blockchain scalability problem. In December 2017 CryptoKitties clogged the Ethereum network, while Bitcoin average transaction fees hit a high of $55 that same month.Both projects also tackled attractive niches: internet-of-things and banking. As the markets corrected, investors may have realized that these solutions were still far from widespread market traction.2) Cardano: Ada was also a bottom performing digital asset. Some of the losses could be attributed to conflicts between the Cardano Foundation, IOHK, and Emurgo that resulted in lackluster community management until late 2018.Alongside IOHK and Emurgo, the Cardano Foundation is one of the primary governing bodies for Cardano. One of the Foundation’s primary responsibilities is marketing and driving brand awareness to the project.And, up until 2019, it largely failed according to the community. The Foundation was embroiled in controversy as it failed to meet most of its self-described targets. These failures resulted in community outrage. Petitions called for the removal of Foundation chairman Michael Parsons and gained thousands of signatures, and Parsons soon after resigned. In May 2019 Cardano continued to make strides in improving its community presence.Other reasons for poor performance may relate to Cardano’s philosophy of slow, but methodical, platform development. Cardano did not deploy its mainnet until October of 2018. IOHK has continued to maintain its strategy of slow, albeit consistent development.1) NEM: A $1,000 investment in NEM would be worth a mere $43 today. NEM’s niche was largely as a white-label token issuance platform that allowed anyone to launch their own cryptocurrency with “no programming needed.” The platform was arguably outdone by Ethereum as the majority of ICOs and new token launches happened on the ETH blockchain.The NEM Foundation, the community’s nonprofit meant to promote the blockchain, was also “mismanaged,” further exacerbating the platform’s decline.“Basically we realized we had a month to operate, due to the mismanagement of the previous governance council,” said Alex Tinsman, who took over as president of the Foundation in January of 2019.Top performers3) Ethereum: The incumbent smart contract platform has been relatively salient to losses compared to other top 10 market capitalization investments. From a technical perspective, this may have to do with its strong correlation to Bitcoin price movements.According to Longhash and BitInfoCharts, Ethereum is one of the most strongly correlated assets to Bitcoin. Nevertheless, upwards moves for BTC tend to have less of an impact (but still larger than other cryptos) on ETH, and smaller retracements tend to result in gains relative to BTC. However, large downward moves for Bitcoin tend to have an even larger impact on Ethereum.From a fundamental level, Ethereum’s appreciation could stem from the continued development of the ecosystem and sustained developer growth. Ethereum still leads in terms of the number of active developers working on the platform and the platform has continued to make steady progress towards proof-of-stake ETH 2.0.2) Litecoin: The silver to Bitcoin’s gold has seen an astronomical rally over the last quarter largely attributed to the upcoming LTC halving on Aug. 5. The strong movement may reflect a change in investor’s perception of Litecoin’s scarcity as the mining emission rate for the coin drops.That said, if history repeats itself LTC could see a major correction. As the halving becomes “priced in” it is possible for the market to overreact to the news and push LTC into overbought territory. If so, Litecoin could experience a drop similar to the 73 percent correction leading up to the first halving in July 2015.1) Bitcoin: The predominant cryptocurrency has by far lead in terms of performance. Part of the reason may stem from Bitcoin’s typical role in market cycles. Although, enthusiasts claim that Bitcoin’s features and salience are the reason for its recent performance.Based on previous bull markets, altcoins do not peak until Bitcoin finishes its rally. During the 2017 bull market, the altcoins that more closely correlated with BTC—Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash—peaked in December, shortly after Bitcoin. Ethereum and XRP followed in January.Since the market trend only reversed from bearish to bullish in May, some pundits bullish on “altseason” have suggested that altcoins will continue to underperform until BTC peaks.Several top crypto-influencers have asserted a meaningful counterpoint. The markets may have “learned its lesson” on altcoins since the last boom and bust, claiming altcoins may never see another parabolic market.If you enjoyed this, tweet @mitchellmoos for topics you want covered.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

265,CryptoSlate,"EOS, Tezos, and BitTorrent showing signs of a major price movement",Ali Martinez,1562385780.0,"After the recent 30 percent correction that Bitcoin experienced, some altcoins are showing signs of a possible breakout while others have indicators of further decline. This technical analysis will explore whether EOS, Tezos and BitTorrent are preparing for an upswing or a nosedive.EOSFollowing the high of $8.65 on May 31 EOS’s market valuation pulled back over 35 percent, reaching $5.55 on June 27. Due to the significance of the correction, the Parabolic SAR, which is displayed as a series of dots on top and below the price of EOS and helps identify potential reversals points in the direction the price is moving, flipped on the 1-week chart signaling a change in the trend from bullish to bearish.The probabilities for the current downward momentum increase since EOS has also moved below the 7-week moving average so a further drop down to the 50 or 30-week moving average, which are both sitting around $4.60, could be expected.EOS/USD chart by TradingViewThat being the case, EOS will have to break below the ascending parallel channel that developed since mid-December 2018 on the 3-day, which has the potential to accelerate the selling pressure if confirmed because of its longevity.However, if the parallel channel continues to hold, then this cryptocurrency could be about to rebound to the middle or the top of the channel..EOS/USD chart by TradingViewNow that EOS is trading around the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level a move above $6.20 could signal that the ascending parallel channel on the 3-day chart will not break and this cryptocurrency could try to test the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level.Conversely, a move below the recent low of $5.55 could validate what can be seen on the 1-week chart and EOS could be heading down to test the 50 or the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement zone.EOS/USD chart by TradingViewTezosAfter falling 24 percent last week, Tezos has managed to recover the value that it lost, which could have resulted from a deal worth well over a billion dollars that the team behind it recently closed with BTG Pactual, one of the largest investment banks in South America, and Dalma Capital, a Dubai-based asset management firm.[Press release]: BTG Pactual and Dalma Capital to utilize #Tezos blockchain for Security Token Offerings (STOs): https://t.co/4fgPBvEWj9— Tezos Foundation (@TezosFoundation) July 3, 2019At the moment, a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern formed on the 1-week chart since this week’s candlestick is overlapping the body of the previous one. This is considered a bullish formation that is likely to reverse the bearish trend seen over the last 6 weeks.It is worth noting that bullish engulfing patterns tend to be more effective when they are preceded by four or more red candlesticks and get confirmed once the succeeding candlestick closes above the engulfing one.XTZ/USD by TradingViewThe 3-day chart adds credibility to the idea that the trend could indeed change from bearish to bullish as it seems like a spinning top candlestick pattern formed. Although this technical pattern represents indecision about the future of XTZ since neither the buyers nor the sellers were able to take control of the price action, it has the potential to reverse the trend due to the increasing buying pressure that this cryptocurrency has had lately.In addition, the fact that Tezos has moved once again above the 7-three-day moving average is a positive sign. If the next candlestick remains above the 7-three-day MA, XTZ could break above the 30-three-day MA confirming the beginning of a new bullish trend.XTZ/USD chart by TradingViewOn the way up, Tezos will have to first break above the $1.44 resistance level so that it can test the next level of resistance at $1.80 and possibly reach new yearly highs. It will be wise to pay attention to the $1.15 support level because a break below it could invalidate the whole bullish perspective and take XTZ down to $0.89.XTZ/USD chart by TradingViewBitTorrentSince its release at the beginning of the year, BitTorrent’s price action has been characterized by significant upswings and long consolidation periods. On the 1-month chart, it seems like the moves are part of a series of bull flags. The 212 percent surge that took place in May, for instance, appears to be the result of a bull flag breakout that had formed three months before.Currently, there seems to be another bull pennant developing under this time frame. This is considered a continuation pattern that forms after a strong upward movement, known as the flagpole, and is preceded by a consolidation period, known as the pennant. The bull pennant predicts a 212 percent target to the upside that was determined by measuring the height of the flagpole.BTT/USDT chart by TradingViewThe consolidation phase that BTT is currently going through can be better seen on the 3-day chart. This cryptocurrency has spent the last month mostly trading between the 38.2 and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level.Therefore, a candlestick opening and trading above the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level could be the first indication that a breakout could soon come while a candlestick opening and trading below the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level could signal that the bull flag will be invalidated.BTT/USDT chart by TradingViewThe move above or below the 38.2 and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement zone could happen at any time since the Bollinger Bands on the 1-day chart have been contracting. This is known as the Bollinger Bands squeeze and it indicates that a period of low volatility could be about to come to an end and high volatility will likely take over.Although this technical index does not predict in which direction the price will move, the Fibonacci retracement levels on the 3-day chart will help forecast the trend.BTT/USDT chart by TradingViewOverall SentimentEven though EOS appears to have the potential to correct further down, the ascending parallel channel that has contained its price since December 2018 could hold and sustain bullish price action, similar to Tezos and BitTorrent.If that is the case, then all of these altcoins could be about to enjoy a period of high volatility that could take them to new yearly highs. It remains to be seen whether the support levels will hold and the resistance points will break so that a new upswing begins, but patience and confirmation will be the key that allows traders to profit from the price movements that will soon hit the cryptocurrencies analyzed.Posted In: EOS, Tezos, Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

266,CryptoSlate,"As Bitcoin bounces, are Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin on their way to new yearly highs?",Ali Martinez,1562066280.0,"Following Bitcoin’s rebound from $9,600 support, the market seems to be bouncing and giving signals that the retrace is over. This technical analysis will determine whether Ethereum, XRP and Litecoin will continue falling or if a bull trend is about to resume.The whole cryptocurrency market seems to be going through a corrective period following the exponential move that nearly took Bitcoin to $14,000. Due to the speed of the recent upswing, a significant pullback was needed to keep the bullish trend healthy. The bounce is taking a handful of top altcoins with the trend.EthereumA spinning top candlestick pattern formed last week on Ethereum’s 1-week chart. This technical formation represents indecision about the future direction of this cryptocurrency since neither the bulls nor the bears were able to gain control of the price action. However, since the current candlestick is a green nine, which is a sell signal per the TD sequential indicator, when combined with the spinning top candlestick pattern the probabilities for a significant correction increase.If Ethereum breaks below the 150-week moving average, which acted as a strong point of resistance for 5 weeks and now it appears to be acting as strong support, its market valuation could experience a sharp decline down to the 50-week moving average that is currently sitting around $190.ETH/USD chart by TradingViewOn its way down, Ethereum will have to break through the Fibonacci retracement levels that could behave as barriers due to the high concentration of demand around them. This technical index predicts that if ETH was to correct down to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement zone, which represents a 32 percent decline from the current price level, it could find support around the $256 and $223 levels, based on the 3-day chart.ETH/USD chart by TradingViewAlong the same lines, the ascending parallel channel on the 1-day chart could be indicating that if the bearish signals seen on the bigger timeframes are validated, Ethereum could go down to the bottom of the channel. This technical pattern began developing in mid-December 2018 when ETH was trading at $83 and has since then it been able to contain its price action.Every time Ethereum reaches the top of the channel it retraces to the middle of the channel or the bottom and then bounces off to the top once again. Thus, a similar scenario could be underway.Since this cryptocurrency is currently trading around the middle line of the channel it could go down to the bottom, which is also where the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level sits, and bounce off to new highs marking the end of the correction.ETH/USD chart by TradingViewXRPAfter failing to break above the $0.46 resistance level, XRP pulled back to the $0.38 support where it seems to be forming a reversal candlestick on the 1-week chart. Although it is too early to tell if the current candlestick will indeed take XRP up, the price action that this cryptocurrency has had during the past 6 weeks could signal that an upswing back to the $0.46 resistance level is likely to come.Nonetheless, if the selling pressure continues to increase and XRP moves below the $0.38 support level it could try to test $0.30.XRP/USD chart by TradingViewOn the 3-day chart, there is no sign of an upswing back to resistance nor a break of support. Based on this timeframe it will be wiser to wait for a move above the 7-three-day moving average in order to take a bullish stance or a move below the 30 and 50-three-day moving average to take a bearish stance.XRP/USD chart by TradingViewYet, the ascending parallel channel that can be seen on the 1-day chart could actually add credibility to the idea that XRP will bounce off from the $0.38 support level to test the $0.46 resistance level again. This formation developed over a month ago and could be forecasting that if volume starts picking up and XRP is able to rise again, it could reach the middle or the top of the channel, but if the buy pressure is enough to make it break out of the channel a 35 percent upswing upon the break could be expected.XRP/USD chart by TradingViewLitecoinThe Litecoin halving—a fixed event that occurs every four years after 840,000 blocks are mined, which reduces the mining reward by 50 percent—is just 34 days away and different technical patterns are indicating that this cryptocurrency could be preparing for a major pullback.On the 1-week chart, for example, an evening doji star candlestick formation developed over the last 3 weeks. This is a bearish reversal pattern signaling that if Litecoin breaks below the $115 hurdle point it could go down to the next level of support at $93.5, $70, or even $57.LTC/USD chart by TradingViewIf the bearish formation previously described is validated, then the ascending parallel channel that can be seen on the 3-day chart where Litecoin has been trading since mid-December 2018 could be about to break to the downside.Due to the longevity of this parallel channel, a break out could accelerate the selling pressure resulting in a massive correction. But, if the channel continues to hold, a move up to the middle or the top could be expected with the potential to take this cryptocurrency to new yearly highs.LTC/USD chart by TradingViewTherefore, if the evening doji star candlestick formation and a break below the ascending channel are confirmed, history will likely repeat itself and Litecoin could fall another 40 percent to try to test the support given by the 200-day moving average on the 1-day chart just as it did in 2015. This could take the cryptocurrency back to $70, representing a 53 percent correction from the recent high of $147.LTC/USD charts by TradingViewOverall SentimentUnder the longer-term timeframes, Ethereum and Litecoin appear to be turning bearish while XRP looks bullish. Conversely, the short-term outlook signals that the ascending parallel channels where all of these cryptocurrencies have been trading could allow them to bounce off from support sometime soon.Usually, the broader perspective outweighs the narrower one, so even if ETH and LTC rise during the next few days it does not necessarily mean that they will make higher highs. As a matter of fact, the bullish signal will be given once, and if, these two cryptocurrencies are able to move above their recent yearly highs. In order to take a bullish stance it will be wiser to wait for Ethereum to move above $363, XRP above $0.42 and Litecoin above $147.Posted In: Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

267,CryptoSlate,Chainlink skyrockets 117.2 percent after listings on Coinbase Pro and Coinbase retail,Mitchell Moos,1561806480.0,"ChainLink, a blockchain platform aiming to connect smart contracts to external data sources, is on a tear following listings on Coinbase Pro and Coinbase—the altcoin surged 117.2 percent, from $2.03 to $4.41, over the three days the listings were announced.The “Coinbase effect,” where a cryptocurrency’s price surges after its listing is announced on Coinbase, is alive and well for Chainlink. The altcoin highly lauded by speculators surged 117.2 percent three days after its first listing on Coinbase Pro.LINK/USD chart by TradingViewSince the phenomenon was first observed, some sources reported that the Coinbase effect was diminishing. The diminishing impact on price could be attributed to Coinbase’s looser standards for adding digital assets or greater access to reliable exchanges.Yet, nearly all coins listed on Coinbase still immediately see a jump in price following the news. The following coins saw the following percent increase in price eight hours after listing:May 3rd, 2017, Litecoin increased by 3.0 percent.Dec. 19, 2017, Bitcoin Cash increased by 9.9 percent.Apr 17, 2019, Augur increased by 15.3 percent.May 30, 2019, EOS increased by 10.1 percent.One exception to this news was XRP’s retail listing on Feb 28, 2019, which only rose 0.22 percent. However, there is evidence that insider trading from a potential leak of the announcement diminished the price impact of the listing. CryptoSlate will explore the Coinbase effect in greater depth in an upcoming CryptoSlate Research article.Back to Chainlink, the coin saw a 16.3 percent increase 8 hours after its listing on Coinbase Pro, and experienced a 23.5 percent surge 12 hours afterward. Following LINK’s listing on the Coinbase retail platform, the coin surged 34.1 percent; 12 hours following the retail listing it saw a 62.8 percent cumulative jump.The greater impact on Chainlink’s price may be a function of its status as a smaller altcoin with lower volumes and more limited availability on other major exchanges, especially those with a strong presence in the United States.Binance was the exchange with the largest trading volume of the coin prior to the listing. On June 29, Binance recorded 24-hour LINK/BTC volumes of $328 million and LINK/USDT volumes of $193 million.

268,CryptoSlate,"Litecoin and DigiByte founders cryptographically proved they created their blockchains, why can’t Craig Wright?",Priyeshu Garg,1561774860.0,"In May 2016, Charlie Lee and Jared Tate, the creators of Litecoin and DigiByte, cryptographically proved they were the creators of their blockchain platforms in less than a minute. If Craig Wright is truly Satoshi Nakamoto as he claims, why doesn’t he do the same on the Bitcoin blockchain?A single signature could end the Craig Wright saga once and for allIt has been more than three years since Craig Wright became the main focus of the crypto world by declaring he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the true creator of Bitcoin. And while the Australian programmer certainly wanted to make a big entrance, the community reaction has been less than welcoming, to say the least.Some, of course, believed Wright and the vague and mostly circumstantial evidence he has so far provided is sufficient to back his claims. And, a small group of people, oftentimes supporters of Bitcoin SV, do indeed believe these claims.The majority, however, found Wright’s claims to be nothing short of absurd. Of course, that didn’t stop Wright from making dozens of public appearances, giving countless interviews, and authoring numerous blog posts where he elaborated about his involvement in the creation of Bitcoin.All of that could have been avoided, though, if Wright just used the key of Bitcoin’s Genesis Block to sign a message. The genesis block is the first block of the blockchain—with block height 0.  By signing a message using the keys of the Genesis Block, Craig could once and for all prove he possesses the key which only Satoshi has access to.Actual blockchain creators showed Wright how to prove he invented BitcoinThis was something Charlie Lee and Jared Tate, the respective creators of Litecoin and DigiBytes, knew even back in 2016. More than three years ago, Lee tried to put an end to Wright’s ludicrous claims by showing him how a blockchain creator can prove his identity.On May 2, 2016, Lee used the key of Litecoin’s original block to sign a message saying “I, Charlie Lee, am the creator of Bitcoin.”Here's my proof. Simple. No need to have a proof ceremony and a long blog post.https://t.co/icmGGTKPsZ— Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) May 2, 2016Tate, the founder and CTO of DigiByte, soon followed suit by signing his own message. The message, where he stated he was the creator of the DigiByte blockchain, was sent from an address from the network’s first block, created on Jan. 10, 2014.Just like @SatoshiLite w/ #Litecoin Here is simple proof I am the creator of #DigiByte #blockchain #Satoshi #Verify pic.twitter.com/6gAZCmlGpp— Jared Tate (@jaredctate) May 2, 2016As only the creator of a blockchain, in this case Bitcoin, would have access to the key associated with the Genesis Block, signing a message with that key would be the ultimate proof of ownership.It’s everything to do with CSW. Charlie Lee signed the Litecoin genesis block. Its all CSW needs to do with the Bitcoin genesis block. He has refused to do so. He’s a fraud.— Max (@maxtannahill) April 18, 2018Wright seems to have been aware of this when he provided the list of Bitcoin addresses as part of a court proceeding. Wright claimed that he did not remember the specific addresses that would prove he mined the first blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain, but said that he could just look up addresses from the block rewards on the blockchain.However, researchers quickly found that Wright just scraped the blockchain for early block reward beneficiaries and claimed those as his own addresses. The list of the first 70 block reward addresses, not including the Genesis block, line up perfectly with the redacted list Wright filed in court.Posted In: Litecoin, Altcoins, People, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

269,CryptoSlate,"Bitcoin pairs continue to fall, Binance Coin, TRON, and NEO due for further decline?",Ali Martinez,1561698840.0,"The cryptocurrency market seems to have reached an exhaustion point after the recent upswing that took Bitcoin to almost $14,000. Now, it seems like a correction could be taking place before the bullish trend continues. This technical analysis will explore if Binance Coin, TRON, and NEO are due for a further decline.Binance CoinSince late December 2018, Binance Coin has been trading above the 7-week moving average invalidating all the sell signals given by the TD Sequential Indicator in the 1-week chart. This is can be seen as a clear sign of the strength of the bullish trend.Last week, a new sell signal was given by the TD sequential indicator predicting a 1 to 4 weeks correction before the continuation of the bullish trend. Due to the strong support that the 7-week moving average poses, a break below it could confirm that a retrace is underway that could take BNB to test the 30 or 50-week moving average.Nonetheless, the bearish signal will be invalidated if the 7-week moving average continues to hold and Binance Coin manages to move above the recent high of $39.6.BNB/USDT chart by TradingViewAdding to the bearishness, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), which is commonly used to follow the path of a trend and calculate its momentum, had a bearish cross between the 12-three-day exponential moving average and the 26-three-day exponential moving average indicating that a correction is likely to come.The last time the 12-three-day EMA moved below the 26-three-day EMA was at the beginning of May, which resulted in a 22 percent retrace that lasted 5 days.BNB/USDT chart by TradingViewIn addition, a bearish divergence can be spotted on the 1-day chart since the price of Binance Coin has been reaching higher highs while the relative strength index (RSI) has been making lower lows.Although this bearish formation does not provide a precise selling point, combined with the different technical indexes previously described, it could be signaling that the momentum that this cryptocurrency has gone through could soon change in direction from bullish to bearish.BNB/USDT chart by TradingViewTRONTRON’s market behavior appears consistent when analyzed from a larger timeframe, such as a 1-week chart. Under this timeframe, it can be seen how since the beginning of the year TRX was trading within a $0.006 range between $0.023 and $0.029 until it finally broke out around mid-May.Now, this cryptocurrency is trading within a new range between $0.029 and $0.038. Since the price movement seen last week took TRON to the top of the range at $0.038, a move down to the bottom at $0.029 was expected and that seems to be exactly what this cryptocurrency is doing at the moment.If the $0.029 support is able to hold once again, TRX could bounce off to the top to try to test the $0.038. TRX/USD chart by TradingViewThe move down to the $0.029 support level could also be confirmed by the double top formation seen in the 3-day chart. This is an extremely bearish reversal pattern that developed after TRX reached the $0.038 resistance level two consecutive times. A move below $0.031 will confirm the pullback to the 50-three day moving average that is sitting around $0.029.However, if TRON gets back above the 7-three-day moving average it could be a sign that it will break the $0.038 resistance level and try to test the next hurdle point at $0.049.TRX/USD chart by TradingViewNEOA series of support and resistance levels based on historical data can be drawn on NEO’s 1-week chart to help determine the different price points that will act as barriers, preventing its price from getting pushed up or down.Recently, the upswing that NEO had was rejected by the $20 resistance level. Although this level of resistance has been tested twice over the last two weeks, it has been able to hold and stop this cryptocurrency from reaching new yearly highs.Since support and resistance levels become weaker when they are tested multiple times, a break above $20 could happen the next time NEO rises, which could take it to reach the next level of resistance at $31.It is worth noting that due to the high concentration of supply seen around $20, a pullback to the $13 support point could be expected before NEO tries to reach higher highs.NEO/USD chart by TradingViewThe pullback could materialize since NEO just reached the top of the ascending parallel channel where its price action has been contained since the beginning of December 2018 based on the 3-day chart.Even though this cryptocurrency seems to be bouncing off the middle line of the channel which is a bullish sign, the buying pressure must increase or it will indeed fall to the bottom of the channel.NEO/USD chart by TradingViewThe 1-day chart adds credibility to the idea that a correction to around $13 could be possible as it seems like a spinning top candlestick pattern had developed. This candlestick formation could be signaling a reversal since it was succeeded by a red candlestick.In addition, since NEO is currently trading below the 7-day moving average a further drop to the 30 or 50-day moving average could be possible, which is exactly where the $13 support level sits at.The only way to consider that the bullish trend will continue is if NEO moves above the 7-day moving average and the following candlestick opens above it.NEO/USD chart by TradingViewOverall SentimentThe entire cryptocurrency market has gone through a major rally since late 2018. Binance Coin, for instance, has gone up 861 percent while TRON and NEO around 280 percent. Up to now, there has not been any significant correction since most of the bearish signals given by different technical indexes had been invalidated.Now, the market once again is giving signs that a retrace could be underway and this can be seen across all the cryptocurrencies previously analyzed. Although it seems like the retrace is taking place at the moment and a further drop could be expected, it will be wise to wait for confirmation before taking a stance on the state of the market.Posted In: Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Meanwhile, altcoin/BTC pairs—including Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin—are getting decimated as funds flow into the predominant cryptocurrency.Bitcoin’s rally continues to accelerateBitcoin is once again on a tear. After breaking $10,000 just four days ago, the coin is now nearing the $12,000 price level. Reported 24-hour volume is at robust $26 billion compared to the 7-day average trading volume of $20 billion.BTC/USD chart by TradingViewThe last time BTC traded at $12,000 was at the end of January of 2018, shortly after the market started to decline from its peak. The year-long bear market followed as prices plummeted.BTC/USD chart by TradingViewCurrent state of the marketCurrently, Bitcoin dominance, the percentage of overall market capitalization attributed to BTC, is climbing towards its previous two-year high.During the previous bull market, BTC dominance reached a high of 69.46 percent in December of 2017. It then dropped sharply the following month, falling to 35.11 percent as altcoins underwent their historic eye-popping rally.BTC Dominance chart by TradingViewAs a function of growing dominance, altcoins are depreciating relative BTC, with most major altcoins experiencing single-digit losses in the last 24-hours.Coinbase Pro BTC PairsOf the top 10 altcoins, Ethereum lost the least value relative to Bitcoin with the pair only losing 5.0 percent of its value.Bitcoin outperforms altcoinsAs a function of growing BTC dominance, Bitcoin has outperformed nearly all altcoins since the beginning of the year.Over the last six months, the only top 10 coin to outperform Bitcoin has been Litecoin—which appears to largely be driven by the upcoming halving—with gains of 340.5 percent compared to BTC’s 219.9 percent.Top 20 coins by CryptowatchOf the top 20 altcoins, Ontology and NEO have also outperformed Bitcoin over the last six months, with gains of 455.2 and 252.0 percent, respectively.Altcoin season on the horizon?Historically, altcoins do not peak until Bitcoin finishes its rally.

271,CryptoSlate,"Algorand token sale implies $6 billion market cap, ranking above Binance Coin and below EOS",Priyeshu Garg,1561089780.0,"Algorand, a Boston-based blockchain company, raised over $60 million in a token sale held on CoinList. When combined with the Algorand Foundation’s token distribution fund of 2.5 billion Algos it would have a market cap of $6 billion, putting it at seventh above Binance Coin and below EOS.Algorand’s token sale implies a $6 billion valueA young blockchain company that aims to create a truly democratic and efficient public ledger just completed its token sale which would put it among the top 10 crypto companies by market capitalization.Algorand, a Boston-based company created by MIT professor Silvio Micali, completed its inaugural Algos auction on June 19. According to the company’s press release, the auction sold out in under four hours due to oversubscribed demand from a large group of global participants.Each token was sold for $2.40 in a Dutch Auction, where the price of the coin is gradually reduced until a buyer is found. When combined with the 2.5 billion Algos that the Algorand Foundation is holding in order to participate in securing the Algorand network, the coin currently has a market capitalization of $6 billion.This puts Algos among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap—just below EOS (EOS), which has a market cap of $6.48 billion, and above Binance Coin (BNB) and its market cap of $5.30 billion.This week’s equity funding matched the $66 million Algorand raised in the past year from major venture capital firms such as Union Square Ventures and Pillar Venture Capital.The same day, Algorand also launched its mainnet, just two days after it open-sourced its node repository.Apart from the incredible amount of tokens sold, Algorand made news as it was among the first companies to offer a refund policy on its tokens. According to the company’s website, auction buyers will be able to return their tokens at 90 percent of the purchase price up to a year after the sale.Token auction plan could increase Algorand’s market cap to $24 billionInstead of holding one large token sale, Algorand opted to have sales on a rolling basis. The Algorand Foundation website states that the company plans on auctioning off 600 million Algos coins every year for five years until the total supply reaches 10 billion coins.Source: Algorand FoundationIf the coin was to keep roughly the same price as it had in the latest sale, Algorand would have a market cap of $24 billion. While it’s hard to predict how much the market cap of other top cryptocurrencies will grow, at the current state of the market, Algorand would be the third largest coin, just after Ethereum.However, many researchers believe the company’s valuation is a bit unrealistic. Analysis from ICO Drops found that while the hype around Algos was high, so was its risk rate. The expected ROI from the coin was also rated as normal, which means that the coin could retain a relatively stable value. Nonetheless, a market cap of $24 billion will most likely be unsustainable.The Algorand foundation also said that it won’t use its Algos reserves to transact. Instead, the foundation will keep its full allocation online and use it to contribute both to the overall governance of the network as well as the process of “responsible decentralization.”Algorand’s mission could be too optimistic to succeedFounded in 2017 by Turing Award and Gödel Prize-winner Silvio Micali, Algorand was designed to improve blockchain decentralization. The platform utilizes the Byzantine Agreement protocol in order to reach consensus among network participants. Similar to a proof-of-stake protocol, Algorand’s consensus mechanism allows minimal computation in order to qualify as an honest block producer.The company made headlines thanks to its approach to decentralized consensus that randomly and secretly selects new block generators and validators in every step of the voting process. The protocol also assumes that 2/3 of the block producers are honest, which would make forking virtually impossible—a notion that was heavily criticized by many cryptanalysts.As the network offers no incentives or financial rewards to honest block generators, honest nodes can simply go offline due to a lack of monetary support. A recent research paper argued that it was also possible to bribe validators and fork Algorand.Posted In: U.S., Altcoins, ICOs     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

273,CryptoSlate,"After a turbulent year, Digitex Futures unveils plan to become a DAO",Mitchell Moos,1560757080.0,"Digitex Futures made the headlines on several occasions this year, and not always for the right reasons. Recently, the commission-free Seychelles-based futures exchange with plans to overtake BitMEX announced ambitious plans of becoming a DAO, according to CEO Adam Todd.Don’t miss this surprise video update by @realAdamTodd where he explains that #DigitexFutures is converting into a #DAO! 💫 💫The #Exchange will be community owned and will benefit #DGTX holders & traders! Check it out: https://t.co/bgWJp4yul2— Digitex (@DigitexFutures) June 17, 2019What Is a DAO?A DAO, or a decentralized autonomous organization, is an organization that uses the blockchain to mitigate the need for a corporation or employee hierarchy. Instead, holders of a token in a DAO typically decide on matters of governance through voting via smart contract.Like Bitcoin, which removes the middleman in payments, a DAO is meant to do the same for any area of business which has repetitive functions, such as paying salaries and suppliers. A DAO behaves like a company with digitally enforced rules.Not many companies have managed to decentralize their organizations, yet, but smart contracts are seeing increasing adoption, especially for reducing repetitive tasks. For example, JPMorgan is planning to preprogram a myriad of back-office tasks using smart contracts.The announcement from Todd is a step forward in governance, but it also exposes the organization to additional risk should there be a vulnerability in the smart contracts or a breakdown in governance participation.The DAO hack was a learning moment about smart contract lifetimes, and how to bake software maintenance & upgrades into SCs.— Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) April 9, 2017A DAO, not the DAOIf that acronym sounds familiar, it’s because “The DAO” was a disastrous hack caused by a loophole in a smart contract soon after Ethereum’s launch. An opportunistic miner was able to drain roughly $60 million from The DAO, which later by vote, resulted in Ethereum splitting from Ethereum Classic in 2016.Yet, the Digitex CEO seems unfazed by the potential security complications around DAOs. In his video update, he reassured the community that “times have moved on from then,” and that the technology is “pretty much bullet-proof.” Whether the market will react in the same way to these risks is another matter.The transition from corporation to DAOOwnership of Digitex Futures will be transferred to the community over the next five years, with Adam Todd relinquishing 80 percent of his equity ownership in Digitex Ltd to further decentralize governance by blockchain.On Oct. 1, 2019, Digitex will create one billion new tokens, the DigiDAO token (DGDAO). These tokens represent equity ownership in the exchange and will be locked into a smart contract and released on a daily basis to DGTX holders over the next five years.Unlike an STO, these tokens are not being sold but instead dealt out to DGTX holders in proportion to the number of tokens owned. The only caveat: holders must keep their DGTX in their account on the Digitex exchange. That said, there is no lock-up period and depositors can withdraw their tokens at any time.Impact of decentralizationThe Digitex community has continued to wait for the organization to fulfill its promise of actually launching an exchange. The transition to the DAO appears to add even more complexity to the already difficult task.By transferring all voting, governance, and ownership rights to the DGDAO token, the DGTX token will likely be a security in the sense that it entitles owners to the future cash flows of the exchange, but the decentralization of the project may insulate Digitex from litigation.Additionally, by encouraging traders to hold DGTX in their accounts over five years to accrue DAO tokens, the supply is consequently restricted, which should result in a higher value for the coin. As noted in the addendum on the Digitex website:“Demand for DGTX from investors who are attracted to this daily dividend will compete with demand from traders who must own DGTX to trade on the exchange’s futures and spot markets, creating increased competition for DGTX.”The TakeawayCompeting in the highly competitive exchange market against incumbents such as BitMEX is an ordeal. Whether the company’s bet to transition to a DAO will reassure investors and help the company build its reputation is highly uncertain. The litmus test will be whether Digitex will finally be able to launch its exchange.

A push up to the 50-week MA could be expected.Nonetheless, if selling pressures rises and XLM moves below the 7-week MA, then it would probably try to test the 30-week moving average.Source: XLM/USD chart by TradingViewAn inverse head-and-shoulder pattern formed on the 3-day chart predicting a bearish to a bullish trend reversal. A move above resistance, also known as the neckline, could signal a sharp upswing which will need to be confirmed by a large spike in volume that will help validate that the pattern is actually a breakout.This technical formation projects a 47 percent profit target that is obtained by measuring the distance between the head and the neckline and adding it to the breakout point. A move below $0.120 could give the first signs that the head-and-shoulders pattern will be invalidated and breaking below the right shoulder will confirm it.Source: XLM/USD chart by TradingViewA bull pennant formed on the 1-day chart and could be in its breakout stage. This is considered a continuation pattern that developed after a strong upward movement, known as the flagpole, and was preceded by a consolidation period, known as the pennant. This bullish formation predicts a 45 percent target to the upside that was determined by measuring the height of the flagpole.Now that XLM seems to be breaking out of the pattern, it could be on its way to reach the target mentioned before. But, if instead, it reverses and moves below $0.116, the bull pennant will be invalidated.Source: XLM/USD chart by TradingViewCardano (ADA)Since the beginning of April, Cardano has been consolidating, mostly between the $0.07 support and the $0.10 resistance level, despite a move down to $0.06 in early May.Now, ADA is trading around $0.09 indicating that it could soon try to test the $0.10 level of resistance once again. Breaking above this price point could take it up to the next supply barrier sitting at $0.13.Source: ADA/USDT chart by TradingViewAn ascending triangle could be forming on the 3-day chart, based on the price movements that allow for a horizontal line to be drawn along the swing highs, at $0.10, and a rising trendline to be drawn along the swing lows. Although this is a continuation pattern, since the price usually goes in the same direction as the trend before the triangle formed, a breakout can occur to the upside or downside.If Cardano breaks the $0.10 resistance level with enough volume, it could go as high as $0.135, which is the target given by the bullish formation.Conversely, a move below the 7-three-day moving average could indicate that ADA is about to fall to around $0.06 depending on the strength of the support provided by the 30 and 50-three day moving averages.Source: ADA/USDT chart by TradingViewTRON (TRX)TRON spent most of the year trading within a $0.006 range, between $0.023 and $0.029. Around mid-May, it finally broke out of that trading range to reach the $0.038 resistance level, which rejected the price of TRX and precipitated a retrace to $0.029.Based on TRON price action on the 1-week chart, it can be presumed that it will trade between $0.029 and $0.038. Therefore, this cryptocurrency could be on its way up to test the $0.038 level of resistance once again, but breaking above this price point could take it up to $0.049.Source: TRX/USD chart by TradingViewOn the 3-day chart, TRX is trying to move above the 7-three-day moving average, which will confirm the continuation of the bullish trend and a possible test of the $0.038 resistance level.Failing to trade above the 7-three-day MA could take this cryptocurrency down to the 30 or 50-three day MA.Source: TRX/USD chart by TradingViewOverall SentimentDespite the reduced price action that the cryptocurrencies previously mentioned have had in respect to Bitcoin, it seems like they are just about to continue the bullish trend and potentially make new yearly highs. It seems like it is just a matter of time before a breakout occurs, and patience will play a key role in profiting from the next upswing.It is worth noting that since the beginning of the year most of the cryptocurrencies in the space have surged more than 100 percent in value, so there is a nontrivial chance for a major correction. At this point, to minimize risk and exposure, it is wise to wait for confirmation before entering a trade.Posted In: Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

The announcement took LINK to a new all-time high, surging 70 percent within an hour of the release.Google integrates ChainlinkAllen Day, a Google Cloud developer advocate, described in a blog post how Chainlink could be used to make BigQuery data available inside an Ethereum smart contract. The integration would reduce blockchain platform risks, mask transactions making them anonymous, and settle speculative bets on prediction marketplaces, such as Augur.Learn how to use Chainlink services to provide data from #BigQuery crypto public datasets on-chain, which helps reduce inefficiencies & enables new on-chain business models to emerge by adding entirely new capabilities to Ethereum smart contracts ↓ https://t.co/yVekclgafQ— Google Cloud Platform (@GCPcloud) June 13, 2019Day revealed that Chainlink’s service also allows for the creation of “oracle,” a mechanism that finds and verifies real-world occurrences and adds this information to the blockchain for use in smart contracts.“This assembly of components allows a smart contract to take action based on data retrieved from an on-chain query to the internet-hosted data warehouse. At a high level, Ethereum Dapps (i.e. smart contract applications) request data from Chainlink, which in turn retrieves data from a web service built with Google App Engine and BigQuery.”According to Allen Day, many inefficiencies encountered by developers who are building hybrid applications can be reduced with the implementation of Chainlink services and in some cases new features can be added to Ethereum smart contracts, which in turn allow them to take full advantage of cloud-based services and blockchains.Chainlink SkyrocketsShortly after Google’s blog post was published, Chainlink shared the news on Twitter, which lead many investors to speculate that the smart contracts firm had closed a partnership with the search engine giant.We're thrilled to share that Google is one of the great companies integrating #Chainlink into their approach to smart contract adoption.

A break below this moving average could take Tezos down to around $0.90, where the 50-three-day MA is currently sitting at.To the upside, there is strong resistance at $1.40, $1.85, and $2.50.The TD Sequential Indicator has given a buy signal with a red nine candlestick on the 1-day chart. Although the bullish setup has not been validated yet, if a green two candlestick starts trading above a green one TXZ could try to reach the setup trendline at $1.60.The Bollinger bands are beginning to squeeze on the 12-hour chart indicating that a period of high volatility could come soon. Also, a double bottom or “W” pattern could be forming, which predicts a reversal move to where Tezos started falling, which is around $1.60. This could validate the outlook given by the TD Sequential Indicator on the 1-day chart.Overall sentimentTezos has experienced a 450 percent increase in its market valuation since the beginning of the year. Even though the recent news has not had a direct impact on its price, it seems like TXZ could be about to surge another 30 percent.This cryptocurrency has demonstrated its ability to self-amend and self-govern by going through its first voting process and as the year progresses there will likely be more updates coming from the Tezos Foundation.Posted In: Tezos, Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

278,CryptoSlate,Buy the rumor and sell the news: TRON and BitTorrent technical analysis,Ali Martinez,1559706300.0,"On May 26, Justin Sun, the 28-years old CEO of TRON, revealed that he was working on “something huge and amazing” that will impact the future of TRON and BitTorrent, but that the announcement will be made in early June. As rumors began spreading the market valuation of these two cryptocurrencies started surging. TRON and BitTorrent value rose more than 50 percent within days after Sun’s tweet.On June 3, in a press release, Justin Sun announced that he had spent $4.6 million in a bidding contest to have lunch with Warren Buffett in an attempt to influence the Berkshire Hathaway CEO to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptos. Although many saw the move as a marketing stunt, the market reacted quickly dropping the price of TRX and BTT around 20 percent.As it was seen above, breaking news and other reported events usually can have a short-lived impact on the market valuation of cryptocurrencies. In this case the saying “buy the rumor, sell the news” took effect as the first piece of information released increased the prices of TRON and BitTorrent, but the actual announcement was taken as a sell event.Now, a deep technical analysis will help determine where TRX and BTT may be heading.TRONOn Nov. 25, 2018, TRON hit a low of $0.011 and since then its market valuation has appreciated approximately 270 percent to reach a high of $0.041 on June 2.On its way up, TRX was not able to break above the setup trendline. At the moment, a green nine has been formed on the current candlestick predicting a three to twelve days correction, based on the TD Sequential Indicator on the 3-day chart. The sell signal could get invalidated if TRON is able to go higher than the recent high of $0.041.A series of support and resistance points can be drawn on the 1-day chart. Currently, TRON is trading between the $0.031 support and the $0.040 resistance level. A break below support could take this cryptocurrency down to the next levels of support at $0.027, $0.022 or lower.Conversely, a move above the resistance could take TRX all the way up to $0.049.On the 12-hour chart, TRON can be seen trading inside an ascending parallel channel. As it sits right below the middle line of the channel, a drop to the bottom could be forecasted where it could bounce off all the way to the top.If TRX breaks below the parallel channel, it could experience a decline in its market valuation.BitTorrentSince May 8, BitTorrent went up more than 200 percent in just 20 days reaching a high of $0.00186.Following the parabolic move, the TD Sequential Indicator is also predicting a retrace for this cryptocurrency based on the 3-day chart. A sell signal has been given by the technical index with a green nine that is currently trading below the 7-three-day moving average.Now, a drop down to the 30-three-day MA could be expected, but if BTT is able to trade above the recent high of $0.00186 the bearish signal will get invalidated.On the 1-day chart, it can be seen how BitTorrent pulled back to the $0.00127 support level after the recent bullish impulse. If this support point is not able to hold the price of BTT, the probabilities for a further decline to $0.00100 will increase.Nonetheless, if volume starts picking up BTT could rebound from around the current price point to try to make a higher high.A range of moving averages on the 12-hour chart could better predict the price action that BitTorrent will have in the upcoming days.At the moment, this cryptocurrency is trading below the 30-twelve-hour moving average and could find support around the 50-twelve-hour moving average. If the later is not able to hold, then BTT could plummet to the 100 or 200-twelve-hour MA.The bullish trend will continue only if BitTorrent is able to climb on top of the 7-twelve-hour moving average.Overall SentimentThe recent surge that TRON and BitTorrent went through was so strong and fast that an exhaustion point was needed for a healthy continuation of the bullish trend. Now, these two cryptocurrencies seem to be retracing and the 3-day chart predicts a further drop for both of them. Although Justin Sun might be able to pump the coins by continuing to make announcements about announcements, technically, TRX and BTT may be due for a pullback.Posted In: Tron, Altcoins, Technical Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

279,CryptoSlate,"Top 5 altcoins: Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS technical analysis",Ali Martinez,1559528160.0,"Even though bitcoin seems to be poised to pullback on a weekly scale, some of the altcoins could enjoy a spike in their volume taking them to new yearly highs.EthereumSince ethereum hit a low of $80 in Dec. 14, 2018, it has gone through a bull rally that has taken its market valuation up more than 250 percent, to reach a high of $289 on May 30.During the last few weeks, ETH has been trading inside an ascending parallel channel on the 3-day chart. Now that ethereum is sitting on the bottom of the channel, there could be a chance that it will break it down. A break below the channel could initiate a correction that could see this cryptocurrency’s price drop 25 percent.A move below the $250 support level could be used as the first sign of confirmation for a potential pullback and the probabilities will increase if the $234 support level is broken.Nonetheless, the bullish trend could continue if ethereum is able to trade above $271. A move above resistance could take ETH to test the high of $288 or the top of the parallel channel.On the 1-day chart, ethereum continues to trade inside a $37 no-trade zone between $271 and $234. Now that it has reached $271 and moved below the 7-day moving average, a drop to $234 could be expected, which is also where the 30-day moving average is sitting. If the 30-day MA is not able to hold ETH’s market valuation it could continue falling and find support around the 50-day MA.The ascending parallel channel previously mentioned can be better seen on the 12-hour chart. Recently, ethereum dropped from the top of the channel all the way to the bottom where it could bounce off to the middle of the channel.Now, it seems like a new fall to the bottom of the channel could possibly take ETH to test the 50-twelve-hour moving average. A drop below the 50-twelve-hour MA could drop ethereum down to test the 100-twelve-hour MA and if sell pressure is significant enough it could even test the 200-twelve-hour MA.XRPThe bullish momentum XRP experienced has been rejected by the $0.45 resistance level multiple times as it can be seen on the 3-day chart. The higher the times a resistance point is tested, the weaker it becomes. A move above $0.45 could take XRP up to the next level of resistance sitting at $0.56.Conversely, if XRP fails to break above resistance a move down to the $0.4-$0.37 trading range or even lower could be expected.The Bollinger Bands have begun contracting on the 1-day chart indicating that a period of low volatility could come soon. XRP could still test the upper band, drop to the middle band (20-day MA) or even the lower band.Even though a bullish impulse above $0.48 could take XRP to the new yearly highs, a pullback to $0.36 is possible.Since Dec. 2018, XRP can be seen trading in a parallel range in the 12-hour chart. Now that it has been trading around the top of the channel a retrace to the middle line, which sits around $0.37, could happen at any minute.A break out of the parallel channel could take this cryptocurrency to new yearly highs in an extremely bullish movement due to the length of the channel. The $0.48 level is a very important price point to watch.Bitcoin CashBitcoin cash has gone up more than 550 percent since it reached a low of $73 in Dec. 15, 2018.At the moment, BCH is trading around $430 and testing a significant resistance level that it has not been able to break for the last couple of weeks. A break above this price zone could take this cryptocurrency up to the next resistance level around $570. Failing to break above this resistance point could take bitcoin cash down to $355 based on the 3-day chart.On the 1-day chart, the Bollinger Bands appear to be contracting. At the moment, BCH sits right on the middle band or 20-day moving average. From now on, it could either fall down to the lower band or rise up to the upper band. A break above $483 could take bitcoin cash could indicate that a strong bullish movement will come.An ascending parallel channel can be spotted on BCH’s 12-hour chart. Bitcoin cash is currently trading on the bottom of the channel, which if it is able to hold could bounce off its market valuation to the middle or the top of the channel.However, if BCH is able to break the channel to the downside, the likelihood of a drop to the 50-twelve-hour MA or the 100-twelve-hour MA increases.LitecoinAs litecoin’s halving approaches, it continues a steady increase in its market valuation that started on Dec. 2018 and has seen it go up more than 440 percent.On the 3-day chart, LTC has been trading inside a massive ascending parallel channel. At the moment, this cryptocurrency is at the middle line of the channel and it could continue to rise to the top around $150.However, if litecoin moves below the middle line, it could go down to the bottom of the ascending parallel channel around $95.Since the beginning of the year, litecoin can be seen trading above the 50-twelve-hour moving average. The bullish trend will remain as long as LTC continues trading above this moving average, but a correction could be seen if it moves below it. The next levels of support are given by the 100-twelve-hour MA sitting at $75 and the 200-twelve-hour MA at $55.For the bullish trend to continue litecoin must also trade above $122 to make new yearly highs.EOSEOS has recently moved down to the number six spot in market capitalization once again after investors appeared to be taking profits following the Block.one announcement of an EOS-powered social network.This cryptocurrency can be seen trading inside an ascending parallel channel on the 3-day chart since Dec. 18, 2018, after reaching a low of $1.55. Currently, EOS is sitting right on the middle line of the channel, where a move further down to the bottom or a spike up to the top could be presumed.On the 1-day chart, a series of support and resistance points based on historical data can be drawn to predict the price points that will act as barriers in a bearish or bullish move.EOS is trading between the $6.95 support and $7.70 resistance levels. A break below this zone could take this cryptocurrency down to $6.45 while a bullish impulse could take it up to $8.70.Overall SentimentBased on this technical analysis of the top altcoins by market capitalization, a correction could come at any minute. Although bitcoin cash and XRP have been trading around significant points of resistance for an extended period of time and a break out could take them to significant new yearly highs, the rest of the cryptocurrencies seem like they could be about to pullback.Posted In: Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

280,CryptoSlate,Chainlink announces the launch of its mainnet on Ethereum,Priyeshu Garg,1559387760.0,"Chainlink, a decentralized oracle service, announced the launch of its mainnet on the Ethereum network. The company is working towards achieving real-time information validation in smart contracts, saying it will have an “immense” potential for adoption in various industries.Chainlink goes live on EthereumChainlink, an interoperability-focused company that aims to solve the connectivity problem in smart contracts, has quietly been developing its latest project. According to the company’s official blog post, the Chainlink network is now live on Ethereum.The move will enable the creation of a decentralized oracle network run by multiple independent node operators—something the company has been working on for more than a year. Chainlink said that the mainnet launch followed the successful completion of three independent security audits, as well as the completion of various internal scalability and stress tests.While the launch was hinted at earlier this year, a clear increase in demand for reliable decentralized oracle mechanisms was what led to the Ethereum mainnet launch.Chainlink’s oracle solves the problem of trusted third partiesPut simply, oracles are the connection between blockchains and the real world and are used to feed real-world and real-time data into smart contracts. The concept itself is nothing new, but Chainlink’s implementation is—the company’s mechanism supports Ethereum, Bitcoin, Hyperledger, and every other major blockchain.Sergey Nazarov, the Chainlink community leader and SmartContract.com chief executive officer, explained Chainlink’s approach to solving the problem of a “single trusted third party” in blockchains. He said that the company used decentralized computation to secure smart contracts. He explained:“The Chainlink network allows multiple independent nodes to perform decentralized computations about the accuracy of an external input before it is written into a smart contract.”According to the company’s announcement, some of the first oracle networks on Ethereum will be focused on retrieving market prices and feeding them into smart contracts, e.g. the ETH-USD conversion rate.The company also noted that they will have an onboarding process to list endorsed Chainlink nodes in the official documentation of the project. Other third parties will also be able to run Chainlink nodes themselves, as the project’s code is open source.

281,CryptoSlate,"Up, down, or sideways? Ethereum Classic, Ontology, OmiseGo, Augur, 0x technical analysis",Ali Martinez,1559260800.0,"Yesterday’s wild price action—where bitcoin saw its value jump above $9,000 to then quickly drop to $8,000—has the market wondering whether the bullish trend will continue or if it is time for a correction. Even though it seems like it is time to stay off the market, technical analysis of some of the most prominent altcoins could indicate otherwise.Ethereum ClassicSince Feb. 6 ethereum classic has experienced a steady increase in its market valuation to reach a high of $8.9 on May 30, which represents a 141 percent gain from a low of $3.7.On the 3-day chart, a spinning top candlestick formed indicating that a correction may come. If ETC retraces, it could try to test the $7.2 level, the support trendline or even the major support given by the $5.6 price point.However, if the $8 support level where ETC is trading now is able to hold its price, it could continue to rise and try to test the $10 resistance level.A spinning top candlestick can also be seen on the 1-day chart predicting a pullback that could take ETC to $7.2. The bearish pattern will be invalidated if this cryptocurrency is able to trade above the recent high of $8.9.A bearish engulfing candlestick formed on the 12-hour chart. At the moment, ethereum classic is trading above the 7 MA which is a bullish sign, but if the bearish formation is validated this cryptocurrency could go down to test the 30 or 50 MA. It will be wiser to wait for a move above the previous high before entering a bullish trade.OntologyFor over two months ontology has been consolidating between $1.6 and $1.0. During this time span, ONT has not been able to make a strong move out of this range.Currently, this cryptocurrency is trading around the $1.6 resistance level signaling that it could drop to the $1.0 support once again. If volume starts picking up, however, ONT could experience a bullish impulse that takes it all the way up to $2.8, which is where the next point of resistance sits.A double top formation seems to be developing on the 1-day chart. This is a bearish pattern that predicts an upcoming pullback. It validates what can be seen on the 3-day chart, in the sense that ONT could be about to go back down to $1.0 as it has been doing every time it reaches $1.6 for the last two months.A move higher could only be expected if ontology is able to trade above the recent high of $1.72.The TD Sequential Indicator gave a sell signal with a green nine on the 12-hour chart. A bearish movement to the $1.28 support level seen on this timeframe could be expected, but if the sell volume is high enough ONT could continue to go down to $1.15 or $1.0.OmiseGoBased on the 3-day chart, the market valuation of OmiseGo has been squeezing between the 7 and 100 moving average. A break above the 100 MA could take this cryptocurrency all the way up to the 200 MA, which is currently sitting around $7.Nonetheless, if OMG trades below the 7 MA it could drop down to the 50 MA at around $1.7.A trading range between $2.5 and $1.5 can be drawn on the 1-day chart with the $1.85 price point acting as the middle support zone. Now that OmiseGo reached the top of the range where it has been trading for over a month, it could be expected that it will go down to test the $1.85 support level.A break below support could take OMG to the bottom of the trading range, while a break above $2.5 could take it to $3.An ascending parallel channel is visible on the 12-hour chart. At the moment, OmiseGo sits on the middle of the channel indicating three possible outcomes. OMG could continue consolidating around this price point, it could fall to the bottom of the channel or it could rise to the top of the channel.AugurAfter reaching a low of $5.4 on Dec. 15, 2018, augur has gone up more than 370 percent to reach a yearly high of $25.7 on May 16.Now, REP retraced to $19 and has been trading below the 7-three-day moving average, which is a bearish sign. So far, the 30 MA seems to be holding its price from a further drop, but if it is no longer able to hold augur could fall down to the 50 MA, which sits at $17.On the 1-day chart, it can be seen how augur was trading above the 50-day moving average since early March, but on May 21 it moved below it. At the moment, it seems like this cryptocurrency could be on its way down to the 100-day MA or even the 200-day MA, sitting at $18 and $14 respectively.If REP is able to trade above the 50-day MA once again, it could continue its bullish trend taking it to new yearly highs.The Bollinger Bands appear to be squeezing on the 12-hour chart indicating a period of low volatility before a breakout is triggered. The levels watch out for are whether augur will move up past $21.4 resistance or drop below $18.6 support. A break above resistance could take this cryptocurrency to new yearly highs, while a move below support could prolong the correction that is currently underway.0x0x has had distinct price action this year. It appears to trade within a price range for a while before moving up to another price range. From late January until late March it traded between $0.27 and $0.23 following a breakout that has it now trading between $0.36 and $0.27 since the beginning of April.A move above this trading range could take ZRX to $0.45, where it could consolidate before a higher move, but a break move below could take it back to $0.23.A head-and-shoulder formation seems to be developing on ZRX’s 1-day chart. This is a bullish pattern that predicts a 40 percent move up upon the break of the neckline.A move above $0.36 will validate this pattern, while a drop below $0.27, which is where the right shoulder sits, will invalidate it.Overall SentimentThe market is going through a corrective period following the recent bullish impulse. Although it seems like there is potential for a further drop, this pullback could be part of a healthy continuation of the bullish trend. The different support points will determine whether the market will make new yearly highs or if it is on its way down to new lows. Posted In: Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

The exchange said that its #UseBNB initiative will further increase this number, as more and more platforms are being launched on Binance Chain.There are now 83 different places where you can use BNBBinance Coin (BNB), one of the best performing tokens in 2019, has seen both its value and its use cases increase by 50 percent in the past month. According to an official announcement from Binance, there are currently 83 different use cases for storing, using, and spending BNB.The management at Binance explained that there were around 55 use cases in March, the last time the exchange issued such an announcement, which means that their number increased by more than 50 percent in just over a month.In an official blog post, Binance noted that 28 more legitimate use cases for BNB have been added to the list. A very large percentage of the growth in use cases for the utility token was attributed to the launch of Binance Chain, the exchange’s own blockchain platform that features a decentralized exchange.#BinanceChain carving out its own territory. https://t.co/xvisOCWuum— CZ Binance (@cz_binance) May 29, 2019Since the Binance Chain went live at the end of April, there have been dozens of crypto projects that have expressed an interest in releasing new tokens on the “high-performance blockchain,” Binance said.The exchange claims that there are currently at least 24 different projects “publicly declaring” that they will be launching their crypto tokens on Binance Chain.

During this time, it traded within a $21 range between $112 and $133. A bullish impulse allowed DASH to break above this range and surge all the way up to $177.On the 3-day chart, dash found resistance around $172 and has not been able to move higher than this level. If it is able to break above it, dash could go up to the next resistance point around $210. Failing to trade higher than $172 could take dash down to find support at $153 or $133.Source: TradingViewDash can be seen trading above the 7-day MA on the 1-day chart, which is a bullish sign. If it continues to trade on top of this moving average the bullish trend will continue.A break below the 7-day MA could take dash to test the 30 or 50-day MA, between $145 and $135.There is a bearish engulfing pattern developing on the 12-hour chart on the upper Bollinger Band, which is a bearish sign. A drop to the middle (21 MA) or lower band could be expected based on this timeframe. The bearish formation will be invalidated if dash trades higher than $176.CosmosCosmos was released into the market in late April so there is not enough data for a long-term analysis. However, based on the 4-hour chart and the 1-hour chart a short-term forecast for this cryptocurrency is possible.A bull flag could be forming on ATOM’s 4-hour chart. The bullish pattern predicts a 22 percent move to the upside once the flag is broken, which is given by the length of the flagpole.Nonetheless, the bull flag will be invalidated if Cosmos moves below $5.2.On the 1-hour chart, after reaching the upper Bollinger Band, Cosmos retraced to the middle band and bounced off. Now that the price is moving up once again and a double top could be expected that could retrace the market valuation of ATOM to $5.4 or $4.8.However, if this cryptocurrency is able to break above $6.6 the bullish trend could get stronger pushing it to higher highs.NEMAfter a bullish engulfing candlestick formed around $0.047, NEM jumped and reached the $0.1 resistance level. A move above this level could take it up to $0.12 or $0.15 based on the 3-day chart.To the downside, XEM could find support between $0.08 and $0.072 or continue falling down to $0.056.A double top could be forming on the 1-day chart. This is considered a bearish reversal pattern that developed after NEM reached a high of $0.1 two consecutive times. A pullback to the 50-day moving average could be expected, but if the bearish trend is strong XEM could go down to the 200 or 100-day moving average.The bearish pattern will be invalidated if NEM trades higher than the most recent high of $0.123.On the 12-hour chart, the major resistance point is at $0.1. Since XEM has not been able to close above this level, a pullback to the 50-MA could be expected, which is sitting around $0.0.74.Nonetheless, if volume starts picking up and this cryptocurrency is able to break past resistance it could reach new yearly highs.Bitcoin DiamondIn the last two days, bitcoin diamond has moved up more than 80 percent, from $0.99 to $1.8 breaking past three levels of resistance. The significant surge that BCD experienced could make it retrace to $1.4 or $1.2 to consolidate before the bullish trend continues, based on the 3-day chart.An ascending triangle formation seems to have been developed on the 1-day chart. BCD was able to move higher than the 40 percent target given by the bullish pattern. Now, this cryptocurrency could find a trading range before its next major move.DigibyteDigibyte has been trading inside a massive ascending parallel channel since Dec. 2018, reaching higher highs and higher lows which is a bullish sign. Currently, this cryptocurrency is trading at the top of the channel so a move to the middle or bottom of the channel could be expected. The most likely retrace point could be $0.014. However, if DGB is able to break above the parallel channel it could experience a strong bullish impulse.The TD Sequential Indicator gave an unperfected green nine candlestick, which is a bearish signal. If validated, digibyte could go down to test the support trendline sitting at $0.012. The sell signal will be invalidated if there is a green two trading above a green one candlestick on the 1-day chart, which could take DGB to new yearly highs.On the 12-hour chart, digibyte can be seen trading below the 7-moving average signaling that a correction could be coming. If DGB continues to move down it could try to test the 30 or 50-MA, between $0.0145 and $0.013. Conversely, if this cryptocurrency is able to trade on top of the 7-MA once again, the bullish trend will continue.Overall SentimentThe market could undergo a sustained correction after the significant surge in prices that most cryptocurrencies have had. The retrace could be considered as a take profit period that has the potential to open the doors for a stronger bullish trend.It is worth noting that bitcoin went through a bull trap in 2015 that took its price down to test its previous low. This is a bearish pattern that tricks investors into believing that a new bullish trend has started when, in fact, after reaching a certain high the market goes back to test new lows.Posted In: Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

284,CryptoSlate,"Another copyright filed for Bitcoin whitepaper, mysterious figure challenges Craig Wright",Priyeshu Garg,1559183880.0,"Wei Liu, a Chinese citizen with a residence in California, filed a copyright claim to the Bitcoin Whitepaper with the U.S. Copyright Office. The mysterious figure is now a legal rival to Craig Wright, who claimed the same copyright last week.Chinese citizen also claims U.S. copyright for Bitcoin WhitepaperOne of the most controversial figures in the crypto industry, Craig Wright, saw his claims to the crypto throne challenged today when it was revealed that another person filed a copyright claim to the Bitcoin whitepaper.According to the official website of the U.S. Copyright Office, Wei Liu, a Chinese citizen currently residing in California, registered a claim on May 24—just three days after the news about Wright’s own registration broke. Liu claims to have published the Bitcoin whitepaper, titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” on January 11, 2008.It is still not clear who Wei Liu is, and no one has come through with a valid explanation of why the claim has been made at press time. However, as Wright’s copyright claim over the Bitcoin whitepaper was met with ridicule, it is reasonable to assume that Liu’s goal was to counter Wright’s claims.As the Copyright Office does not investigate the truth of any statements made in the registration claims, the claims themselves bear little legal weight. The latest development proves this point, as the links to Wright’s April 11 claims now say Liu holds the copyright to Bitcoin’s whitepaper.BSV pumps despite controversy around WrightHowever, despite the continuing controversy surrounding Craig Wright, Bitcoin SV is having its best month yet.

Although a correction could be expected at any moment, the bulls seem to have control over the entire cryptocurrency market.EthereumThe bullish impulse ethereum experienced has not ended after breaking above the ascending triangle that formed on the 3-day char. During the last two weeks, it has continued trending up in an ascending channel.Now the TD Sequential Indicator is giving a sell signal with a green nine on what appears to be a reversal candlestick. If the signal is validated, ethereum could correct for three to twelve days before a continuation of the bullish trend.The $282 resistance and $250 support levels represent important points when analyzing ETH. A break above resistance could take this cryptocurrency up to $350, while a break below support could take it down to around $190.Ethereum priceEthereum was trading within a $30 no-trade zone between $264 and $234 for eleven days. On May 27, it was able to break out of the range, but without enough volume for a higher move.If volume starts picking up and ETH remains trading above the 7-day moving average it could continue rising to test the $320 resistance level that can be seen on the 1-day chart.On the bearish side, a drop below the 7-day MA could take ethereum down to test the 30 or 50-day MA, which are sitting between $220 and $200.A bull pennant appears to have been formed on the 12-hour chart. Although ethereum has broken out of the pennant, the volume has not been significant enough to break above the previous high of $282 to make it reach $330, which is the target given by the bull pennant.Based on the 12-hour chart, it will be wiser to wait for a break above $282 or below $222 to enter a bullish or bearish trade.XRPThe trading range between $0.4 and $0.37 where XRP had been trading last week was broken to the upside and was immediately noticed by DonAlt, a cryptocurrency analyst.$XRPI hereby join & summon the XRP army.Support XRP on its way to glory.Make this thing moon by all that is holy, join the ranks of XRP.I think this is either the bottom or XRP goes much much lower.I'll buy here and I'll buy again in the next green zone if stopped out. pic.twitter.com/EEIdb1L8zt— DonAlt (@CryptoDonAlt) May 28, 2019Now that XRP has reached the $0.45 resistance level, it could take a while before it breaks it. A move above this resistance level could take XRP up to the next level of resistance sitting at $0.56.If XRP is not able to gain enough bullish momentum to continue rising, the first level of support will be given by the $0.4-$0.37 range.A bull flag broke out on XRP’s 1-day chart. This pattern projects a target of 33.5 percent to the upside, out of which 22 percent has already been reached. If the volume continues to pick up, XRP could rise up to $0.52 to reach the final target given by the flag.XRP can be seen trading in a parallel range since Dec. 2018. Now that it has reached the top of the channel two outcomes could be expected. XRP could retrace to the middle line of the channel, which sits around $0.37, or it could move above the channel.A break out of the parallel channel could take this cryptocurrency to new yearly highs in an extremely bullish movement due to the length of the channel. Thus, the $0.48 level is a very important price point to watch.Bitcoin CashAn ascending parallel channel has formed on bitcoin cash’s 3-day chart since the middle of March. Although it has been trading in an upward movement on the lower side of the channel, a break above the middle line could provide significant gains.Nonetheless, if BCH trades below the channel and the $356 support level, a drop down to $260 could be expected.Bitcoin cash has broken out of the $60 trading range between $420 and $360 where it was sitting for two weeks. A spike in volume could take BCH to the $630 resistance level based on the 1-day chart. Conversely, if this cryptocurrency moves below $420 it could go down to $360 once again.On the 12-hour chart, the Bollinger Bands can be seen squeezing indicating that a period of high volatility could come soon. Since BCH is trading around the upper band it could be expected that the next move will be bullish and it will try to reach the targets previously mentioned.EOSEOS has recently moved up to the number five spot in market capitalization pushing litecoin down as it prepares for an announcement in June, which according to Dan Larimer, the lead programmer of EOS, will be the “biggest news since [the launch of] EOSIO.”This cryptocurrency has been trading inside an ascending parallel channel since Dec. 18, 2018, after reaching a low of $1.55. Now that this cryptocurrency is trading at the top of the channel a sell signal has been given by the TD Sequential Indicator with a green nine.From this point, a move down to the middle line or the bottom of the parallel channel could be expected. If the correction does not come and EOS breaks above the channel, it could create enough bullish momentum for a significant move up.On the 1-day chart, EOS is trading around support. A continuation of the bullish trend could take it up to the $10 resistance level. However, a break below the $7.78 support level could take it down to $6.9 or $5.6.LitecoinSince Dec. 2018 litecoin has experienced a steady increase in its market valuation that could have been influenced by the upcoming block reward halving that is just 68 days away.LTC is currently sitting inside an ascending parallel channel just above the middle line and it could continue to rise to the top around $150. However, if it happens to move below the middle line, this crypto could go down to the bottom of the ascending parallel channel around $95 based on the 3-day chart.On the 12-hour chart, it can be seen how litecoin has been trading above the 50 moving average since the beginning of the year. The bullish trend will remain as long as LTC continues trading above this moving average, but a correction could be seen if it moves below it. The next levels of support are given by the 100 MA sitting at $75 and the 200 MA at $55.Overall SentimentThe top altcoins remain bullish as most of them continue to make new yearly highs. Although the TD Sequential Indicator is giving signs of a possible correction, the trend in increasing market valuation for these cryptocurrencies remains intact. It is possible that when the correction happens, it could be significant based on the bullishness of the trend. That said, the pullback may be needed for a healthy continuation of the upward movement.Posted In: Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

However, if the $0.35 support level breaks down this cryptocurrency may go back to $0.29 once again.There seems to be a head-and-shoulders pattern developing on the 1-day chart. This is a bearish formation that if validated could take Basic Attention Token down 33 percent to test the 200-day moving average, which is currently trading around $0.22. The head-and-shoulders pattern will be invalidated if BAT moves above $0.41 with high volume.On the 4-hour chart, Basic Attention Token has been trading between $0.34 and $0.39 since May 13. Although there have been certain spikes in the market valuation of this cryptocurrency that have taken it outside of the trading range, it appears to go back into it after a few hours. A break above or below this zone with significant volume will likely determine BAT’s direction for the days to come.DogecoinSince its inception, Dogecoin’s price action has been characterized by huge spikes. At the beginning of April, it saw a 100 percent increase in a matter of four days that took it from $0.002 to $0.004. Then, around May 11, it went up 47 percent in six days from $0.0025 to $0.0036.On the 3-day chart, the 200, 100, and 50 moving averages have been playing an important role in the latest market valuation movements that DOGE has experienced. Currently, this cryptocurrency has been fighting the resistance given by the 100 MA. If it is able to trade above this moving average it could try to test the 200 MA once again. However, if it is not able to break above the 100 MA, it could pull back to the 50 MA, which is sitting around $0.0024.On the 1-day chart, Dogecoin can be seen trading between $0.0028 support and $0.0036 resistance. A break below support could take DOGE to the $0.0024–$0.0022 accumulation zone, while a break above resistance could take it to test the $0.0046 level.The Bollinger Bands look like they are squeezing on the 4-hour chart. At the moment, Dogecoin is trading around the upper band so from now on it could either pull back to the middle line (21 MA) or continue rising. A clear trade will come once this crypto is able to break above $0.0031 or below $0.0028, which will determine the next move it will take.BitTorrentBitTorrent went through a steady decline in its market valuation since it was released, but after hitting a low of $0.0006 on May 8 it went up around 120 percent in a matter of thirteen days.The TD Sequential Indicator was able to call the bottom on the 3-day chart by giving a buy signal with a red nine candlestick that was later validated once a green two started trading above a green one. Now BTT is on a green six out of nine candlesticks, indicating that there is potential for another nine days of upside momentum.On the 1-day chart, it can be seen how BTT pulled back to the $0.001 support level after reaching a high of $0.0013 to quickly bounce off. Now BitTorrent has broken above resistance after testing the $0.0013 high. This crypto is making higher highs adding credibility to the bullish perspective seen in the 3-day chart.An ascending parallel channel developed on the 4-hour chart since the beginning of May. Now that BTT can be seen trading above the middle line of the parallel channel it could either pull back to the middle line or continue going up to the top of the channel. A break out of the parallel channel could spike up the market valuation of this cryptocurrency.RavencoinSince late March Ravencoin has been consolidating between the $0.044 support and $0.07 resistance level on the 3-day chart. A break above resistance will take RVN to new highs while a break below support could take it down to around $0.026, where the next level of support sits.The TD Sequential Indicator gave a buy signal on the 1-day chart with an aggressive thirteen on a reversal candlestick, which is a strong bullish signal. RVN is trading on a green two out of nine candlesticks, but a break above the $0.065 trendline could validate the bullish signal and take this cryptocurrency out of the consolidation zone to new highs.On the 4-hour chart, RVN can be seen trading above the 50 moving average once again after consolidating between the 50 and 100 moving average. If it is able to remain above the 50 MA the bullish trend will continue.Enjin CoinThere is not enough data to evaluate the long-term view of Enjin Coin.Based on the 12-hour chart, this cryptocurrency has been trading in an ascending parallel channel since May 12. Now that it is trading around the bottom of the channel three different outcomes could materialize: consolidate around the current price point, move up to the middle line or break below the channel.A break above the parallel channel could take ENJ to new all-time highs, while a break below could be the beginning of a correction in its market valuation.On the 4-hour chart, Enjin Coin is trading above the 7 MA, which is a bullish sign. If it remains trading above this moving average it could test the $0.18 resistance level and potentially break it to reach new highs.To the downside, ENJ will find strong support given by the 30 and 50 moving averages. If it breaks below these two moving averages it could indicate that a further pullback is coming.Overall SentimentIt seems like it is just a matter of time before the cryptocurrencies previously analyzed continue increasing their market valuation. At this point in time, the retrace might be over, but it would be wiser to wait for a break of the previous yearly highs before entering bullish positions once again.Posted In: Basic Attention Token, Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

The San Francisco-condo was sold for $1.6 million and is a testimony to blockchain’s growing popularity in real estate.Founder of TechCrunch closes sale on former CrunchFund HQ via blockchainBlockchain’s potential in the real estate industry has grown considerably throughout the years but has almost always been limited to high-profile, multi-million dollar mansions or commercial properties such as hotels.The sale of a condo that served as a headquarters to venture capital firm CrunchFund managed to slip through the media radar but nonetheless marks a very important step in real estate. According to the company’s founder, Michael Arrington, the San Francisco apartment was recently sold for $1.6 million via Propy.The blockchain-powered transaction platform received nothing but praise from Arrington, who is also the founder of online media outlet TechCrunch. In a May 23 tweet, he said that Propy’s platform was a “stellar product” that has become increasingly popular in the real estate industry.We completed the sale of the old CrunchFund condo in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago.

288,CryptoSlate,Coinbase lists MakerDAO stablecoin Dai on its retail platform,Mitchell Moos,1558608780.0,"Coinbase listed Maker’s stablecoin Dai on its retail trading platform. The move comes is part of a larger strategy to list more trading pairs to keep up with the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance.Coinbase attempting to regain market shareCoinbase has continued to aggressively list new crypto assets. Once considered the “conservative” crypto exchange stemming from the measured pace at which it added new coins, likely to adhere to more restrictive U.S. regulations, starting late last year the exchange changed its strategy to list a greater number of coins.The change in strategy is possibly a response to Coinbase’s weakening market position. In terms of percentage of total volume, U.S. exchanges including Coinbase are losing market share to the now dominant Binance.Details on DaiDai is the product of Maker, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that provides collateralized loans through a series of smart contracts and oracles, giving users access to credit without a centralized point of control.Users obtain these loans by locking their Ethereum in a smart contract. In return, users receive Dai, a stablecoin which represents a pool of all ether locked in the platform. Dai is soft-pegged to $1.00 based on the locked-up ETH. Users can then sell Dai for fiat or use it as leverage by trading it for more cryptocurrency.Unlike fiat-backed stablecoins, Dai maintains its peg through monetary policy conducted through the MakerDAO. The “stability fee,” or the annual APR of a loan is adjusted up or down to encourage borrowers to repay or take out loans. These actions increase or decrease the demand for Dai, allowing the DAO to theoretically maintain its $1 peg.Posted In: Coinbase, Altcoins, Exchanges, Stablecoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

289,CryptoSlate,Dragonchain awarded patent for blockchain-powered loyalty system,Mitchell Moos,1558353000.0,"Dragonchain, an enterprise blockchain-as-a-service provider originally developed out of a Disney technology incubator, was awarded a patent for a loyalty system that tracks and monetizes time on the blockchain, according to documents published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).The patent, titled security systems and methods based on cryptographic utility token inventory tenure, describes a new method for creating time-based value systems on a blockchain. The patent is a continuation of an application filed in November of 2018.According to the company, the system represents time-based scores using a value called the “Dragon Days of Slumber Score” (DDSS). The model shares some similarities with proof-of-elapsed-time based consensus (PoET), which is also used in some permissioned enterprise blockchains.DDSS has applications in digital assets and loyalty rewards by hardening a blockchain against tampering and gaming by bad actors, said Dragonchain. Joe Roets, founder and CEO of Dragonchain said:“When you look at existing loyalty programs, the rewards are not proportionate to someone’s actual loyalty. For example, airline rewards are often based on using a credit card to accumulate points, rather than rewarding the time someone has flown with an airline. By monetizing time with blockchain, DDSS creates a new type of value system to recognize true loyalty through immutable measurement.“The patent is the most recent addition to a “long list” of patents filed or received by Dragonchain. In November 2018, Dragonchain was awarded a patent for Interchain, which aims to allow users to conduct processing across public blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic.Related: Dragonchain to ‘Reimagine’ Blockchain with Launch of Seven New ProductsDragonchain’s push to patent its technology is part of a larger race among companies to stake intellectual property claims in the emerging field. Last week, StormX, another Seattle startup—was granted a patent for micropayment distributions.Meanwhile, multinational conglomerates such as Amazon, Mastercard, and Nike are making their own intellectual property claims.

290,CryptoSlate,"Analysis of active addresses: Bitcoin, XRP, Dash, and Dogecoin see major growth",Priyeshu Garg,1558171260.0,"A recent comparison from Coinmetrics showed that Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Dash, and Ripple have seen a significant increase in the number of active addresses. While these coins have performed very well this year, other solid performers such as NEO saw a 70 percent drop.Active addresses a good metric to measure coin popularitySource: CoinmetricsGetting a clear picture of the crypto market is a daunting task, as there are tens of thousands of variables to consider. Market capitalization has long been thought to be the best way to measure the popularity of a certain cryptocurrency and get a clear idea of where the market is going.However, looking at other data points can add additional insight in conjunction with market capitalization. For example, according to LongHash, one of the best ways to measure a coin’s popularity is to consider the number of active wallet addresses on its blockchain.Active addresses, meaning those that have engaged in crypto transactions during the past 24-hours, are a better metric than just the number of addresses, as it shows how much actual usage a coin actually gets.Ceteris Paribus, a well-known Twitter account focused on cryptoanalysis, compared the number of active addresses of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dash (DASH), NEO (NEO), and XRP (XRP).Crypto analyst compares the number of active addresses for top coinsThe tweet compared the 30-day average number of active addresses for each of these coins from May 14, 2018, to May 14, 2019.According to the data gathered from Coinmetrics, Bitcoin had 633,000 active addresses last year, followed by Ethereum’s 366,000. Litecoin came in third with 115,000, while Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash had 71,000 and 52,000, respectively.Dash, one of the most widely used coins in sanction-stricken countries such as Venezuela, had a 30-day average of just over 46,000 addresses, while Neo counted 11,000. Ripple, however, came in last, with just over 6,000 active addresses.Fast forward to May 14 this year, and Bitcoin is, unsurprisingly, still in the lead. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of active addresses on its network. Ethereum, with just 259,000 addresses, has seen a 29 percent decline this year.This drop was the most surprising of all the coins, as the sheer size of its network and the number of dApps built on it should have resulted in more active users. Litecoin also dropped 40 percent and only had 69,000 addresses this month.Dogecoin and Ripple saw a 27 and 38 percent increase, respectively, and were among the top five performers when it comes to network usage. Bitcoin Cash stayed approximately the same, reporting a drop of only 9 percent.NEO, the blockchain network dubbed “Chinese Ethereum,” saw the largest losses, with active addresses on the network dropping 70 percent from 11,000 in May 2018, to just 3,000 May this year.The cryptocurrency with the most activity on its network was Dash, which saw a massive spike in usage in Venezuela, where sanctions and inflation pushed people into using the fast and reliable Dash.

The platform was created by district0x, a network of decentralized marketplaces behind the DNT token, and will allow users to create, issue, and trade rare digital collectibles.Users can now trade “provably rare” digital collectibles on Meme FactoryThe digital collectibles industry has grown immensely since the launch of Crypto Kitties and is now a burgeoning niche within the crypto industry. A new blockchain-based marketplace went live this week, giving users another place to trade digital collectibles.Meme Factory, a marketplace created by District0x Network, launched today. The Ethereum-based platform will enable users to create and issue “provably rare” digital collectibles on a “truly decentralized marketplace,” the company said.Meme Factory will enable its users to create original memes that can be tokenized.

292,CryptoSlate,"Will privacy coins beat Bitcoin? Analysis of Monero, Zcash, Verge, Komodo, and Grin",Ali Martinez,1558065780.0,"The cryptocurrency market is going through a correction after the recent surge above $8,000. Yet, relative to BTC, will privacy coins fare any better? Using two indicators—support resistance levels and moving averages—it is possible to assess the outlook for Monero, Zcash, Verge, Komodo, and Grin.IndicatorsThe first technical attribute that will be used to analyze the mid-term future of the top anonymity coins is the support and resistance points. According to Investopedia, these are defined as a series of predetermined “price levels on charts that tend to act as barriers, preventing the price of an asset from getting pushed in a certain direction.”Support points are able to hold or pause the market valuation of an asset during a downtrend, due to the volume of buy orders. Conversely, resistance points contain the price of an asset from continuing to ascend during an uptrend because these can be seen as profit taking levels where the volume of sell orders are high.Additionally, the moving averages (MA), which are some of the most popular indicators, will help determine the short-term outcome of the cryptocurrencies in this analysis. A moving average is a trend line produced by looking at the average price of an asset over a specified period of time.MoneroOn the 1-day chart, Monero went through a consolidation period from Apr. 3 until May 10. During that time span, it was trading within a series of support and resistance levels between $73 and $62.After XMR broke out of that range, it went up to the next resistance point sitting at $78.6 which became support once it was breached. Then, it went up another 20 percent to try to break above the $94 resistance point, but it failed to do so and retraced to the  $78.6 support level.Now that XMR is sitting at support, a rebound could be expected from this area back to resistance. However, if this privacy coin is not able to gain enough bullish momentum to bounce off it could continue to fall down to the next support levels.On the 4-hour chart, it seems like the recent drop in monero’s market valuation was determined by the break of the 7 moving average. Although the 30 MA could not hold the price from falling further, it seems like the 50 MA could be acting as a support point. Breaking below the 50 moving average could take Monero down to test the 100 MA or the 200 MA, sitting at $74.5 and $71.5 respectively.To the upside, XMR could have a hard time breaking above $84 since that is where the 7 and 30 moving averages are crossing. But, if it is able to move above this level it could try to retest the $94 resistance level.ZCashThe $61 support level has been a key support point for ZCash. This level was able to hold its market valuation for almost a month until ZEC was able to gain bullish momentum and go up 28 percent. After it reached the $78 resistance level a bearish spinning top candle formed predicting a pullback, which indeed influenced a retrace to the $68 support level on the 1-day chart.If the $68 support level is able to hold, it could trigger a rebound to the $78 resistance level or even higher. Breaking below this zone could take this privacy cryptocurrency further down.On the 4-hour chart, the 30 moving average has been able to hold ZEC from descending even more after the 7 moving average failed to do so. A bullish engulfing candle formed around this zone predicting that ZCash could be about to bounce off.If this cryptocurrency is able to trade above the 7 MA once again, then it could be expected that it will try to test the $78 resistance level. However, if there is not enough buy pressure and ZEC breaks below the 30 MA it could find some level of support around the 50 MA.VergeOn the 1-day chart, Verge failed to break above the $0.011 resistance point. This was followed by a 19 percent pullback. If XVG’s market valuation continues to deflate it could try to test the $0.0084 support level. A further drop could take XVG down to $0.007, which represented a very strong support point that held this crypto’s price for over a month.Breaking below the 7 moving average created a massive drop in XVG’s market valuation that took it down to the 30 moving average. Around that zone, a reversal candle formed which could be signaling that Verge is about to rebound to the $0.011 resistance point. Only if, it can first break above the 7 moving average with high volume.KomodoKomodo has been trading between the $1.22 resistance level and the $1 support level for over a month. Although it has tried to break above and below those levels multiple times, it goes back to trade within this range. A spike in volume that can take KMD out of this trading zone remains to be seen.KMD can be seen trading above the 7 MA on the 4-hour chart, which is a bullish sign. If it remains trading above this moving average, it could try to go back up to test the $1.3 resistance level that can be seen on this chart.To the downside, it seems like the 100 and 200 MA are providing support for Komodo’s price but breaking below them could trigger lower lows.GrinThe hype around Grin seems to have faded as it has experienced a steady decline in its price since it was released into the market earlier this year. The selling pressure does not seem to be over as every time it is able to gain some bullishness the long-term bearish trend reasserts itself.On the 1-day chart, it is noticeable that grin must continue to trade above the $1.88 support zone, which is the lowest point it has reached so far. Breaking this level to the downside will get it to make new all-time lows.Nonetheless, this privacy coin is being supported by the $2 zone at the moment. If it is able to hold around this area it could go back up to the test the $2.34 resistance point or even higher if the volume picks up.On the 4-hour chart, it can be seen how the 30 moving average is the last barrier grin has before a drop down to the $1.88 support level. This moving average has been holding for over the past twenty hours and it could be getting weaker as time goes by. It remains to be seen whether bullish momentum that could take this cryptocurrency above the 7 moving average and potentially to test the $2.4 resistance level, given by this chart.Overall SentimentAfter going through the support and resistance points of the top privacy cryptocurrencies, it can be implied that a rebound could come soon for most of them. Bullish momentum could be starting to pick up in the near future allowing these coins to recover from the recent pullback.However, it will be worth paying attention to the support level of the digital assets mentioned above because a break below that level could push them further down.For more information, see our privacy coins sector page.Posted In: Monero, Zcash, Altcoins, Privacy, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

293,CryptoSlate,Roger Ver strikes back at Craig Wright for libel suit,Priyeshu Garg,1558058880.0,"The increasingly litigious Craig Wright sued Bitcoin Cash figurehead, and former business partner, Roger Ver for libel after being called a “fraud and a liar.” Ver responded to the lawsuit by seemingly debunking Wright’s claim that he controlled several high-profile Bitcoin addresses, which would have suggested that Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto.Craig Wright called out, againCraig Wright, one of the most controversial figures in the crypto industry, has been at the center of media scrutiny for a string of seemingly frivolous lawsuits. Now, the vocal founder of Bitcoin SV is in the news because it appears he was caught lying in court.Wright, who gained notoriety for claiming he is Satoshi Nakamoto, submitted a list of Bitcoin addresses to a U.S. District Court in Florida. These addresses are owned by him and a trust he operates.The addresses, which were described as a “lazy copy-paste job,” was supposed to prove that Wright owns some of the first Bitcoin addresses ever created.However, Wright’s nemesis and former partner, the similarly controversial Roger Ver, debunked his claims by using one of the listed addresses to create a signed message.$ bitcoin-cli verifymessage 16cou7Ht6WjTzuFyDBnht9hmvXytg6XdVT G39S6i4XsfQnixN5ePMjVPboWvGXdnW8xFFAXiwEriZFCclflbD7umP58u3Sl+dvvXC5BxBrRNkTMNf92O1UIXw= ""Address 16cou7Ht6WjTzuFyDBnht9hmvXytg6XdVT does not belong to Satoshi or to Craig Wright.Craig is a liar and a fraud.""— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) May 16, 2019Verifying the Signatures“Address 16cou7Ht6WjTzuFyDBnht9hmvXytg6XdVT does not belong to Satoshi or to Craig Wright.

295,CryptoSlate,"Has the uptrend changed for Stellar, Neo, Cardano, Tezos, and Qtum?",Ali Martinez,1557969900.0,"The latest altcoin technical analysis suggested that a correction was on the horizon following a market-wide surge. Now, it looks like the market is, in fact, retracing before there is a continuation of the bullish trend.StellarIn a matter of six days, Stellar moved up 58 percent to shape the right shoulder of the head-and-shoulders pattern that has been forming in the 3-day chart since December of last year. Now that XLM has broken above the neckline of the pattern, at $0.135, a 45 percent move to the upside could be expected to happen in the near future. This target was calculated by measuring the height from the neckline to the head of the formation.The head-and-shoulders pattern will be invalidated if XLM trades below the right shoulder at $0.089.On XLM’s 12-hour chart, a long-legged doji formed at the top of the bullish trend. This type of doji indicates that Stellar’s open price was virtually equal to the close price and it could be signaling a pullback.If the support level at $0.135 is broken to the downside, then XLM could retrace to the next level of support at $0.12.On the 4-hour chart, it seems like XLM could be trading inside a descending parallel channel. If it is able to trade below the middle line of the channel and the 7 moving average it could fall down to test the 30 moving average that is currently sitting at $0.115.Conversely, a break above the parallel channel could push Stellar’s market valuation higher.NEOSince early April, NEO was trading inside a descending parallel channel that took it as low as $8.41 on May 10. Three days later, it broke above the channel and it went up more than 40 percent. After hitting resistance at $13.7 it corrected by 17 percent.Now, NEO is trading between a strong resistance and support level. If it is able to break above $13.7 with high volume it could go up to test the next level of resistance at $15.7. However, if NEO fails to break above resistance a pullback to $10.5 could be expected.One of the most bullish technical patterns has been formed in NEO’s 1-day chart. A golden cross between the 100-day MA and 200-day MA took place around May 13. If NEO continues to trade above $8.5, the pattern will be validated and this cryptocurrency could be ready for a major bull run.A bearish engulfing candlestick pattern has developed on NEO’s 12-hour chart, signaling lower prices to come. A break below $11.6 could take this crypto to the 100 MA that currently sits at $10.7, and if broken it could try to test the support level given by the 200 MA at $9.8.If instead of breaking down NEO is able to trade above $12.7, the bearish engulfing candlestick pattern will be invalidated. It could then try to test the $13.7 resistance level once again.On the 4-hour chart, the TD Sequential Indicator gave a sell signal with a green 9 candlestick trading right at the $13.7 resistance level. The signal was validated once NEO broke below the 7 moving average. If the bearish movement continues, this crypto could try to go down to the 30 or 50 MA, sitting at $10.8 and $10.1 respectively.To the upside, breaking above the 7 MA could give NEO a boost to try to break above the $13.7 resistance level.QtumA double bottom pattern developed on Qtum’s 1-day chart. This is a technical formation that describes a trend reversal from bearish to bullish. QTUM has already reached the target given by the pattern as it approached the $3.6 resistance level. Now, this crypto is pulling back after the 48 percent jump it just experienced.The TD Sequential Indicator was able to call the top on the 4-hour chart, giving a sell signal with the green 9 candlestick. Now that Qtum has almost reached the $2.9 support level, it could be preparing to continue the bullish trend.CardanoCardano seems to be breaking out of a massive bull flag on the 3-day chart. This technical formation predicts a move up to $0.13, which is given by the height of the flagpole added to the breakout point.A bearish spinning top candlestick could be developing on Cardano’s 1-day chart. The pattern will be validated if the next daily candlestick closes below $0.083, which could take it to the $0.074 support level. However, a move above $0.1 could invalidate the bearish formation and ADA could rise to the $0.11 resistance level.On the 4-hour chart, the TD Sequential Indicator gave a sell signal. Although the price retraced around 11 percent, it quickly came back up. If ADA trades below the 7 MA, there could be a further drop that could find support around the 30 or 50 MA.If Cardano continues to trade above the 7 moving average, it could continue the bullish trend to try to test the resistance level at $0.11.TezosTezos has been experiencing a steady increase in its market valuation after it reached a low of $0.31 on Dec. 7, 2018. Since then, it has moved up around 500 percent.Now XTZ is trying to break above the $1.85 resistance level. If successful, it could try to test the next resistance level at $2.5. Conversely, if it breaks below the support level of $1.43, it could experience a further drop to $1.11.On the 4-hour chart, XTZ is trading below the 7 moving average, which is a bearish sign. A further drop could be expected, which could find support around the 30 or 50 MA. If any of these moving averages hold the drop, Tezos could rebound from any of these points of support.Overall SentimentFollowing the bullish momentum that most cryptocurrencies experienced, a pullback is needed as part of a healthy rising trend. As seen in the technical analysis above, from Stellar to Tezos, all the altcoins seem to be going through a corrective period before the continuation of the trend. Hopefully, the support levels will hold the market valuation of these cryptos followed by a bounce off to new local highs.Posted In: Cardano, Neo, Stellar, Tezos, Altcoins, Technical Analysis, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

After breaking—and monetarily holding—$8,000, other altcoins are getting some action. XRP recently saw a 40 percent increase, Ethereum is surging, and Binance coin is approaching all-time highs.Technical analysis suggests a major correction could happen at any moment. Nevertheless, there are indicators that the top three cryptos by market cap, in addition to Binance coin and IOTA, show promise.BitcoinBitcoin continues to make new highs after breaking above $6,450 on Apr. 12. So far, it went as high as $8,350, and now it could even try to test $9,500 resistance.The TD Sequential Indicator, created by Tom Demark, sets various numbers above and below the candlesticks on a chart that can be interpreted as bullish or bearish signals.A bullish signal is given when the indicators show a red nine candlestick and/or when a green two candlestick trades above the previous green one candle (shown below).Conversely, a bearish signal is given when there is a green nine candlestick or when a red two candle trades below the previous red one candlestick. The stop loss can be placed above the last high of the current bullish trend or the last low of the current bearish trend depending on if its a long or short trade.On the 1-day chart, bitcoin is currently on a green eight candlestick. A sell signal could be given on May 16 if, by that time, BTC is still trading above $6,980 as per the sequential indicator.A close below $7,600 could take it down to the next support line found at $6,800, but a break above $8,350 could take BTC to a new yearly high of $9,500.Source: TradingViewOn the 12-hour chart two different patterns are visible:A bullish pennant predicting a 13 percent target to the upside, which is given by adding the height of the flagpole to the top of the flag sitting around $8,080.A bearish reversal candlestick, which signals a potential pullback.Source: TradingViewOn the 4-hour chart, bitcoin seems to be trading inside an ascending parallel channel as the price has been showing areas of support and resistance that can be used to set stop-loss orders and profit targets.At the bottom of the channel, a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern formed, signaling that BTC could go back to the top of the channel. A breakout above the ascending channel will signal a continuation of the move higher, while a breakout below will indicate a possible trend change from bullish to bearish.Source: TradingViewEthereumAn ascending triangle has formed on the Ethereum 1-day chart as it breaks out. The target of this pattern can be calculated by taking the height of the triangle and adding it to the $160 breakout point.Source: TradingViewBased on the TD Sequential Indicator, a buy signal was given once a green two started trading above a green one candlestick on the 12-hour chart. The current candle is a green three validating the bullish perspective.The next resistance level is at $255, and if broken to the upside it could get ETH to try and test the next resistance point at around $290. Conversely, the support levels sit at $196 and $176.Source: TradingViewOn the 4-hour chart, ether has been rising, forming a channel, inside three ascending parallel lines.

297,CryptoSlate,Unikrn now allows users to bet crypto on top Fortnite streams on Twitch,Priyeshu Garg,1557814560.0,"Unikrn, one of the largest esports betting platforms in the world, has debuted a new product that allows fans to place crypto bets on Fortnite and Apex Legends streams on Twitch. While no partnerships with star gamers have been established, the company believe exposing the esports betting community to crypto will increase adoption.Esports betting platform debuts new online gambling featuresCryptocurrencies have been quick to penetrate almost every industry, and the world of online gambling is not an exception. However, as the industry matures, so do the needs of its customers.Unikrn, one of the most popular esports platforms in the world, has decided to tap into the increasing demand of its users to bet not just on top tier esports games, but on smaller tournaments around the world. The company has just debuted a new feature that allows its users to place crypto bets on streamers on Twitch and other similar platforms.Revenue from Fortnite Battle Royale during the first half of 2018 had been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars per month with total 2018 revenue estimated at $2.4 billion by analysis firm SuperData Research. (Source: Wikipedia)While Unikrn currently allows its users to bet on high-profile tournaments, the lack of events throughout the year means all bets are concentrated in the few days that such tournaments take place. To provide users with more content to bet on, the company introduced a new system that allows its users to bet on the outcomes of first-person-shooter games on streaming platforms.For now, the company will only enable betting on the “very best streams,” but could expand it to more streamers and games in the future. Andrew Vouris, the COO of Unikrn, said that their platform will “tap the potential of this unprecedented volume of competition-based entertainment,” and called streamers the “star athletes of a new generation.”How does the platform workAccording to Rahul Sood, the CEO of Unikrn, users will be able to open up live streams on platforms such as Twitch and bet on a variety of different things within the game – on whether or not the streamer will win, how long will the streamer survive, how many kills will he have, etc.The platform will use computer vision to follow the stream alongside the user and determine the outcome of the game. Unikrn’s software will also use the watch time to built up its book on that particular streamer and game, which will strengthen their overall position.Apart from enabling users to place their bets in crypto, Unikrn will also enable past-betting on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) matches. The company calls the product “Virtual Betting,” and will allow users to bet on individual matches within a professional CS:GO game. Therefore, even if a user knows the outcome of the entire game, they won’t be able to know the result of a match they’re seeing.It might take a while until Unikrn’s new gaming products rollout in the US. In most cases, the company will need to establish a partnership with a local casino in each state for their product to be approved,However, their Isle of Man gambling license will enable the company to operate in the rest of the world.Posted In: Adoption, Altcoins, Culture     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

298,CryptoSlate,Charles Hoskinson of Cardano partners with Polymath to launch security token blockchain,Mitchell Moos,1557733140.0,"Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, is partnering with Polymath as the co-architect of “Polymesh”—a blockchain that aims to become “layer one” for security tokens, as first reported by Forbes contributor Rachel Wolfson at Consensus 2019.According to Trevor Koverko, the co-founder of Polymath, Polymesh is a blockchain that is looking to change how companies issue securities and track equity. Koverko stated:“[Polymesh] is purpose-built, since security tokens have unique needs and characteristics that demand a specific foundation. Ultimately, we want to marry issuers, investors and regulators together, which is what the layer one architecture is designed to do.”Such a system comes at a desirable time. Utility tokens and other cryptocurrencies considered commodities, such as bitcoin, still fall into a regulatory gray space based on the lack of clear guidance from the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.However, the regulations around securities or equity are already established. Building such a system is more a matter of compliance around tokenization and the treatment of data rather than challenging the classification of these crypto-assets.Should Polymesh gain traction, it could serve as a more regulated alternative to fundraising via initial coin offering (ICO), which saw its peak in January of 2018. However, Hoskinson suggests Polymesh has its sights set on more than just the cryptocurrency markets: “There are quadrillions of dollars of financial securities, and building a blockchain to secure them is an incredibly exciting task.”Polymath currently operates on Ethereum but is working on deploying its own blockchain because of limitations (or lack thereof) of the network.Ethereum is engineered in such a way where it is intentionally difficult to censor transactions. As pointed out by Hoskinson, actions such as freezing or reversing a transaction are necessary for a functional system that manages securities. Koverko noted:“All the best features of Ethereum are actually bugs for security tokens. We see a coming stampede of security tokens, but it’s more complicated than the first wave of utility coins due to all the regulations, compliance issues, and data.”   Cardano 7 Nov at 2:21 am UTC$0.08  9.86%Cardano, currently ranked #10 by market cap, is up 9.86% over the past 24 hours.

299,CryptoSlate,"Altcoin outlook: ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, litecoin, EOS technical analysis",Ali Martinez,1557708300.0,"Over the last three weeks, Bitcoin decoupled from the overall crypto market, with the coin’s market cap over 60 percent. In fact, at the time of press, Bitcoin’s dominance is 60.15 percent. Yet, some traders expect major altcoins to begin breaking out to counteract the rise in BTC’s dominance. Technical analysis of the top five altcoins could give a glimpse of when the trend will shift.EthereumUp until now, ethereum has appreciated more than 150 percent since its low in Dec. 14, 2018, when it reached $80 following a precipitous drop from an all-time high of $1,400 on Jan. 13 of the same year.Now, there are two different patterns with contrasting outcomes forming on ethereum’s weekly chart. One outcome could indicate a continuation of the recent bullish trend while the other suggests a further drop in market valuation:There seems to be an ascending triangle developing, which could be at its breakout stage. Previously, ETH went through a fake breakout to then pull back into the triangle and now it appears to be breaking above it once again. The horizontal line at the top of the triangle was drawn along the swing highs, while the rising trend line was drawn along the swing lows. The target of this pattern can be calculated by taking the height of the triangle and adding it to the breakout point.Conversely, a rising wedge seems to be forming on the same chart. This is a bearish pattern that begins with a wide bottom and as prices increase it contracts and the trading range narrows. Once the support trendline breaks, a target can be measured by subtracting the height of the triangle from the breakdown point.View the TradingView chartOn the three-day chart, ether could be about to break the major resistance that it has encountered with the 100-three-day moving average, signaling higher prices. If it is able to break above it, the next resistance level will be determined by the 200-three-day MA, which is currently around $395, and the 100-three-day MA will become a support level. However, if ethereum is not able to breakout and instead falls in price, it could be held by the support trendline or by the 50-three-day MA that sits around $140.View the TradingView chartXRPSince the beginning of the year, XRP has staggered within a trading range without any major price movement. It seems like investors have lost interest in this cryptocurrency, even though it rose more than 64,000 percent in the bull market of 2017, from approximately $0.005 to $3.45.A massive head-and-shoulder (H&S) pattern has been forming on XRP’s weekly chart, which predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. According to Investopedia, this pattern is considered one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns.The H&S will be validated if XRP breaks below the “neckline” or support line at $0.28 with significant volume, but it will be invalidated if the price moves above the height of the right shoulder at around $0.78. The target can be calculated by measuring the height between the “head” and the “neckline” and subtracting it from the “neckline.”View the TradingView chartOn the three-day chart, XRP can be seen trading inside a parallel channel since Dec. 15, 2018. Every time it reaches the top of the channel it reverses to test the bottom of the channel and vice versa.Now that XRP is trading on the lower side of the parallel channel, it could be expected to move up to the middle or upper side of the channel based on its recent price action. A break above the top of the resistance line could take XRP to new yearly highs while a break below the support line could take it to lower lows.View the TradingView chartBitcoin CashSince the first week of April, bitcoin cash has moved up around 130 percent. Even after seeing an exponential increase in its market valuation, it seems like there is more room for BCH to go up.On the weekly chart, a bull flag formed and now it seems to be at its breakout stage. A target is given by adding the height of the flagpole, which is around 52 percent, to the top of the flag sitting around $290. At the time of writing, bitcoin cash is trading at $352, which is very close to the ultimate target given by this pattern.View the TradingView chartThe resistance and support levels on the three-day chart indicate that BCH already broke a major resistance point that now has been converted into support, which was the $232 level. The next major resistance point is sitting at around $600. BCH would have to first trade above $400 to advance to the next resistance point.View the TradingView chartLitecoinLitecoin has experienced a steady increase in its market valuation since it reached a low of $22 on Dec. 14, 2018. Since then, it has appreciated more than 350 percent. After reaching a high of $100, it failed to break major resistance at $97, after which it pulled back to support at $67.5. LTC has now started inching up again in tandem with BTC.If LTC is able to break above the $97 resistance level, the next resistance level sits at around $150. Failing to break above the current level could take it back to the $67.5 support level or even the $50 support level.View the TradingView chartOn the three-day chart, litecoin can be seen trading inside an ascending parallel channel since Dec. 14, 2018. A fake breakout of the channel was triggered on Apr. 3, 2019, but it quickly returned to a trading range within the bottom of the parallel channel.After bouncing off the lower line of the channel, LTC seems to be fighting the resistance given by the middle line. If it is able to break above the line, then it could go as high as the upper line of the parallel channel. A breakout of this pattern could trigger higher highs, while a break below the channel could take it back to the support levels previously described.View the TradingView chartEOSEOS seems to have formed an Adam and Eve bottom from Dec. 2018 to Feb 2019. Following the break of the $2.90 resistance level, EOS has reached the $6 target given by the pattern.Based on the weekly chart, EOS has formed two consecutive golden crosses between the 7-week MA and the 30-week MA, and the other one between the 7-week MA and the 50-week MA. Investopedia describes a golden cross as one of the most effective patterns to predict an upcoming bull run.Ideally, the 30-week moving average should also cross above the 50-week moving average as an ultimate confirmation that the pattern has been validated.View the TradingView chartOn the three-day chart, EOS is trading between the 100-three-day MA—serving as support—and the 200-three-day MA, acting as resistance. A break above resistance could take EOS to higher highs, while a break below support could take it down to test the 50-three-day MA.View the TradingView chartOverall sentimentWhile bitcoin has risen over 130 percent since its December low, most altcoins have risen equally, or higher, during the same time span. A different number of indicators are predicting that the top altcoins could soon experience bullish momentum. XRP, however, could have a bearish future based on this technical analysis.Up until now, nearly all altcoins have lost value relative to bitcoin over the last month. If these cryptocurrencies are able to break the different resistance levels described above, it could trigger a rally that allows them to trade at more favorable rates against BTC.The overall sentiment of the market, as the charts indicate, is bullish. That said, given the rapid increase in prices, a correction in BTC prices could cause panic and erase newfound gains for the entire market over the short term.Disclaimer: None of the information above should be construed as investment advice.

300,CryptoSlate,Qtum blockchain allows digital property owners to truly own their assets through “Proof of Existence”,Omar Faridi,1557745680.0,"The developers of Qtum, a platform for building and deploying smart contract-enabled decentralized applications, have revealed that Robin8’s Profile Management Ecosystem (PMES) allows users to upload their intellectual property (IP) data to QTUM’s blockchain network.As explained in an official blog post, published on May 11th, 2019 from Qtum’s Medium account, influencers, subject-matter experts, inventors, artists, and digital property owners, in general, can “claim ownership” of their IP or digital assets by transferring and registering them on the QTUM blockchain.Users Can Truly Own Their Digital Assets And IPsAccording to Qtum’s developers, users may also trade their digital property on Robin8’s decentralized marketplace. The PMES has been designed to allow users to build an ecosystem, which is based on distributed autonomous ownership. Digital assets and IPs, which are part of the PMES, are “controlled by the community” members and not by a centralized entity.The developers described a new technology being used to address problems with timestamping:“Proof-of-Existence technology, through the onset of blockchain technology, has helped address this problem with provable timestamps of data.”Digital data residing within the PMES cannot be deleted or modified as all data records are tracked and verified using electronic timestamps. As noted by Qtum’s development team, users can upload and claim ownership of various types of digital assets including cryptocurrency tokens, e-books, software licenses, password keys, and social media profile data.Enormous “Market Opportunity” For PMES’ ServicesGiant social media networks make huge profits from user-generated content and ideas, Qtum’s blog stated. In order give control and ownership of their property back to the content creators, the PMES platform allows users to buy and sell their assets in a peer-to-peer (P2P) manner. PMES users can also post ads and interact directly with other users.According to the developers, the “market opportunity” for services offered by the PMES platform are enormous because large centralized platforms are not able to provide similar services. The blog post describes the PMES as “a hybrid Ebay and Facebook”, however, it’s completely decentralized and “autonomous.” Moreover, Robin8’s PMES users control their data and they can decide whether to sell or share it with other users.

301,CryptoSlate,Seattle startup StormX granted patent for micropayment distribution technology,Priyeshu Garg,1557659460.0,"StormX, a popular gamified microtask platform based in Seattle, has recently patented innovative micropayments technology that allows for better scalability by creating a hybrid solution of off and on chain transactions using bolts and Storm Token, the company said in a press release shared with CryptoSlate.Seattle-based startup looking to revolutionize micropaymentsStormX, Inc., the blockchain-powered adtech and gamified micro-task innovator, has recently patented an innovative micropayments technology that will allow the company to improve its rewards app.Founded in 2014, the Seattle-based company has taken a unique approach to enable users to earn cryptocurrency – completing simple tasks on their Storm Play application. The app offers tasks from companies such as Airbnb, Uber, Instacart, and NexonM, and has been downloaded millions of times on both iOS and Android.However, despite the app catching on fast, the company experienced issues when sending out payments to users, as the Bitcoin network it was based on had scaling issues. As a result, the company decided to migrate from Bitcoin to Ethereum in 2017 and enabled tokenization at the end of that year. StormX said it was able to do so by creating a hybrid solution of off and on chain transactions using bolts and Storm Token.While the hybrid solution allowed the company to process over a million transactions a month, issues with Ethereum’s scalability hindered the app’s full potential. Last year, company executives told CryptoSlate that it was exploring more ways to integrate Storm Play with distributed ledger technology (DLT).A data distribution system that frees up the Ethereum blockchainIn March 2018, StormX filed a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, detailing a new method of operating a data distribution system when dealing with a large number of participants.According to the patent filing, StormX’s proposed method includes several ways of configuring transistor-based circuitry to obtain off-chain batch evaluations. This allows the company to batch evaluations of all the tasks completed by its users in a way that enables faster and more efficient on-chain batch data distribution.Related: Storm Play Launches Long-Awaited iOS App for MicrotasksBy batching transactions on their app ledger bolts and sending out aggregated payments once a week, the company minimized its effect on the Ethereum blockchain. Notoriously prone to congestion, especially when a large number of smaller transactions are involved, the Ethereum network doesn’t have to deal with millions of daily microtransactions.Batching transactions didn’t only make payouts more efficient – it also made them available to virtually everyone across the world.Storm CEO Simon Yu said:“We’re excited the hard work into developing this technology was officially recognized by the US Patent Office. Since 2014, when we were able to send two-tenths of a penny to users half way across the world with minimal fees, we realized the potential of blockchain technology. As awesome as it was, the current blockchain solutions had not allowed micro payments to be efficient at scale and support our 2.5+ million users who have earned through our app. With this we can continue driving for mass user adoption and expand Gigs and the Storm ecosystem.”The USPTO officially published StormX’s participant-configurable batch content transfer patent on May 7th, adding to its list of innovative patents filed by crypto companies. The company plans on using the technology to grow its user base and provide better and more varied services that will create a whole new way of job advancement.    12 May at 12:27 am UTC$0.00  7.73%, currently ranked #223 by market cap, is up 7.73% over the past 24 hours.

The relationship is visible when looking at overall market capitalization excluding BTC, which has a direct relationship to the average performance of all altcoins.Source: TradingViewOverall market capitalization excluding bitcoin, from the May 7 to May 10, decreased by 9.4 percent from its peak to its localized low. This translates to across the board losses for altcoins.Meanwhile, since Apr. 26 bitcoin has seen “parabolic growth” going from $5,131 to trading at over $7,100 today.Source: TradingViewIt appears that bitcoin decoupled from the overall market and capital from altcoins flowed into the dominant cryptocurrency. Some even went as far as to call the relationship between bitcoin and altcoins a “massacre.”Source @CryptoScamHubExamining the relationship between bitcoin and altcoinsThe relationship between bitcoin and altcoins is cyclical according to Avi Felman, a trader at Wave Financial:4/ The bull run is started by Bitcoin posting strength.Next, a few alt coins (such as ETH and XRP in 2017) lead the charge up and shave off Bitcoin dominance.Then, at the peak of the bull will come the part called “altseason” where profit spills over into other altcoins.— Avi Felman (@AviFelman) May 10, 2019Felman points to historical data from the bull run of 2016 to 2017, where the cycle was observed twice. Gains in bitcoin are followed by major altcoins—such as litecoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, and XRP—and then by minor altcoins, such as chainlink, decred, and neo.This is observable by looking at bitcoin dominance relative to other cryptocurrencies. In January of 2016, the overall market capitalization was $615 million. By the end of December 2017, it was $373.6 billion. Much of these gains were accrued first to bitcoin and then by altcoins as seen in the chart below:Source: CoinMarketCapBitcoin went from dominance levels of over 60 percent before losing market capitalization to ethereum, XRP, and litecoin. This is also observable when cryptocurrencies respectively peaked during the 2017 bull market.Bitcoin peaked first on Dec. 17, reaching highs of $19,600. This was followed by litecoin on Dec. 19, reaching $375.Bitcoin cash peaked a day later, on Dec. 20, hitting $4,355. On Jan. 4, XRP went as high as $3.81. Finally, ethereum reached its height on Jan. 13 at $1,427.Is the pattern repeating?Now, the pattern may be repeating as bitcoin once again gains dominance. Relative to the total market capitalization of all cryptos, bitcoin has steadily risen to 59 percent market dominance, a 365-day high.As seen in the past, altcoins were losing value as bitcoin marched upwards in dominance. However, now these gains are starting to flow into altcoins as bitcoin accelerates past $7,000.Nevertheless, the crypto markets are still highly unpredictable. Even if historical data suggests these kinds of cycles exist, it would not be surprising for them to be broken.That said, there are a few likely scenarios. If bitcoin continues to post astronomical gains with limited capital inflow into the overall market, then altcoins may continue to perform poorly. If capital starts pouring into the market, then rising bitcoin prices will likely raise the value of all coins. If bitcoin surges and then consolidates, it’s possible altcoins will see delayed gains as Felman has suggested.

Tyler Jenks, a 40-years trading veteran, lost a 1 BTC bet he made on Mar. 4, 2019, against a technical analyst, who goes by the pseudonym fil₿fil₿. Jenks bet that bitcoin would trade below $1,500 before hitting $6,500.To be clear this bet is:If bitcoin trades > $6500 and does not trade below $1500 in advance of that (from today), I win the bet.If bitcoin trades < $1500 and does not trade above $6500 in advance of that (from today), Leah and lucid invest win.Exchange basis: Bitstamp.— fil₿fil₿ (@filbfilb) March 5, 2019Other analysts and influencers were able to spot what was happening to the market valuation of bitcoin as it started to leave altcoins behind.Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin Core developer, was able to see BTC diverge from all of the other cryptocurrencies as early as Apr. 23, 2019.This is the biggest evidence that the bear market is over.

(@maxkeiser) May 4, 2019Vinny Lingham, the co-founder and CEO of Civic, explained in a Twitter thread how important it was for bitcoin to decouple from the rest of the market to signal that the bear market was over.As early as Apr. 9, 2019, Lingham was making the argument that the market was based upon sentiment and not fundamentals since every time BTC rose the rest of the crypto market followed through without any deep-rooted reason. Lingham stated that the main indicator for a rational bull market will be set by bitcoin decoupling from other crypto assets.The key indicator for the start of a sustainable bull run is likely a decoupling of asset values from Bitcoin (i.e. Bitcoin’s strength weakens other networks or vice versa). Anything else is just speculation again (maybe we need another bubble to learn more lessons? 😉😂)…— Vinny Lingham (@VinnyLingham) April 10, 2019Since May 6, 2019,  bitcoin has consistently decoupled from the market compared to the top five altcoins by market capitalization. The pioneer cryptocurrency has had a steady increase in its market valuation leaving the other cryptocurrencies behind. A bullish impulse has been able to push BTC up more than 20 percent and easily break through the $6,450 resistance level.At the same time, the top five cryptocurrencies have been staggered within a price range without experiencing a bull run similar to bitcoin.Ethereum PriceEthereum quickly rose 13 percent to then dropped 10 percent by May 8 and now has been trading within a $10 range between $166 and $176XRP PriceXRP has been making new lows and now seems to be consolidating between $0.305 and $0.29.Bitcoin Cash PriceBitcoin Cash has been moving within a $17-range between $276 and $293.Litecoin PriceAlthough Litecoin has been making new highs since May 6, LTC’s trading patterns have diverged from the rest of the market. Out of the top five altcoins, LTC could be the one that decoupled first from bitcoin. After reaching a high of $99.90 on Apr. 3, it has seen a downward correction.EOS PriceEOS seems to be consolidating between $4.69 and $4.95, without any major move.Altcoin outlookAvi Felman, a technical analyst, believes that altcoins in fact are not dying and the current conditions are just part of the market cycle. Felman stated that during a bull market, altcoin prices increase dramatically but are often followed by long periods of indecision.Felman suggests that the best opportunity to accumulate is given during those times where it seems like the lower market cap cryptos are “bleeding.” Although the exact time when altcoins are supposed to rise cannot be calculated, it certainly happens when no one expects it.6/ It’s difficult to time exactly when “alt-season” will appear, but know that the cycles are generally longer than expected and happen more swiftly than expected.

The news comes after days of fear, uncertainty, doubt, and a 58 percent drop in its DGTX token price over the past week.Last week, in a YouTube video, CEO Adam Todd said he was dissatisfied with the platform prototype he was presented with by the outsourced development team Spotware, based in Cyprus. Todd said the platform was far from viable in its current form and would be virtually unusable if released to its community of potential traders and investors.Yesterday, CEO Adam Todd responded to the community’s many questions… Addressing Spotware's wrongful claims, clearing up any suspicions over #Digitex’s behavior, and revealing our new partnership with #Ethereum-approved #SmartDec. Check out the recap! https://t.co/T0p8e4MyjQ— Digitex (@DigitexFutures) May 1, 2019In a video demonstration of the prototype, Todd showed how the platform lacked essential features such as the ability to adjust leverage or exit positions. He also pointed out several bugs, the lack of a spot price, and the lack of market volume information on the beta platform. Moreover, the platform would charge commissions on trades despite Digitex being positioned as a zero-fee platform.On Apr. 30, Todd hosted a live AMA to the Digitex community and announced that SmartDec, the company’s smart contract security audit firm, would be taking over the platform’s development going forward.The Russian team of software professionals has worked closely with members of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA), has regularly published academic papers on blockchain tech security, and won the main hackathon along with several sponsor prizes at the ETHParis event. As Todd said:“The lead developer who wants to work with us has won six out of seven Ethereum hackathons. SmartDec is extremely well thought of in the space and is working with multiple Ethereum scaling solutions, including Plasma and zkSNARKS. We really couldn’t be in better hands this time and we’re extremely excited to be working with them.”SmartDec’s software development efforts could save the platform which has a waiting list of 1.5 million potential users.

305,CryptoSlate,"Zerocoin exploit found, Zcoin attacked, other privacy coins at risk",Ali Martinez,1556449260.0,"The Zcoin team discovered a vulnerability in the cryptography of the Zerocoin protocol that allows an attacker to forge zero-knowledge proofs and create coins out of thin air. Coins using the protocol such as Veil are vulnerable to attack until Zerocoin is disabled. Although the exposed flaw is fixable, the Zcoin team does not plan to allocate resources to the issue and instead will continue to focus on transitioning to its new privacy protocol, Sigma.Cryptographic FlawsOn Apr. 9, 2019, the XZC team was alerted to a series of irregularities in the mint and spend patterns of 100 tokens. They immediately contacted all pools, exchanges, and projects that utilize the protocol to disable Zerocoin while a deep investigation took place. By Apr. 19, the root cause of the issue was found and on Apr. 24 an emergency update was released.During the investigation, the team was able to uncover that the vulnerability was not the result of a coding error but was actually a cryptographic flaw in one of the zero-knowledge proofs that had existed since the inception of the Zerocoin protocol.Zerocoin works by allowing people to burn their coins (mint) and then redeem them later (spend) for new coins with no previous transaction history by producing a zero-knowledge proof that proves that they burnt the coins without showing which coins they burnt. To prevent people from reusing the same zero-knowledge proof to redeem new coins, each Zerocoin mint when spent will yield a unique serial number.The flaw, however, allows an attacker to reuse a single mint to generate many spends with unique serial numbers, which mean that the attacker can create new coins out of thin air and inflate the cryptocurrency as they wish.According to Zcoin’s disclosure, coins have been forged out of thin air—representing roughly 1 percent of Zcoin’s circulating supply. Coins which have something called the “masternode sporks” feature can turn off Zerocoin immediately, protecting themselves from attack. However, projects without the feature would need to hard fork to disable Zerocoin. Furthermore, coins that disable Zerocoin may compromise the privacy of subsequent transactions until a new privacy protocol is implemented.Is Zerocoin dead?CryptoSlate reached out to Reuben Yap, the COO of Zcoin, to know if there was a plan to solve the issues that the project is facing, to which he stated:“Declaring Zerocoin is dead is premature. There are probably ways to fix it and we are already floating some ideas with other teams. The only reason why we won’t dedicate resources to it is because we are transitioning out already anyway in line with our long term road map.”The company has spent most of 2018 working on replacing Zerocoin with Sigma, which is a precursor to their next generation privacy protocol named Lelantus that will expand its functionalities and privacy features during the minting and spending process. The new protocol makes it easier to be audited and will bring down proof sizes from 25 KB to 1.5KB. Sigma is in the final stages of development and is planned to be released on mainnet within the next two months.Mr. Yap also addressed the concerns about why Zerocoin was used when the original library had warnings on it not to be used in production.“The Zerocoin protocol and library have not been at a standstill and both the library and protocol in live use today have been consistently hardened and improved from the original. Since its inception in 2013, there have been at least 499 academic citations and even a paper that was published on discovered flaws and ways to fix them. Despite all the scrutiny from scholarly circles, it took this incident for this issue to be highlighted. This shows that it had nothing to do with coding errors in the library but instead, a result of a fundamental flaw in one of the cryptographic building blocks of Zerocoin, which is much harder to find.”Reuben insisted that they are still collaborating and working together with other projects to solve these vulnerabilities, but even prior to the incident they were already in the final stages of transitioning out from Zerocoin.It is unknown what will happen to other cryptocurrencies that use the Zerocoin protocol since they are still vulnerable to attacks and it is not trivial to switch to another protocol. Zcoin has yet to disclose the specifics of the cryptographic flaw because it could potentially elicit additional attacks on XZC and other projects using the protocol. For now, the team has contacted other projects using Zerocoin to give those projects time to secure themselves against the exploit.

307,CryptoSlate,"Five most prolific 51% attacks in crypto: Verge, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Gold, Feathercoin, Vertcoin",Elikem Attah,1556070600.0,"51% attacks are a cryptocurrency’s worst nightmare. These attacks destroy confidence in a project and emphasize the need for carefully designed proof-of-work consensus. Below is a list of the five most prolific 51% attacks in crypto.Understanding 51% AttacksA 51% attack can occur when an attacker gains control of more than 50% of a network’s hashrate (the total mining power used to validate transactions on the network). Once an attacker has 50% or more of the hashrate on a network, they can invalidate transactions and even double-spend coins—invalidating the immutability and trustworthiness of a blockchain.51% attacks are more expensive and difficult to execute on blockchains backed by more mining power. Simply put, it’s more expensive to control half of a network with more hashrate. For instance, crypto51.com estimates that it would cost $380,000 to carry out a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network for an hour. Conversely, only $8,100 is needed to attack Bitcoin SV in the same time period. Currently, Bitcoin has a hashrate of 38,000 PH/s compared to BSV’s 860 PH/s.Mining centralization is also a factor as a mining pool with more than 50% of a blockchain’s hashrate can also carry out a 51% attack. For instance, concerns were raised when the BTC.TOP mining pool controlled as much as 50.2% of the Bitcoin Cash hashrate at a point in January 2019.Coins that Suffered AttacksFeathercoin (FTC), Vertcoin (VTC), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Verge (XVG) have all suffered 51% attacks. All of the listed cryptocurrencies have relatively low hashrates relative to the total amount of available hashrate within their algorithm family, which made them susceptible to attack.The chart below compares the hashrates of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Vertcoin and Bitcoin Gold over the past year. Bitcoin’s higher hashrate makes it less prone to a 51% attack.Source: BitInfoCharts5. FeathercoinFeathercoin is a Litecoin clone that shares its 2.5 minute block time and the scrypt mining algorithm. The altcoin is currently ranked 461st on the list of cryptocurrencies on coinmarketcap.com. Feathercoin barely receives any notice today but was a top cryptocurrency around the time it suffered a 51% attack.Source: CoinMarketCapThe Jun. 8th attack on the Feathercoin network started with a marked increase in the network’s hashrate. It was suspected that the additional mining power came from miners on scrypt-based pools. According to the founder of Feathercoin, the miners were looking to benefit from the increased profitability on mining Feathercoin due to a change in difficulty.A total of 80 blocks were orphaned in the initial attack. Orphaned blocks are valid blocks on a network that are later replaced because a longer chain with greater proof-of-work takes precedence. This means confirmed FTC transactions were reversed in the attack. Some miners also ended up wasting effort on mining blocks that were eventually replaced on the chain.The problem was compounded when the official Feathercoin website suffered a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack around the same time.According to Tradeblock, exchanges had to increase Feathercoin confirmation requirements to ensure that only valid transactions on the right chain were processed. The advanced checkpointing (ACP) feature was also introduced by the Feathercoin team to prevent future 51% attacks. However, the attack still devastated confidence in FTC and it has since fallen into obscurity.4. Bitcoin GoldBitcoin Gold was the second fork of Bitcoin when it went live in November 2017 (amidst a few technical issues that occurred pre-launch). Albeit being marketed as a cryptocurrency supporting decentralized mining through an ASIC-resistant mining algorithm, critics of the cryptocurrency called it a “cash grab.” Yet, most bitcoin holders were given free BCG coins relative to their holdings of Bitcoin, so most welcomed the “free money.”In a May 11th blog post, the Bitcoin Gold team made Bitcoin Gold (BTG) holders aware of attempts to attack the Bitcoin Gold network. Exchanges were also asked to guard against the attack since potential attackers were likely to profit by double spending coins in exchange transactions. The blog post was updated on the 24th of May to announce that a dreaded 51% attack occurred on the network between the 16th and the 19th of May 2018. The attack on Bitcoin Gold also involved rented hashpower from cloud mining services.Bitcoin Gold—already one of the worst performing cryptocurrencies in 2018—faced even more problems after the attack. Bittrex delisted BTG following the BTG team’s refusal to pay compensation of 12,372 BTG. Exchanges including Bittrex, Binance, Bithumb, Bitinka, and Bitfinex lost an estimated $18 million worth of coins due to the double spend attack. Bittrex blamed the Bitcoin Gold team for negligence and demanded compensation in order to keep the cryptocurrency listed.In response, the Bitcoin Gold team stated that 51% attacks are a known risk in the ecosystem. They added that the BTG organization was not responsible for the attack since it was not caused by flaws in the Bitcoin Gold blockchain or code. Additionally, the team cited warnings it gave prior to the attack as well as the assistance it gave exchanges for defending themselves.The BTG team also claimed that the network upgrade carried out in July 2018 will reduce the likelihood of another attack on the network. Bittrex ended up delisting the coin, along with several others. Bitcoin Gold still survived as the 27th most capitalized coins on CoinMarketCap.3. VertcoinThe 51% attack on the Vertcoin network occurred between October and December 2018. Coinmonks estimated that a total of $100,000 worth of coins were double spent by an attacker in eight reorganizations of the Vertcoin blockchain. A chain reorganization or reorg occurs when a miner with more than 50% of hashrate comes up with an alternative transaction history by creating an extension of any chain and eventually replaces the network’s transaction history.In the attack, transactions in some orphaned blocks were double spent in the eventually accepted transaction history. A total of 71,000 VTC ($50,000) were double spent. In the ensuing panic, the price per VTC decreased from $0.7 to $0.3 per coin.Gert-Jaap Glasbergen, a Vertcoin developer, attributed the attack to the availability of cloud mining services and the release of specialized mining hardware for Vertcoin. Cloud mining services like NiceHash made it easy for an attacker to rent mining power at lower costs (purchasing and installing mining hardware for the same purpose is more expensive).Vertcoin has since updated its mining algorithm to Lyra2REV3 in order to render specialized mining hardware ineffective for mining Vertcoin. There is also on-going development on Verthash, a new algorithm that will completely eliminate the use of specialized mining hardware on the Vertcoin network. The new Verthash algorithm is expected to tackle the problem of surges in hashrate due to rented GPUs. Vertcoin went from 138th in coin rankings in September of 2018 to 162nd today.2. Ethereum ClassicEthereum Classic is the original version of Ethereum that remained after the core team created a fork by reversing the infamous DAO Hack on the Ethereum network. Proponents of Ethereum Classic were in favor of maintaining an untampered transactions history. However, Ethereum Classic went on to become the less popular version.Cryptoslate extensively covered the $1.1 million dollar heist that occurred in the 51% attack on the Ethereum Classic blockchain. The incident was first reported by Coinbase in a Jan. 7th blog post. It was revealed that a total of 219,500 ETC worth $1.1 million were double spent in eleven reorganizations of the blockchain starting on Jan. 5th. Coinbase and Kraken promptly halted trading in Ethereum Classic as a result.The ETC price plummeted due to the attack but has since recovered. The chart below shows the ETC price from the day of the attack to date.Source: www.coinmarketcap.comFollowing the incident, the Ethereum Classic team blamed the attack on insufficient hashrate and the malicious “bad actor” miner identified as Private Pool 0x3ccc8f74. Once again the team decided to not reverse the attack. A list of steps to avoid future 51% attacks was also made public. This includes the creation of a monitoring and alert system to detect attacks faster. A proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm change to minimize NiceHash renting attacks was also proposed.1. Verge CurrencyIn an interview with CryptoSlate, Justin Sunerok, the founder of Verge described the cryptocurrency as “a privacy coin designed for everyday use.” The privacy coin uses five different mining algorithms. Miners of the cryptocurrency are obliged to use a different algorithm for each block to reduce the likelihood of a single entity controlling majority hashrate on the network. Interestingly, this multi-algorithm system was created as a fix for a previous attack suffered by the network in 2016.In April 2018, an attacker exploited a bug in the Verge code and made away with at least 20 million Verge (XVG) coins, worth approximately $170,000. As explained by Bitcointalk forum user ocminer, the bug allowed a malicious miner to submit mined blocks with false timestamps. The attacker then mined multiple blocks within one-second intervals exploiting one of the five mining algorithms.In an attempt to solve the problem, the Verge team executed a hard fork that created new problems with wallets. In spite of the fix, Verge suffered a similar attack a month later.In his CryptoSlate interview, Justin Sunerok mentioned that the series of attacks on the Verge network “did not affect confidence in the project.” He added that the Verge community was as vibrant as ever. Since April of 2018, Verge fell from 26th in the ranking to its current position at 50th.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis, Hacks, Mining, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

308,CryptoSlate,"Five major cryptocurrencies with a YTD return of over 200%—BNB, BAT, ENJ, RVN, CRO",Priyeshu Garg,1555931640.0,"With the cryptocurrency market now increasingly in the green, it seems that every coin in the market is a winner. There seem to be a few outliers when it comes to year-to-date gains. Read on for five major cryptocurrencies that have seen their prices surge more than 200 percent since the beginning of the year.April Brings Stability to Incredible Price Growth of Five Major CoinsWhile 2018 has been by far the worst year the cryptocurrency has ever seen, it seems that 2019 is bringing back the glory days of the market. The new year pushed the entire market in the green, adding value to cryptocurrencies few expected to perform.There have, of course, been certain small-cap coins which rose over 100,000 percent, but they weren’t the biggest surprises of the year. Those typically had suspect volume to market-cap ratios hinting at low liquidity or, worse yet, market manipulation.Out of the top 100 coins by market capitalization, the five that stood out are Binance Coin (BNB), Brave’s Basic Attention Token (BAT), Enjin Coin (ENJ), Ravencoin (RVN), and the Crypto.com Chain Token (CRO).The five experienced a year-to-date growth of over 200 percent, with Enjin being the highest-growing project with a 374 percent increase in value since Jan. 1st.A Diverse Group of Crypto Projects Outperform ExpectationsWhen it comes to high-cap coins, Binance’s own BNB dominated the market. Released in July 2017, the company’s ICO raised over $15 million making it among the highest-grossing offerings at the time. BNB‘s 310 percent year-to-date growth is attributed to the launch of Binance Chain, the exchange’s very own decentralized blockchain platform. Its speed and scalability have made it a direct competitor to Ethereum and its effect on the industry has been compared to the Coinbase effect of 2018.Brave Browser’s Basic Attention Token (BAT) has also seen a meteoric rise in value. The Browser’s integration with high-profile websites such as The Guardian, The Washington Post, and Vimeo have pushed the coin’s price from $0.12 in January to $0.42 at press time. According to data from CoinMarketCap, BAT is now the 22nd coin by market capitalization.Created in order to simplify blockchain gaming, Enjin offers a flexible and free platform for creating, integrating and scaling tokenized gaming assets. Its native Enjin Coin (ENJ) was built on Ethereum’s ERC20 protocol and has a market cap of $148.95 million. According to data from Coincodex, the coin’s value increased over 370 percent since its Jan. 1st point, making it one of the best-performing coins on major exchanges such as Binance.Following closely is Ravencoin (RVN) with year-to-date growth of 365 percent. The open-source, Bitcoin-based project saw a 122 percent price increase in the first week of March. Many have attributed its growth to the implementation of the Lightning Network protocol, as well as the introduction of a USD/RVN trading pair. Support from Binance’s Changpeng Zhao also gave the coin more legitimacy.CRO, the native token of Crypto.com, has increased from $0.02 at the beginning of the year to $0.08 at press time. The 298 percent rise was the result of two significant peaks that happened since January, with the biggest one seen following the coin’s listing with Upbit in March.

309,CryptoSlate,There’s a new ‘Coinbase effect’—the Binance Chain pump,Priyeshu Garg,1555736940.0,"Binance has set its sights on usurping Ethereum with its new protocol blockchain. Since its launch, Binance Chain has attracted coins away from competitors, pumping the value of coins that switch. Could the “Binance Chain effect” be the new Coinbase effect?Since its announcement in 2018, Binance Chain has been one of the most highly anticipated projects in the crypto industry. The exchange’s very own decentralized blockchain platform has now set its sights on surpassing one of the largest cryptocurrency networks in the world—Ethereum.Related: Mithril (MITH) becomes the first project to launch on Binance Chain, surges 70%Binance has already attracted a slew of existing and upcoming cryptocurrency projects for switching to the new platform. Mithril was the first project to migrate to Binance Chain following its mainnet launch on Apr. 18th.The decentralized social media platform saw its native coin MITH nearly double in value the day it launched, jumping from $0.04 to roughly $0.08 in less than 24-hours.While MITH’s value is stabilizing, the effect of the Binance Chain launch cannot be disputed. This has led some to draw a comparison between the exchange’s new decentralized platform and past Coinbase listings.Coinbase historically has been the most conservative of the major exchanges in terms of coin listings and represented a large percentage of the US (and global) retail markets. If a coin was listed on Coinbase, it was perceived as a stamp of legitimacy, both from a regulatory and risk standpoint. Thus, whenever a new token was listed on the exchange, its value skyrocketed.The phenomenon was described as the “Coinbase effect.” However, Coinbase’s power over the market has diminished since its peak in 2018. Now, new listings seem to have little effect on a coin’s performance now, as was the case with Stellar’s XLM.$XLM added to Coinbase Pro but the pump started a week ago 🤔 pic.twitter.com/tmOFb3KEpk— Crypto Bobby (@crypto_bobby) March 13, 2019The Binance Chain EffectRestrictions placed on exchanges based in the United States have allowed Binance to establish a dominant position in the market.

310,CryptoSlate,Binance Coin (BNB) is one of the only cryptos to hit all-time high since 2017,Joseph Young,1555645380.0,"On Apr. 19, following the highly anticipated debut of the Binance Chain mainnet, the price of Binance Coin (BNB) surged by 10 percent against the US dollar, becoming the second crypto asset (after EOS in May 2018) since 2017 to achieve an all-time high.Other crypto assets that come close to BNB, digital assets created before 2019, are down about 20 to 50 percent against the dollar, with most other tokens down nearly 99 percent against the USD since the peak of the market in 2017.How Binance Coin (BNB) is the First Crypto to Surpass ATH Since 2017On Jan. 12th, 2018, Binance Coin achieved a record high at $24.46 after recording a 12-fold increase in value in a mere two months.In the past 24-hours, BNB surged by 11.2 percent against the US dollar and hit $24.77 following the highly anticipated launch of the Binance Chain mainnet, recording a staggering 309 percent gain year-to-date.The large increase in the value of BNB in a relatively short period of time suggests that investors in the crypto asset are confident in the long-term growth of the cryptocurrency, particularly in the decentralized exchange (DEX) and decentralized application (DApp) space.After the launch of Binance Chain’s mainnet, several blockchain projects such as Red Pulse and Mithril moved from smart contract protocols such as Ethereum to Binance Chain.$MITH will be one of the first projects to migrate tokens onto @Binance_DEX. Our community thank you for your support! https://t.co/zvG7tvtL2b— CZ Binance (@cz_binance) April 18, 2019Other large-scale projects like Enjin, which reportedly secured a strategic partnership with Samsung, announced support for Binance Chain and BNB.The Enjin Wallet will fully support #Binance Chain, including $BNB assets and @Binance_DEX exchange functions.We're excited to be a part of this @binance revelation and provide #EnjinWallet users with a convenient, secure, and precise trading platform.https://t.co/kP8zz6Vbht pic.twitter.com/vLhnEwpNLF— Enjin (@enjin) April 19, 2019However, even before the build-up towards the mainnet launch of Binance Chain, BNB has performed strongly against both bitcoin and the US dollar throughout the 16-month bear market.Related: Mithril (MITH) becomes the first project to launch on Binance Chain, surges 70%The solid performance of BNB throughout 2018 is mainly attributed to its coin burn mechanism—a process where profits generated by Binance, the crypto-to-crypto exchange—are used to buy back BNB from holders.The momentum BNB established by the buyback mechanism was fueled by the launch of a decentralized exchange in the first half of 2019, accompanied by the launch of its own blockchain protocol.In the upcoming days, Binance is expected to initiate the second largest token swap in the history of the cryptocurrency market, moving BNB which is currently based on Ethereum as an ERC20 token to Binance Chain.Interesting, 2nd largest swap in history.

Maker, the second most valuable token on the protocol, is valued at $620 million.Top 5 tokens on Ethereum (source; etherscan.io)What BNB has to Prove NowIf the price of BNB performed well throughout 2018 due to the buyback mechanism and rallied again in 2019 in anticipation of the mainnet release, then Binance Chain may have to show real potential as a high throughput and large capacity blockchain to retain those outsized gains.While the focus of Binance Chain is seemingly placed at supporting decentralized exchanges, it will have to demonstrate to investors that projects like Mithril and other blockchain platforms that plan to migrate to Binance Chain that they can function seamlessly on the protocol.The eyes of investors are now likely placed on how the Binance team will move forward with its plans for further decentralization for its DEX.Update Apr. 19 @ 7:40 pm PT: An earlier version of this article stated that BNB was the only coin to hit its all-time high since 2017, however, EOS hit its all-time high in May of 2018.

The company announced Mithril, a decentralized social media platform, will migrate to the chain and its MITH token will transfer from ERC20 to Binance’s BEP2 standard.Since its announcement in early 2018, Binance Chain has been one of the most highly anticipated blockchain projects to date. The exchange’s very own decentralized blockchain platform was built to maintain its position as the leader in the crypto industry.The exchange launched the Binance Chain mainnet and the network’s first project is about to go live. According to a press release, Mithril will be the first project to migrate to Binance Chain. Mithril is a decentralized social media platform built with content creators in mind. The company built a comprehensive ecosystem that revolves around MITH, its native token, which currently trades on over two dozen exchanges.Related: Binance Launches DEX Testnet for Peer-to-Peer Crypto TradingWhile the company’s vision was well received, its Ethereum-based token found limited use. The company said that by migrating to Binance Chain, MITH token holders will be able to experience the “speed, security, and user-friendliness” that have become associated with Binance.Mithril Will Test Out the “User Friendliness” of Binance ChainThe company’s native token, MITH, will begin its migration from ERC20 to BEP2 shortly after the mainnet launch of Binance Chain on Apr. 18th, the release said. Binance said that deposits and withdrawals of MITH on Binance.com will be disabled during the initial 12-hour migration period. Trading, on the other hand, will continue during this time.When MITH finally migrates to BEP2, Binance users will be able to withdraw the coin to any BEP2 wallet, which includes the Ledger Nano S. The exchange also noted that ERC20 versions of MITH held in private ETH wallets or on other exchanges will not be impacted by the migration.According to Mithril’s blog, the reason behind its migration to Binance Chain is the network’s usability. The company said that the security and incredible speed of one-second block times made the migration a strategic decision.Mithril Merchant Network partners have enabled the company’s MITH token to gain real-world usage and Binance’s user-friendliness will soon become crucial to its success, Mithril said in its release.Mithril Price SurgeSince the announcement, MTH surged over the last 24-hours.

312,CryptoSlate,ArcBlock tackles blockchain scalability by leveraging decentralized cloud computing,Mitchell Moos,1555473060.0,"ArcBlock has recently released the next milestone in its roadmap—ABT Node, which combines the worlds of cloud computing and decentralized blockchains. CEO Robert Mao and marketing lead Matthew McKinney describe the new update in an interview with CryptoSlate.ArcBlock is building a platform for connecting protocol-level blockchains, similar to Polkadot and Cosmos.A brief compare sheet of today’s interconnected blockchain networkThe Seattle-based company describes its service as a “3.0 blockchain” that enables applications to interact with networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger from a single codebase. The network aims to create an ecosystem of DApps that are “interconnected, interoperable, and independent, with no centralized controller.”ArcBlock (ABT) is currently ranked 160th based on market capitalization and is currently trading at $0.252 at time of writing. The ABT token is used for paying for access to the ArcBlock system.It Starts at the NodeAccording to McKinney, ABT Node aims to become the “world’s simplest blockchain node software.”For most cryptocurrencies, running nodes has been relegated to enthusiasts who are hardware and software savvy—or to full-scale server operations for cryptos with more centralized mining. Cryptocurrency mining is intentionally resource intensive, and the computations produced from proof-of-work mining have little value outside of securing a public blockchain network.McKinney emphasized that unlike proof-of-work, “ArcBlock’s mining model is based on value generation for the network.”Resources dedicated to securing the network are also tasked with performing useful computation as well—enabled by a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, according to ArcBlock’s technical documents.For those wishing to participate in ArcBlock mining or learn more, check out this link.Cloud Computing Meets BlockchainArcBlock leverages cloud computing servers rather than mining farms to give users the resources they need to build DApps—much like the current paradigm in modern software. The company goes as far as claiming that its software is the first that can run AWS spot instances in a decentralized manner.These nodes require “no centralized hubs or relays,” with the company describing the system as “completely decentralized.” To achieve this, the protocol utilizes proof-of-stake consensus with its ABT token.Explorer the ArcBlock Network using the official universal block explorer including the blockchain timeline, or monitor network status with a community-maintained block explorerAllegedly, nodes spun-up through this cloud computing model are fault tolerant, automatically upgraded, and easily migratable. Moreover, they can be run locally, connected direct-to-user, or connected to a public network to offer services online.In the first 24-hours of availability, ArcBlock saw more than 10,000 downloads, demonstrating there is strong interest in their approach.ABT Node recently provided several reference architectures using low-cost Digital Ocean servers and AWS spot instances for product blockchain networks. Using Digital Ocean’s $15 a month droplet, a user can secure 100 transactions per second (TPS) on the network, solving the bottleneck present in proof-of-work systems. For comparison, the Ethereum network can perform 15 TPS.ArcBlock offers a simple developer console and code samples.And, it seems cloud computing companies are taking notice of the new model. ArcBlock has so far secured partnerships with companies including AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, Upyun, AURO Cloud, and others.ArcBlock also recently joined the newly launched Cascadia Blockchain Council as a steering member. The council includes heavy-hitters in the Pacific Northwest blockchain industry including T-Mobile and Microsoft.ABT Node is at the very least promising. If software developers are able to operate on top of multiple blockchain protocols—and get the computing resources they need—then the pace of application development will be stunning.Learn more about ABT Node and ArcBlock.

313,CryptoSlate,World’s 250th most visited website reveals BAT contributions—analysis whether Brave browser can replace ads,Priyeshu Garg,1555494600.0,"The Internet Archive, a San Francisco-based non-profit digital library—reported receiving $2,500 in Basic Attention Token (BAT) tips. The browser’s micro-donations feature has also been endorsed by several other major websites, which could mean a web driven by ads and the sale of user data could become a thing of the past, suggested Archive.org.Brave Creators See Revenues from Micro-DonationsBrave, the first blockchain-based decentralized browser in the world, has entered the second quarter of 2019 with impressive growth. Brave browser’s number of active users has grown considerably, Basic Attention Token (BAT) has appreciated 160 percent year-to-date, and the number of high-profile websites enabling Brave Rewards has exploded.One of the earliest adopters of Brave’s ‘creator’ feature was Archive.org, also known as the Internet Archive. The San Francisco-based non-profit digital library signed-up to be a Brave creator a few years ago, having seen the micro-donations feature as a “fun experiment.”While it was initially only thought of as a way to support a like-minded tech organization, Archive.org was surprised to find that their tip jar had accumulated more than 9,000 BAT— the equivalent of $2,500.“This was an unexpected windfall. It was also proof that the current web, the one that’s driven by ads that know our every move, doesn’t have to be the web of the future,” the company said on their blog.Are Brave Rewards a Sustainable Alternative to Online Ads?After Archive.org enrolled in Brave’s reward program in 2017, many other large companies also joined the movement. First We Feast, an online food-culture magazine that has 5.7 million subscribers on YouTube, recently became a Brave Verified Publisher, along with the LA Times.Source: Brave Rewards panelConsidering the size of these audiences, these two publishers could significantly help Brave adoption. However, if the same rate of payment per visits and payment per user Archive.org reported also applies to these new publishers, ditching Google and Facebook ads might be a long way away.Archive.org reportedly received an equivalent of $2,500 from 2017 to 2019. SimilarWeb estimates that Archive.org gets around 100 million visitors every month, which if estimated liberally, would put its visitor count at almost 2.4 billion over the past two years.This means that Archive.org’s BAT (in USD) income per visit stands at just $0.000001. The figure translates to $1 for every one million visitors (roughly 8 million page views), which is minuscule by relative standards.Related: Brave’s New ‘BAT Community’ Unites Basic Attention Token Fans and Content CreatorsEven if all internet users of the world were active users of Brave, the extrapolated revenue would still not match earnings from ads.Currently, the internet has roughly 3.5 billion users and Brave has 5.5 million active users. If all internet traffic was active on Brave, we can expect the revenue to increase by roughly 636 times. To account for the growing number of users Brave has had since 2017, we will (arbitrarily) increase revenue 1,000-fold. However, $1,000 in revenue per one million visitors is not enough to supplant ads.For reference, it is standard for advertisers to charge per 1,000 impressions. Cost per 1,000 impressions can range anywhere from $0.1 to $50. The average for Google display ads is $2.80 while the cost for the same number of impressions on Facebook averages $7.20. A page can also run multiple ads simultaneously.Taking the lower of the two values, the revenue from one million visitors would equate to at least $2,800—a 64 percent decrease from Brave revenues alone based on these rough estimates.That said, seeing how the Internet Archive is the 182nd most visited page in the United States and the 258th most visited website in the world, it seems that Brave’s reward system is more of a supplement rather than an alternative to ad revenue—in its current iteration. Content creators can currently enjoy both ad revenue and donations from Brave users who block these ads.However, as Brave continues to innovate with its browser it is possible the organization cracks the advertising model.

314,CryptoSlate,"Binance delists Bitcoin SV following Craig Wright’s legal threats, BSV down 17%",Elikem Attah,1555299360.0,"Binance released an official statement informing users of the imminent removal of Bitcoin SV (BSV) from the exchange’s list of traded cryptocurrencies. The action follows Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre, the proponents behind BSV, issuing legal notices to those denouncing Wright as a fraud—and not Satoshi Nakamoto.The Delisting ProcessAccording to the statement from Binance, all trading pairs for Bitcoin SV will be removed from the exchange on 22nd Apr. 2019 at 10:00 AM UTC. It was clarified that all trading orders involving Bitcoin SV trading pairs will be automatically removed after trading in each trading pair is halted.Do the right thing. https://t.co/z7HGsAZnmR— CZ Binance (@cz_binance) April 15, 2019Users were assured that they will still be able to view their assets after the delisting of Bitcoin SV.  Assets can be viewed so far as users deactivate the “hide small funds” feature on the “funds page.” The announcement also disclosed that withdrawals will continue to be supported after Bitcoin SV is delisted.Bitcoin SV is down 16 percent, dropping from $71 to $59 a coin within the last 24-hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash is up 10 percent, increasing from $288 to $316 within the same timeframe.BSV 7-day chart on Cryptowat.chReasons for Delisting Bitcoin SVAccording to the press release, the decision to delist Bitcoin SV stems from the project’s failure to meet the exchange’s high standards for listed digital assets. “Changes in the industry” was also cited as a potential reason for delisting.Binance conducts periodic reviews to ensure that all listed digital assets continue to meet the exchange’s standards. The determining factors for delisting a coin or token were included in the statement from Binance. The factors were listed as:Commitment of team to projectLevel and quality of development activityNetwork / smart contract stabilityLevel of public communicationResponsiveness to our periodic due diligence requestsEvidence of unethical/fraudulent conductContribution to a healthy and sustainable crypto ecosystemBinance CEO Issued a Warning Prior to the AnnouncementThe announcement comes four days after Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO of Binance, threatened to delist Bitcoin SV from the cryptocurrency exchange.

Furthermore, In a widely condemned move, Craig Wright, a computer scientist and the leader of the Bitcoin SV team, posted a $5,000 bounty for anyone who reveals the true identity of Hodlonaut.Following Peter McCormack’s light-hearted response to the threats, CZ put his support behind the podcaster and followed up his comments by adding that Wright is indeed a fraud.Master piece!

315,CryptoSlate,BitMEX Research: Bitcoin SV miners have lost more than $2.2 million since fork,Mitchell Moos,1555239600.0,"Since Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) split in November 2018, miners supporting BSV have endured estimated losses of over $2.2 million to ensure that the fork’s network is secure. A large part of this mining is conducted by an operation owned by Calvin Ayre.Forking the Bitcoin ForkMuch like how Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was forked from Bitcoin, in November 2018, the leaders behind BCH had a dispute over the technical direction of the project during a scheduled update.Related: Explained: Bitcoin Cash Hash Wars, Where the Factions Stand on the IssuesRoger Ver, an early Bitcoin investor and promoter—and Craig Wrightcr, a computer scientist who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto—disagreed on the block size for Bitcoin Cash. Wright wanted to increase the block size limit, among other changes. As a result, Wright and his allies forked BCH to create Bitcoin SV (BSV).The fork resulted in the stakeholders in the community picking sides. Major miners, including Bitmain, sided with BCH while CoinGeek’s mining operation, owned by Calvin Ayre—a Canadian-Antiguan entrepreneur and billionaire—sided with BSV. These mining operations spent millions mining at a loss to undermine the security of the opposing fork.Mining at a LossBecause of how proof-of-work consensus operates, it’s necessary that people continue to mine at a loss to support the Bitcoin SV network to maintain its security against 51% attacks and chain re-organizations. Should these miners stop then BSV would likely lose much of its value, and it is likely that Wright and Ayre have large holdings of Bitcoin SV incentivizing them to continue supporting the network.On Apr. 12th, 2019, BitMEX Research released estimates on how much miners have lost supporting Bitcoin SV. BSV miners have accumulated gross losses of $2.2 million for electricity alone. These losses are even larger once hardware depreciation, overhead, and labor are accounted for.Source: BitMEX ResearchMeanwhile, those supporting Bitcoin Cash ABC (which is widely referred to as Bitcoin Cash) made a gross profit of $42.4 million.Profitability of 100x S9 Antminers at $0.08 per kWh on WhatToMineThere is strong evidence suggesting that a large part of the mining conducted for BSV comes from an operation owned by Calvin Ayre. According to data from crypto-statistics platform Coin Dance, CoinGeek controlled 28 percent of the network’s mining power. It’s unclear why other miners are mining the coin instead of more profitable BTC or BCH.The research suggests that it doesn’t make financial sense to support the BSV network. Thus, Ayre’s motives for supporting BSV could range from clout in the crypto-sphere to potential upside on coin appreciation should the project gain momentum.

318,CryptoSlate,Experts argue on whether to go short or long on Binance Coin,Omar Faridi,1554620400.0,"Binance Coin, a widely-used utility token issued by Binance, was one of the best performing cryptocurrencies of 2019. Despite BNB’s impressive Q1 performance, Nick Tomaino, founder of crypto venture fund 1confirmation, thinks it’s the right time to short.During the first three months of 2019, Binance Coin (BNB) was arguably the best performing cryptocurrency. From the beginning of January to the end of March, BNB went from $6.02 to $17.29 based on aggregated CoinMarketCap data—a 187 percent increase.2019 year-to-date; CoinMarketCapNotably, the performance of Binance Coin is almost a perfect mirror of BTC’s performance, with a greater positive beta relative to BTC. For example, if BTC goes up 2 percent then BNB may go up 4 percent.However, recently, bitcoin’s recent bull run seems to have decoupled the relationship between BNB and BTC. The price of BNB has been relatively flat over the last few days, reflecting the sentiment that exchange coins tend to do better during bear markets. Furthermore, each BNB went from trading at a high of over 0.043 BTC to 0.037 BTC per coin.Over the last week, Bitcoin is up 25.2 percent while Binance Coin is up 10.6 percent.“Don’t Short Cryptocurrencies—Except For BNB”Tomaino, a former Coinbase employee, believes shorting cryptocurrencies is a “losing game.” However, he argued that Binance’s only succeeded because of its business model of “regulatory arbitrage” and its “minimal” know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.Shorting cryptocurrencies is a losing game. But if I had to short a cryptocurrency right now, it would be Binance Coin. Here’s why (from my western bias):— Nick Tomaino (@NTmoney) April 4, 2019In addition to highly flexible trading limits and a strategy of “aggressively” adding new cryptos, these few factors have allowed the exchange to enter the market and gain 40 percent market share in less than two years, suggested Tomaino.Yet, Tomaino asserts that Binance was able to capture this market share while offering a “poorly designed product.” He blasted the company on Twitter for a user experience that is “worse than many decentralized exchanges” (which are notorious for being hard to use) and for the exchange’s failure to meaningful contributions to the crypto space.Competing With Bitcoin?Tomaino goes on to argue that BNB is essentially competing with Bitcoin since the ‘business model’ of both coins is regulatory arbitrage.However, unlike Binance, the world’s most dominant cryptocurrency protocol cannot be shut down because of its decentralization. An exchange, on the other hand, can be in instances of new regulations or a catastrophic hack.With BNB competing with Bitcoin, Binance “does not enable anything new,” said Tomaino.That said, there still is a bullish case for BNB token. Tomaino argues that if Binance continues to maintain its dominance in the cryptocurrency exchange industry then the token will likely succeed. This is contingent on Binance evolving with improvements in decentralized exchange (DEX) services, Tomaino said.It’s All About the MoneyTomaino concluded his arguments by suggesting that BNB holders are loyal to the financial upside, not Binance, which takes away from the value of BNB:Finally, from what I can tell the community of Binance Coin holders doesn’t stand for much beyond making money. At the end of the day a community of believers is what gives cryptocurrencies value. Something tells me BNB holders will be on to the next money making opportunity soon— Nick Tomaino (@NTmoney) April 4, 2019Presenting a counter-argument to Tomaino’s assertions, Dovey Wan—a “market cycle agonistic” investor and partner at crypto fund Primitive Ventures—stated that regulatory arbitrage is an oversimplified way to explain Binance’s business model.Competition from Huobi, Upbit, and KuCoinWan explained that the majority of digital asset exchanges founded by Asian entrepreneurs are operating a business model similar to Binance.My counter arguments with cross-boarder bias. Thread👇🏻1. “Regulation Arbitrage” is an over-simplified western fairy dust.Most Asian exchanges, compliant or not, are doing what Binance is doing: aggressively listing new assets with minimal KYC, such as Huobi, KuCoin, Upbit https://t.co/yvtuOHXbna— Dovey Wan 🗝 🦖 (@DoveyWan) April 5, 2019For example, Wan noted that Huobi Global, KuCoin, and Upbit were all operating with minimum KYC/AML requirements and that they were also aggressively listing new coins in an attempt to generate more revenue, much like Binance.Instead, Wan asserts that cryptocurrency exchanges only need three competitive advantages to succeed: robust security, adequate liquidity, and affordable trading fees.Binance has been able to provide the best liquidity while maintaining the lowest fees. Moreover, the exchange has never suffered a major hack. Regulatory arbitrage alone does not “magically get you depth” in your order books or equate to a “robust backend,” she argued.She also offers one more explanation for Binance’s success—innovation. When the exchange started in mid-2017, it was the first to trade NEO gas tokens, long before other industry players managed to do so. This, Wan believes, helped attract the first cohort of investors to Changpeng Zhao’s exchange.Nothing Wrong with Centralized TrustAdditionally, Wan said that Binance’s management took the initiative to expand its operations during the cryptocurrency crackdown by China’s government, which began in September 2017.Related: No, China Has Not Legalized Nor Put an End to Bitcoin Ban; Inaccurate ReportsAccording to her assessment, Binance’s current success can be attributed to its excellent customer support service and “real trading depth.” This, at a time when other exchanges have been accused of manipulating trading volumes.There’s nothing wrong with having “centralized trust” in people like Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, Wan said.Diversifying OperationsElaborating further on Binance’s business model, Wan argues Binance is not a single, vulnerable, company waiting to get “shut down.” Its operations are divided into many different subsidiaries including Binance Academy, Binance Info, and Binance Launchpad, among others.Related: Binance’s ICO Platform Ready for TakeoffBinance currently employs around 300 professionals and does not officially have a headquartered office. This, she claims, effectively makes Binance “decentralized.” Furthermore, the exchange has not received substantial VC funding, allowing it to remain more independent.Finally, Wan argued that if a company as controversial as Tether Ltd. can manage to get banking partners then there’s no reason why Binance should not be able to get one in the future—even in the face of regulatory scrutiny. Wan concluded her argument by saying:“‘Regulatory arbitrage’ is not arbitrage but [an] outcome of the game [involving the] theoretical dynamics of different countries’ attitude towards crypto. Like when China [banned crypto], I found it extremely bullish as it means US will never ban it. Same thing [applies] to Japan, Korea, [and] Singapore.”In aggregate, whether a crypto-investor is going short or long on BNB, it seems there are strong arguments for both sides.

320,CryptoSlate,Binance uncovers “design flaw attack” for Augur prediction markets,Mitchell Moos,1554094440.0,"A design flaw in Augur allows ambiguous prediction markets to be gamed for profit, according to Binance Research. Furthermore, the report detailed other issues that “plagued” the Augur platform, including prediction market wash trading, low liquidity, and limited participation rates.In an Apr. 1st report, Binance Research has uncovered a myriad of issues with Augur, the Ethereum-based decentralized prediction-market platform, including evidence of wash trading on prediction markets, limited user participation rates, low liquidity, and a concerning design flaw where attackers can potentially scam honest users.Understanding Augur’s “Design Flaw”The flaw revolves around creating prediction market that resolve as “invalid.” According to the Augur white paper, an invalid market is one that is “not suitable for resolution by the platform—for example, because it is ambiguous, subjective, or the outcome is not known by the event end date.”However, these invalid markets are sometimes difficult (or subjective) to identify. Malicious actors can take advantage of this for profit.When a market resolves as invalid, bettors in that market are paid out at “equal values for all possible outcomes.” For example, a market with two outcomes would have the reward split equally between both outcomes. A market with three outcomes would have it split three ways, and so on.Yet, because some prediction market outcomes differ in probability, the cost of betting on each outcome also differs. By creating markets (which are likely to resolve as invalid) where one outcome is highly likely and the other unlikely, an attacker can place bets on the unlikely outcome and profit from honest participants when the market is deemed invalid.The warning message displayed by Augur.casino, as of Mar. 31st, 2019, describes the issue succinctly:“If a market resolves as invalid, each share is refunded to traders in equal amounts. If the reporting start time (UTC) isn’t after the actual end of the event, or if the title/description and reporting start time don’t match up, there is a high probability that the market will resolve as invalid.”Example of an Controversial MarketOne example of an at-risk market is one with volume surpassing 4,000 ETH. The market is set to expire on Apr. 1st, 2019 at 1:59 AM (UTC +8). Yet, in the additional details section, it states “General Price of Ethereum Cryptocurrency at end of day March 31st, 2019 UTC.”Source: Ethereum Price at end of March 2019Because the “title/description and reporting start time don’t match up,” there is a chance this market will resolve as invalid. As stated by Binance Research:“The fact that the market specifies one end date in the title/description and a (slightly) different one in the expiration date renders it invalid, allowing the poll’s creator to purposefully bet on the losing outcome and get paid out regardless.”Source: Ethereum Price at end of March 2019Based on the above values, if the market resolves as invalid, bets on each outcome would resolve at a value of approximately 0.33, meaning that bets on “$1000 or above” and “$0 – $100” would result in a 65 percent gain while bets on the most likely outcome, “$100 – $1000,” would result in a 46 percent loss.That said, the report only cited one past example of the flaw. Yet, that market resolved normally even though it was both purposefully vague and included a potential date conflict, suggesting that on-chain governance is capable of dealing with some of the issues raised.Combating Bad ActorsThe way Augur currently combats this problem is through a combination of mechanisms. First, a market creator must provide a “validity bond,” an amount staked by the market creator that is slashed if the market resolves as invalid. However, market behavior indicates that the cost of these bonds is low enough where users can “repeatedly create bogus markets at a fixed cost,” according to Binance Research.The second way (along with other ways) Augur solves the issue is through the dispute mechanism. If the settlement of the market is disputed, then REP holders can vote to decide which outcome is correct. In some circumstances, even if a market should technically be ruled as invalid based on Augur’s documentation, voters may decide that a market with tricky wording resolve based on voters’ reasonable interpretations. As such, this pits “code as law” ideologists against “pragmatic” voters, as said by Binance Research.Response from the CommunityThe community has known about the exploit—at the latest—since Mar. 19th, with one popular Reddit post titled “Augur is being gamed!” garnering significant attention. Other crypto media outlets have also covered the exploit since Mar. 20th.On Mar. 19th, Joey Krug—a core developer for Augur, a co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital and co-founder of Beam—explained that concern over the exploit was overblown:This is kinda fake news for a few reasons. #ethereum @AugurProject1) Almost all of these purposefully confusing markets are being created by one person, not a bunch of people. The activity on those markets is also by one person / address. https://t.co/9jLIeGqun9— Joey Krug (@joeykrug) March 20, 2019Furthermore, the core developer tweeted that a new category for “invalid” bets will become tradeable in the next version of Augur, effectively addressing the exploit:This will be fixed in v2 of augur.3) Invalid will be a separately tradable in v2. So markets where this is happening can be easily filtered out, and people trying to do the attack described in the OP would auto trigger the filter by virtue of their trading invalid.— Joey Krug (@joeykrug) March 20, 2019Augur’s Progress on Addressing the FlawAccording to Binance Research, the Augur team has already identified the attack mentioned, as well as other potential improvements for version 2 of the platform. However, the report also criticized the project for failing to address these issues in a timely fashion:“The Augur team has already admitted that these technical problems were on their radar 6 months ago, but little action has been taken to protect users.”The report also provided several potential solutions to the attack, including a price-based refund mechanism, clearer warnings and disclosures, and even a new “market validator” category of participant. Allegedly, if these issues aren’t resolved:“While Augur is a strong use-case of blockchain, if some of these issues are not handled properly moving forward, the Augur ecosystem could be left with only its malicious actors and bystanders, as honest participants [are left] repeatedly losing funds and then leaving the ecosystem,” said the report.

He also elaborates on the differences between his blockchain and Ethereum, EOS, and TRON.Primer on TomoChainTomoChain (TOMO) is a blockchain protocol based out of Singapore that advertises itself as secure, low latency, and “near-zero” fees, primarily positioning itself as a contender with Ethereum. Currently, the project is ranked 112th based on market capitalization.The protocol relies on a system of 150 master nodes and takes advantage of a “proof of stake voting” (PoSV) consensus mechanism. Other interesting aspects of TomoChain include several purportedly “novel” techniques for increasing chain finality—a feature which reduces the likelihood of double-spend and 51 percent attacks—through block double validation and the use of a randomization process for selecting validators.The founder of TomoChain, Long Vuong, is a Vietnamese entrepreneur who studied business and commerce, receiving his master’s degree in economic development from the International Institute of Social Studies of Erasmus University Rotterdam. He went on to become a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts.Interview with Long VuongVuong joined CryptoSlate on Feb. 23rd in an interview with Mitchell Moos to discuss his strategy for TomoChain, his progress with the project, and his long-term outlook on the overall blockchain industry:Overall, based on statements from Vuong, TomoChain appears to be another project that is attempting to carve out a niche in the competitive protocol-level blockchain space.

337,CryptoSlate,"Basic Attention Token Now Redeemable at Over 250,000 Brands Including Amazon, Starbucks, Uber, and Apple",Mitchell Moos,1551234900.0,"Brave users can now redeem Basic Attention Token for real-world rewards from over 250,000 brands including Amazon, Apple, Starbucks, and Uber. The new feature comes from a partnership, announced Feb. 26th, with TAP Network, a blockchain based digital advertising platform.Brave Partners with TAP NetworkBrave Software is a  privacy-focused browser looking to change the way users interact with ads; The company also leverages a cryptocurrency, Basic Attention Token (BAT), to achieve that aim. Brave announced that it was partnering with TAP Network at Mobile World Congress on Feb. 26th.TAP Network is an advertising and data platform “powered by blockchain technology.” The company aims to “give consumers control over their data and preserve their privacy while offering real rewards,” complementing Brave and its goal of building a private and seamless browsing experience by innovating in the digital ads space.Brendan Eich, the CEO of Brave Software, said the following about the new partnership with TAP Network:“We’re excited to welcome TAP Network as a partner for our ad platform that’s built completely on privacy, and together, reward users for their attention while opening doors for brands that are looking to connect ethically with new audiences.”Lin Dai, the co-founder and CEO of Tap Network stated:“We are excited to partner with Brave to further the mission of protecting consumer privacy and rewarding users for participating in the advertising ecosystem.”Basic Attention Token Redeemable for Rewards from 250,000 BrandsThe new partnership allows Brave users to redeem BAT tokens through TAP Network’s 250,000 plus brand partners. This gives BAT holders the ability to redeem tokens for gift cards from Amazon, Apple, Uber, Starbucks, and other recognized brands. Users will also be able to redeem earned tokens for hotel stays, restaurant vouchers, and “exclusive entertainment experiences.”Furthermore, users can also use BAT to contribute to the Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, World Wildlife Fund, and other charitable causes.Opt-In to Ads for RewardsThe announcement also promotes a feature in Brave browser where users can opt-in to watching ads through Brave Rewards. Currently, desktop users can choose to view ads from advertisers (many of them from the TAP Network) to earn Basic Attention Tokens.Eich had the following to say about the current advertising environment:“Both the user and the advertiser lose in today’s digital advertising landscape, and with regulations like GDPR looming all over the world, this broken ecosystem simply cannot continue as we know it.”And Dai goes on to add:“Consumer data is being misused by major internet companies and TAP Network empowers consumers to directly take control of their own data and get rewarded from top brands.”Expansion Plans and ImpactBrave is looking to partner with other ad networks to expand its rewards offerings and also looks to roll the feature out to mobile platforms by the end of 2019. According to the announcement, Brave is working to integrate options from BuySellAds, AirSwap, Fluidity, ConsenSys, and Uphold into its Brave Ads catalog.One of the largest challenges Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies have faced is acceptance. High fees and technical complications have made many vendors reluctant to accept crypto.Yet, it seems that Brave and Basic Attention Token has been able to overcome this problem by working with advertising networks. BAT was able to expand its network by hundreds of thousands of vendors, substantially growing the reach and utility of the cryptocurrency. Perhaps this will offer a model for other projects to follow for more widespread acceptance?

338,CryptoSlate,Zcash Solves GDPR Compliance with Shielded Addresses and P4 Protocol,Atul Ajoy,1550901720.0,"Zcash, one of the first privacy coin to leverage zero-knowledge proofs, is further cementing its vision of privacy-protection by engineering its blockchain in a way that is GDPR compliant by “default.”Primer on GDPRThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European Union’s regulation protecting personal data and privacy; its goal is to return personal data to individuals within the European Economic Area. Among EU and US companies, GDPR has been accepted as a new standard for data regulation—companies have paid a lot of attention to become compliant with these new rules.With the GDPR we are building a European sovereignty on data. We have to do the same for the cloud, for AI, for innovation at large. #VivaTech— Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) May 24, 2018Crypto advocates claim that blockchain will return data ownership, privacy, and identity back to users. However, this vision is sometimes at odds with GDPR. Due to the immutable nature of distributed ledgers, some information is stored forever on public blockchains. And, because of Article 17, the right of erasure—colloquial known as the “right to be forgotten”—isn’t always designed into blockchain-based services.The right of erasure revolves around the concept that a user can request the deletion of personal data at any time. This places greater responsibility on online services to more carefully store and access personal data. Moreover, these rights are especially important in an era where hacks and cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly prevalent, giving users the opportunity to remove their personal data before it’s stolen later.Blockchain and GDPRUnfortunately, the idea of immutability is in some ways at odds with GDPR. Fortunately, blockchains can be engineered in a way that is compliant, like what Hyperledger Fabric is doing in its new 1.4 private data collection or Zcash which is GDPR-compliant “by default.”Shielded addresses are GDPR compliant by default. These addresses are never at risk of leaking data in a post-compliance scenario because they neither store nor transmit identifiable information at any point in the transaction process. Learn more: https://t.co/djmivttCHv— Electric Coin Company (@zcashco) February 18, 2019Zcash’s Shielded Addresses and P4Private Periodic Payment Protocol, or the P4 Protocol, (a protocol is a collection of agreements to communicate in a specific way) is used for private subscription cryptocurrency payments. The P4 Protocol was developed by Least Authority, the same company that Zcash grew out of, and utilizes shielded addresses as well as Tahoe-LAFS (a free and open source decentralized cloud storage system) for data storage, further reaffirming that Zcash’s shielded addresses are compliant.Zcash uses cryptography to create a private “shielded” ecosystemUnlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Zcash’s shielded addresses inherently prevent data leaks and data theft. In Zcash, transactions do not transport identifiable information, eliminating the need to track data through the transaction process. By leveraging a zero-knowledge proof technology called “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge,” or zk-SNARKs for short, the Zcash blockchain can function without revealing as much information as other blockchains.In greater detail, zk-SNARKs is a proof system that allows the Zcash software to prove that a statement is true without revealing any other information. The technology leverages “homomorphic encryption” which is a form of encryption that allows computers to perform operations on already encrypted data without compromising its security.The P4 Protocol builds on all of these technologies, allowing decentralized applications to accept subscription payments in a GDPR-compliant way, representing another production use case for this technology. By embracing GDPR, Zcash could lead the way and encourage compliance among other blockchain and cryptocurrency projects within the ecosystem.Posted In: Zcash, Altcoins, Privacy, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

340,CryptoSlate,RChain Cooperative May Need to Liquidate RHOC Holdings to Remain Solvent,Mitchell Moos,1550368500.0,"An analysis of RChain Cooperative’s October balance sheet suggests the organization is insolvent with its liabilities greatly exceeding its liquid assets. To meet its liabilities, the organization may need to liquidate a large portion of its RHOC holdings or find another way to renegotiate or refinance its obligations, giving credence to allegations that the organization is “functionally bankrupt.”RChain’s Decline?RChain is a blockchain project that promises to use “rho-calculus” to solve Ethereum’s scaling issues. Notable figures working on the project include lead Ethereum researcher Vlad Zamfir and former Microsoft software architect Lucius Gregory Meredith.In January of 2018, RChain’s RHOC token was trading at over $2.80. Now, each token is worth less than $0.03, with the company’s market cap rank dropping from a peak of 30th to where it is currently at 227th.The drop in price possibly stems from a series of allegedly bad financial decisions—including the purchase of a 5-year audio codec license from Immersion Networks for $23.5 million, resulting in potential insolvency.Assets and ICOInitially RChain’s private community sale of RHOC raised $30 million, retaining a large reserve to continue financing ecosystem development. The rest of the organization’s assets are either held in cash, other cryptocurrencies, or real estate.Readily accessible assets include $2.2 in cash and approximately $1.5 million in liquid cryptocurrencies. The company could also liquidate its $1.5 million property, which is allegedly a “house in Seattle for cooperative members to stay in,” according to the Block Crypto. These assets total roughly $5.2 million.The organization also claims that it is holding approximately 480 million RHOC. CryptoSlate reached out to RChain Cooperative about its current RHOC holdings and received the following response from Derek Beres, the Cooperative’s director of content, providing the following figures:410.7 million RHOC sent to reserve wallet RCM (RChain multisig), 50.6 million sent to token sale wallet, and 4 million sent to research wallet, for a total of 465 million RHOC.Based on these current figures, the organization’s reserve of 465 million RHOC would currently be valued at approximately $13 million, down from $63 million.Yet, daily volume for RHOC ranges from $90,000 to $400,000, which indicates that liquidating all $13 million worth of RHOC is likely impossible without significant slippage—meaning that RChain Coop is unlikely to receive the full $13 million if it sold its holdings.In the footnote of the financial statements, the Cooperative even states that “RHOC is not readily transferable and illiquid as a monetizable asset,” further reaffirming this possibility.Short-Term LiabilitiesShort-term liabilities are financial obligations that RChain Cooperative is required to pay within 12-months.RChain’s contractual obligations—agreements that may be potentially renegotiable—include $5.6 million for “Immersion,” which is likely one of the payments for rights to the audio codec mentioned earlier—$2.2 million for “Management Fee Strategic Partnership” with “Reflective Ventures,” a blockchain specific venture fund that works closely with the organization—and, $3.6 million for “Pyrofex,” a contract blockchain development firm tasked with building much of RChain’s software.Meanwhile, non-negotiable liabilities mainly revolve around taxes. The Cooperative estimates 2017 income taxes payable of $3.5 million and has not yet published estimates for 2018 income taxes and taxes related to revenues from selling RHOC.Other notable, but smaller liabilities include $393,000 in “Founders Compensation” and $120,000 for “Website.” Overall, it’s uncertain which of these liabilities are renegotiable.These liabilities total at least $16 million, not including pending tax estimates. Netted against accessible assets of $5.2 million, this leaves a deficit of at least $10.8 million that is contractually payable in under 9 months.If the Cooperative is unable to pay its debts using its accessible assets (which it won’t be based on October figures), then the organization will either need to renegotiate its contracts, find additional financing, or liquidate a portion of its 465 million RHOC to remain solvent—or all of the above.CryptoSlate reached out to RChain Cooperative president Lucius Gregory Meredith to comment on some of these concerns and has yet to receive a response.Leadership TurnoverIt was previously reported that lead developer Medha Parlikar, CFO Kate Gonsalves, and three other board members have resigned from the Cooperative’s board. On Feb. 14th, the COO Kenny Rowe announced his resignation.Rowe was the co-founder of MakerDAO and advisor to Aragon with experience in “sustainable governance.” When asked for comment on his motives for leaving, Rowe responded:“I was offered another opportunity that was a better fit for me and my family.”The high turnover in RChain’s leadership may suggest the organization is struggling. Combined with the organization’s potential financial difficulties, RChain Cooperative may be in trouble for 2019.Posted In: Seattle, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Specifically, the exchange makes potential delisting decisions based on the following criteria:Commitment of the team to projectLevel and quality of development activityNetwork and smart contract stabilityLevel of public communicationResponsiveness to Binance’s periodic due diligence requestsEvidence of unethical or fraudulent conductContribution to a healthy and sustainable crypto ecosystemWhile Binance did not make specific comments about which of the above criteria were unmet for each token, recent news could suggest some of the underlying reasoning for the delistings.SALT Lending, the issuer of SALT token, was subpoenaed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission last November. The SEC cited the legality of the platform’s $50 million token sale, according to the Wall Street Journal.Substratum, a US-based project working on building a “decentralized web,” recently faced removal of its SUB token from the popular Exodus wallet due to “errors” relating to the token’s recent “smart contract migration.” Substratum has also missed several key milestones for its SubstratumNode software despite promises that it would be ready for release by the end of 2018.Impact of DelistingThe gravity of a Binance delisting cannot be understated. The majority of trading activity for CLOAK, MOD, SALT, SUB, and WINGS takes place on Binance. Following the delisting, these projects will lose their primary source for trading volume, with Binance previously accounting for 50-95 percent of trading volumes for these tokens.The market has also taken notice of the delistings. The five to-be-delisted tokens responded with a 12 to 32 percent drop against BTC the last 48 hours. Traders and investors of CLOAK, MOD, SALT, SUB, and WINGS should note that trading will cease on Feb 22, 2019, at 10:00 AM UTC, while withdrawals will continue until May 22, 2019, 10:00 AM UTC.Industry-Wide Trend?This trend of token delistings is not a new phenomenon. In December 2018, Huobi placed 32 tokens into an “ST” (special treatment) category, citing “insufficient trading volume” and “investment risks to users.” Among the 32 ST tokens were SALT and SUB–two tokens from Binance’s delisting announcement.In the same month, Kucoin placed MOD into its ST category and followed the action by delisting SUB in January of 2019.It appears that an industry-wide trend of delisting tokens with low trading volumes, questionable legality, and poor development progress is unfolding. It will be interesting to see how these major delistings will affect the behavior of these projects, and crypto projects in general, over the coming months.Posted In: Binance, Altcoins, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
342,CryptoSlate,"CEO of Dash: Cryptocurrency More Than a Bolivar Hedge, It’s a Way to Survive in Venezuela [Interview]",Darryn Pollock,1549698540.0,"Dash CEO, Ryan Taylor, says a few factors saw them enter the Venezuelan market three years ago, but the political situation has made their cryptocurrency a critical survival tool for many in the beleaguered country.Dash, a portmanteau of Digital Cash, has in many instances for the public in Venezuela become a way in which to negotiate their economic standings in the South American country, which is under tremendous civil unrest, because of its cash-like nature.It is not only the fact that the native fiat currency, the Bolivar, has hyperinflated to a point where it is virtually useless, but it is also the financial limitations imposed by the government and its central bank which has seen a migration towards the cryptocurrencies such as Dash and Bitcoin.Taylor admits that there are use cases where people have invested in Bitcoin to try and preserve the value of their money, utilizing the major cryptocurrency as a store of value. But it is Dash’s adoption and quick, cheap transactions that are making it an important financial tool in Venezuela.Taylor spoke to Cryptoslate about how they noticed a potential gap in the market in Venezuela:“There was a bit of recognition from locals in Venezuela for Dash,” Taylor said. “That started the initial community that has been built. But it was also a recognition that it could be a great market for us.”He went on to elaborate on how Dash laid the infrastructure for transactions in cryptocurrency, leveraging an existing crypto service:“Back in early 2016 we approached a company based out of Panama that was providing services in Venezuela called Cryptobuyer, and we felt like we needed to set ourselves up to have a marketplace there that people could easily get the coin in and out of. We recognized that there would be demand there, and there would be an opportunity for us, so we laid the infrastructure to allow that to happen.”Things have moved rather rapidly in Venezuela for Dash’s adoption as Taylor explains: “In February of last year, there were about 600 merchants that accepted Dash. Today they are about 2,700, and this growth was in a bear market.”Part of the growth is owed to Dash actively approaching merchants and educating them about using Dash as a payment option. However, there must also be a demand for an alternative currency and payment system in the country’s broken economy.Taylor explains that a lot of the merchant adoption came about because of factors that many outside of Venezuela would not give a second thought to.“They [the merchants] did it because it is not just because of the currency, the currency is a big reason, but what we discovered was there are other problems with the payment system there,” said Taylor.He went on to elaborate on the deficiencies of the payment system in Venezuela, which has been crippled by decades of authoritarian governance, on top of financial sanctions from the United States:“The infrastructure goes down; there are limits on the amount people can transfer, the number is so low that one dinner with your friends would wipe it out—if you want to make a large purchase, you need five friends to each pay for a part of it. Cash is completely broken, when you think just use a credit card, even small purchases, that can be a problem, you need something that is cash-like, and we provide that solution without the restrictions.”Taylor also explains that because of the exodus out of Venezuela, there is a growing need for remittance payments as family and friends need to send money back home, but there is no point in them receiving it in Bolivars:“Over 30,000 people are crossing the border every day, they are doing it out of desperation,” Adds Taylor. “They need to send money back to their family. Sending through the bank takes a significant amount of time and high fees. If they have a currency that is digital and useable at merchants throughout the country, then that solves a real problem for them.”The Economist talked about the exodus from Venezuela, where over 10 percent of the population have left because of conditions in the country. During Nicolás Maduro’s term, Bolivar, the local currency, has become worthless, violence has soared, and utilities have become widely unavailable.“I’ve had people tell me that Dash has saved their lives,” said Taylor.In a country rife with instability an independent cryptocurrency makes a lot of sense. It’s hard to seize, easy to transact, and difficult to stop. Taylor went on to say:“This isn’t about a need to hedge their way out of the currency, for that there is Bitcoin if you are trying to store wealth. But when it comes to transacting with it, using it like cash, we are the ones out there educating the merchants, getting them signed up, educating the consumers on how they can use it as part of their lives and that what makes it far more relevant than other cryptocurrencies out there.”Venezuela seems to be the first proving ground for cryptocurrency replacing a local currency. That said, it is an outlier in the sense that the local currency is being devastated by hyperinflation, so any asset is a better store of value than Bolivars.However, the verdict is still out on whether Dash, or any other digital currency, can develop a payment system in a country with limited infrastructure. If cryptocurrency can do that then adoption in places such as Africa, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe could be next.

343,CryptoSlate,Analysis Suggests that 85 Percent of Monero Network is Dominated by ASICs,Mitchell Moos,1549597380.0,"Within the last 40 days, analysis suggests that Monero is once again dominated by ASIC mining, with 85 percent of the network hash rate coming from this specialized computer hardware. The author was able to detect this new wave of ASICs via mining nonce forensics.Background on MoneroMonero is an open-source cryptocurrency created in April of 2014 that focuses on “fungibility, privacy, and decentralization. Monero uses an obfuscated public ledger, meaning no one can see the source or amount of transactions within the system.Monero is known for its use of ring signatures, A well researched cryptographic technique where a group of signers is merged to authorize transactions, obfuscating who the actual signer (sender) of a transaction.How Nonce Forensics WorkIn a Medium analysis performed by pseudo-anonymous user MoneroCrusher, the author suggests that more than 85.2 percent of the Monero network is mined via ASICs.According to the author, in theory, nonce distribution should be a random number between 0 and 2^32. However, for whatever reason, different mining equipment, and mining algorithms tend to produce patterns in how nonces are chosen.CryptoSlate also reached out to MoneroCrusher for comment but has yet to receive a response.What are Nonces?A nonce is an arbitrary random number that is part of the brute force process used in mining. When mining, the goal is (typically) to find a hash below a target number, which changes based on mining difficulty. This number is hashed with a few other inputs such as a timestamp, the previous block hash, and the Merkle root, producing a random number.If this random number is smaller than the target number, then the miner wins the block and consensus is reached.Monero’s nonce distribution chart; chart courtesy of Apollo Open ResourceNonce Patterns Can Correlate to ASICsBased on the analysis, the author suggests that the ASICs that ran on the network did not choose nonces randomly. Instead, ASICs intentionally tried to conceal them by aligning nonce selection with patterns that existed pre-ASIC, the author asserted.However, as these ASICs dominated Monero mining it became obvious that a disproportionately large number of blocks were being found in that particular nonce range, producing a distinct pattern.Monero Hard Fork Purges ASICsIn April of 2018, Monero successfully hard forked and implemented a new mining algorithm to thwart ASICs. At the time of the fork, Monero’s hash rate dropped from 1030 Megahashes per second down to 158 Megahashes per second, again suggesting that 85 percent of the network was ASICs.Within three days it appeared that new GPU miners returned to, once again, profitable Monero mining, stabilizing the network hash rate at roughly 480 Megahashes per second.Chart courtesy of BitInfoChartsAt the time of the purge, the author found that the absence of ASICs was immediately noticeable on the nonce distribution chart. Areas which previous had a high concentration of nonces disappeared.ASIC Manufacturers Potentially Obfuscate NoncesSince the hard fork in April of 2018, it seems that ASICs have returned to Monero. The author detected another unusual pattern on the nonce chart. A new “wall” of increased randomness that “suddenly came online.” Yet, this time, the ASIC manufacturers were allegedly more clever in obfuscating the nonces produced by their machines:“ASIC manufacturers had learned from past mistakes and implemented random nonce picking.”However, the nonces chosen were too random. According to the author, in a “natural” state, nonce picking in Monero isn’t completely random either. The new wave of ASICs introduced “over randomness,” making it once again detectable via nonce forensics.As ASICs once more came to dominate the network competition for blocks intensified. This coerced traditional GPU miners to once again leave to mine other, more profitable coins.Impact of ASICsOverall, the statistics from the analysis are stunning, with the author stating:“At the time of writing the network hash rate has increased to 810 Mh/s or 255% since the first signs of the ASICs at the end of December 2018, or approximately 40 days ago.”He concludes that the network hash rate “likely consists of 85.2% ASICs (5400 ASIC machines) and some die-hard GPU miners and botnets.”To read MoneroCrusher’s full analysis, go to his Medium post here.History of ASIC Resistance in MoneroThe proliferation of ASICs on Monero is problematic because it increases centralization on a network. In a centralized network, malicious exploits such as 51 percent attacks are, theoretically, easier to execute.Monero’s community has taken a stance that is strongly anti-ASIC. Especially when compared to Bitcoin, where ASICs have become a fundamental part of its ecosystem, and Ethereum, where the core development team is neither for or against ASICs (although an interest group around ProgPoW wants to change that for ETH).To combat ASICs, the Monero community plans to actively change its mining algorithm. This was demonstrated in the past via previous hard forks. Since ASICs are specialized at solving a single, or narrow set, of mining algorithms, such changes tend to render ASICs ineffective or useless at mining.Ethos Against ASICsMonero’s ethos to combat ASICs can be seen in their GitHub. One of the group’s most commented on ‘Issues’ is “Idea for ASIC resistance,” where the group crowdsources ideas for combatting ASICs. Another hotly debated—and much more controversial—thread in the Issues section of Monero’s GitHub is “Proposal to consider an ASIC-friendly proof of work.”Something to note, Monero is an open-source project, so there is no “official” stance of Monero. That said, the overall community leans strongly towards ASIC resistance. One comment in the second of the two threads effectively embodies Monero’s feelings towards ASICs:“I think ASICs give too much power to the miners. Yes, I’ve read the logic that ‘well the ASIC can only be used to mine that coin so therefore the miners will always support that coin and their intentions are good’ but we shouldn’t care what the miners support. The miners get rewarded for providing a service to a decentralized network, where the value is completely dependent on the extent of decentralization. The network is not rewarded by the service of the miners.”Although, there are still those who believe ASICs can benefit a network:“I think ultimately it’s futile to try and constantly fork away from ASICs. The original idea of CryptoNight [mining algorithm] afaik [as far as I know] was that it was somewhat equivalent between CPUs, GPUs, and theoretical ASICs, and I think trying to meet that original vision [of Monero’s] is probably more realistic than trying to constantly fork to prevent ASICs from mining on the network.”Monero’s Time to ActIt seems that the Monero community must once more make a decision. If the analysis is correct—and XMR is indeed dominated by ASICs—then the community will either need to implement another hard fork with a new mining algorithm; or, decide that ASICs dominating the Monero network is acceptable.Based on Monero’s past history it seems likely that they will choose to hard fork, so prepare accordingly.Posted In: Monero, Altcoins, Analysis, Mining, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

344,CryptoSlate,Verge Founder Justin Sunerok Talks About the Future and Potential of XVG [Interview],Mitchell Moos,1549536120.0,"Justin Sunerok, the founder and lead developer for Verge Currency, joined CryptoSlate for an interview yesterday. He answers questions about his motives, the project’s progress, and talks about the facts surrounding the coin’s earlier 51 percent attacks.Verge was created in mid-2014 by Justin (Vendetta) “Sunerok” Valo under the name DogeCoinDark. The coin was later rebranded to Verge Currency.Verge is a privacy coin designed for “everyday use,” and advertises itself as an improvement on the original Bitcoin blockchain with “fast, efficient, and private transactions.” As stated by Sunerok:“Verge was started in 2014 and it was meant to be a fun, privacy-based, Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency. It evolved into much more.”Justin Sunerok is a long-time network administrator and software developer based out of Florida. In an interview with CryptoSlate, he answers questions about his involvement with the project:Justin Sunerok’s Professional BackgroundWhen asked what his background was before getting involved in cryptocurrency, he said:“I got into programming when I was 8 years old. I went to a gifted school in New York, and it was the only class I liked.”Sunerok continued by going into his late teen and early adult life:“After high school, I got into network administration and worked for a fortune 500 company in Boston. I did that for a few years and then I decided to start working for myself. And I did that for a very long time. I ran my own little network security company.”From these beginnings, Sunerok fell into Bitcoin after hearing about it from his network:“Then, in 2011 or 2010, I started hearing a lot more about Bitcoin from friends and eventually I justed jumped in head first.”The Inception of Verge CurrencyAccording to Sunerok, in 2014 the privacy coin space was new, and there was only two other serious projects—Bytecoin and, to a lesser extent, Monero in its early stages—all other coins were more or less “proof-of-stake clones” of Bitcoin. From beginnings as a proof-of-stake mining pool operator, Sunerok was exposed to dozens of projects as part of implementing those coins into his mining pool:“As the admin, every day I was adding two or three coins. And every day I was removing two or three coins because they were just coming and going. These guys had fancy OPs on Bitcoin Talk promising all this stuff, and of course, nobody was delivering. And they all had a pre-mine. Saying ‘oh, we only pre-mined half a percent or one percent of total supply… I worked for a while compiling code non-stop for this [mining pool]. So I decided maybe I should make my own project for fun… All these other guys were doing it and they’re pre-mining and profiting from just making crap and hot air promises.”Later, Sunerok launched the first iteration of Verge, called DogeCoinDark, and decided he “was going to do a fair launch, and actually try and set goals and work on them.”Verge Pioneering in the Privacy Coin SpaceAccording to Sunerok, Verge Currency is a pioneer and ‘first’ in many ways:“We are pioneers in a lot of senses. We’re the first to put I2P… We were the second to have I2P nodes. We were trying to focus on all the new aspects of privacy.”Then, when asked what makes Verge a better choice over mainstream privacy coins like Zcash and Monero:“You can’t really say one is necessarily better than another. There are a lot of different opinions on how privacy should work on a blockchain. You have an opaque chain like Monero, which people complain that it’s hard to see any double-spend attacks or other exploits.”Monero uses a type of cryptography to obscure transaction amounts and senders that make it hard—if not impossible—to detect if there is a 51 percent attack happening or another exploit. Sunerok continued:“We focused on user privacy for their physical location in their home address. Our first goal was to eliminate IP addresses from the network. [Although] Zcash comes with Tor out-of-the-box now, it didn’t then. And Monero still doesn’t.”An IP address is a unique identifier that computers use to communicate over a network. There are ways that this identifier can be used to determine the physical location of a computer. Sunerok elaborates on the issues with IP addresses in a blockchain system:“If I can use a network client to actually locate your home through your coin’s network… I feel like that’s probably not privacy… And at the time, that was one of the most common ways people could trace any transaction through Bitcoin or Litecoin, by tracing back through your IP address…”Volunteers Fuel VergeThe funding mechanisms for cryptocurrency projects differ vastly. Some projects like Zcash allocate a percentage of mining rewards to a development pool. Other projects like Ripple and TRON maintain a large chunk of total tokens and sell those over time to fund development. Based on the interview, Verge has neither of those and is fueled entirely by volunteers:“And we have a huge team now, and it’s all volunteers. And everybody does because they like the vision… We’re one of the only coins without a pre-mine or an ICO so I also think that makes us one of the safest…. I can get involved in this and not have to worry, ‘is the SEC going to arrest one of the founders? Is somebody going to dump a billion of these because they pre-mined it?’ Stuff like that.”However, there are still some skeptics who doubt this kind of governance:“I’ve been hearing since 2014 that Justin is going to dump on everyone and leave someday. Yet, here I am.”Bitcoin Turned into Financial FreedomWhen asked how Sunerok pays his bills, he responded that he was lucky enough to catch the cryptocurrency craze to allow him to work full-time on Verge:“I got into Bitcoin very early. Before I started building Verge, I was doing development for hire stuff and different coins would hit me up if I could help them… and I said you can just pay me in Bitcoin. And, back then, Bitcoin was $100 or $200. I did really well from Bitcoin, and it really gave me a lot of freedom. It was one of the reasons for my decision to pursue this project and take a year off. And, it was successful.”Sunerok then elaborates about his standard of living and his thoughts on financial freedom:“I’m certainly not Roger Ver [wealthy] or anything. I don’t have a whole lot of Bitcoin, I’m not living in a palace. I don’t think financial freedom is being able to jump on a yacht and cruise the Mediterranean. But if it allows you time to focus on your passion, then that to me is freedom.”An Average Day for SunerokCryptoSlate asked what an average day looks like for Justin. On a work level, he said:“People on the team can imagine how busy it gets. DMs [direct messages] on a thousand different platforms and on top of that I’m in a chat room with other developers. We constantly talk about bugs and how to fix them, review pieces of code, write new pieces of code, or talk about the direction [of the project]. Stuff like that. And, everyone once in a while I pop into community chats and say hello to everybody.”In contrast to his work life, Sunerok also talked about the importance of his family:“Yeah, I wake up, I make breakfast for my daughter. I have a three-year-old. Definitely family first, work second.”Yet, sometimes work gets in the way of spending time with his family:“For instance, we’ve had mining exploits in the past and I’ve had to stay awake for days working on fixes for them. Talking to different exchange admins and pool admins trying to get everything on track to make sure that people update on time and troubleshooting with them… that kind of stuff. Usually, if there’s something big going on I stay awake for a couple of days.”Considerations Around Verge’s 51 Percent ExploitsWhen asked to elaborate on the 51 percent attacks that Verge has suffered, Sunerok said the following:“We’ve had a few 51 percent attacks. In 2016 we were Script [mining algorithm based]. We had our first time-warp attack [then] and it was devastating.”He then went on to talk about how the community reacted in the face of the attack:“I woke up and everybody was freaking out. All my [chat] platform icons were blinking and I had DMs everywhere that said ‘oh my god, somebody with so much hash power has just completely taken over our chain.’ We were one of the first coins to get hit because that’s when we started having monetary value. It made us a target.”Sunerok also elaborated on some of the economics as to why coins are exploited:“Generally, the coins that have value are [vulnerable to being] exploited. There are coins below the top 100 but it’s generally not worth it because there’s no fungibility or way to liquidate.”The main reason as to why a coin will get 51 percent attacked is purely economic. As rational actors, miners will often do what’s best for their wallets. Sometimes this goes against what is best for a cryptocurrency community.Verge Suffers Another ExploitSunerok continues into how Verge adopted its multi-algorithm mining and explains how it suffered its next attack:“I stayed awake for a couple of days and we forked into a multi-algorithm [for mining]. We said this is probably the best idea… they probably won’t be able to control all five algorithms. Two years later we faced our next exploit which… I wouldn’t really call a 51 percent attack, it was more a spoof in difficulty attack.”He goes on to describe the specifics behind the mining “spoof in difficulty attack” by first talking about Nakamoto consensus more broadly: “most codebases work with whoever has the longest blockchain is the winner,” said Sunerok, referring to the rule where the longest blockchain is considered the canonical or “true” blockchain in the Bitcoin white paper.However, a malicious attacker can withhold submitting blocks to a network to conceal that they are conducting an attack. This played into how Verge calculated mining difficulty, which determines how much computing power is required to mine a block. This requirement adjusts periodically to ensure that a network remains resilient and sufficiently rewards miners who help maintain a network:“If you are able to create your own node system, and listen on the network, and not send anything back to the network, you can essentially lower the difficulty yourself, and you can obviously mine blocks very quickly if you have higher hash power. This will make your block height accelerate rapidly and then once you actually connect to the network the network is going to see ‘oh wow, look at how long this chain is, this must be the right one.’ And, if you have multiple nodes [then the submitted chain is] going to become consensus.”Then, Justin Sunerok talks about how his team tackled the exploit:“We didn’t have a perfect fix we just knew that if we closed the time drift itself it wouldn’t be monetarily worth it for them to only be able to do this for a few minutes. This bought us a window, and [at that point] we said it’s time to rebase and bring [Verge] up to speed with the latest Bitcoin codebase.”Which, according to Sunerok, is more challenging than it may appear:“Which is actually really difficult because I had initially forked from SeedCoin which was a proof-of-stake and made it strictly proof-of-work so there were a lot of little kinks to work out.”Did the 51 Percent Attacks Undermine Confidence in Verge?In a follow-up question, Sunerok is asked whether the 51 percent attacks undermined confidence in the project. His response:“I think that most people see something like that and realize that it’s because Verge has value. That’s why we didn’t really lose our community over it. Our community is as big as it has ever been. All of our chat platforms are insanely packed with people, we have tens of thousands [of people] on them… Verge is valuable because we have a really big community, and we actually do work, even during this bear market.”Verge’s PartnershipsSunerok first dives into Verge’s “biggest partnership,” with MindGeek, which is the world’s largest pornography conglomerate, owning services including Pornhub, RedTube, and YouPorn, to name a few. Verge crowdfunded 75 million XVG, or roughly $3 million at the time the crowdfunding campaign was complete, in order to release the name of their new partner.Some speculated that no such partner existed and that Verge was simply manipulating the price of the coin or “pulling an exit scam.” He first counters accusations that he used the partnership to steal money from the project:“One [partnership] I get a lot of flak for is our MindGeek partnership. I get accused a lot of just stealing the money and running. The wallet that we raised the money to for MindGeek belonged to MindGeek, so I never even had access to those funds.”He then goes on to talk about his logic behind the push:“I saw it as a really good opportunity because they are one of the largest companies on the internet. They are almost the size of Facebook, they’re huge. I think it was a great move because it got so much attention. It was another first in the cryptocurrency space.”Ultimately, Sunerok stands by his decision to partner with MindGeek, saying “it got us publication in every major media outlet,” making the move (in his mind) well worth it.Justin Sunerok then talks about how Verge was able to deliver on servicing the adult industry, seemingly as a way to contrast against his allegations of having stolen funds:“All these coins that come out, even ICOs recently, promised to become the token for the adult industry. None of them did it. Where did all that money go, where are those guys?”In a more recent partnership, Sunerok talks about NetCents, an online cryptocurrency platform for making payments and shopping securely:“Most recently we partnered with NetCents which turned out to be really massive. They are really motivated and driven guys. They are also making announcements every week and getting new partnerships. That’s really our second largest partnership deal.”What Sunerok Says About Detractors:In response to those who criticize Verge, Sunerok first said this about the cryptocurrency space in general:“It’s a very cutthroat space. It’s similar to penny stocks, where people are constantly bashing the CEO and the chiefs of the company, trying to manipulate markets.”However, Sunerok claims that he already has a wealth of experience dealing with this kind of environment:“I’ve already dealt with that stuff… through investing. I’m from New York. I have very thick skin. And, I’m pretty much from the internet, and I’m used to trolls; I’ve been a troll. I see accusations all the time and I challenge anybody that wants to talk bad about me to come on a live stream— and that’s why me and you are talking—I didn’t like the articles you had written about Verge, so I said let’s do a live stream, and surprisingly, you’re one of the only people who hasn’t backed down.”Addressing the Fervor of “VergeFam”When asked whether the zealous community of Verge supporters is ever a problem, Sunerok added:“Investing to people can be an emotional thing. If you put money into something you believe it kind of becomes sacred to you. That becomes your baby and you want to see it come to fruition. You want to see it grow. You want to see it get better. And of course, just as if it was your child, you want to defend it from bullying.”He goes on to say:“I have no control over what the community does. I’ve seen a lot of controversial things happen within the community and I just kind of sit by and watch because that’s just part of how this works.”Competitors Want to Bring Verge Down?Answering why some people are so critical of Verge, Sunerok talked about the “cutthroat” nature of cryptocurrency projects:“Crypto itself is vastly open-source. A lot of people are hands on. There a lot of investors. Verge is just one in a whole world of that. You have 40 some-odd coins above you that want to maintain their position and don’t like you, and you have 2000 coins below you that want to pull you down and climb over you.”Fortunately, according to Justin Sunerok, he’s “used to that”:“I’m used to that kind of stuff, I get asked that question a lot. I think people expect me to have an emotional reaction. I really don’t. If I did, I definitely wouldn’t be here right now.”He continues that the vitriol that is thrown at Verge actually fuels him:“I’m a very competitive guy. I see that stuff like fuel, like sugar to me, that it’s a good thing that people are talking, good or bad.”Justin Sunerok’s Personal ObjectivesWhen asked what he wants out of Verge, and whether he wants to work for Verge “until retirement,” Sunerok retorted that he “strives to be the best” at everything he does:“I’m not sure how people will react when I answer this. Everything I’ve done in my life, I’ve done [because] I strive to be the best. When I was younger I was in gymnastics and I eventually made it into junior Olympic gymnastics. I ended up lifting weights and I became a state champion powerlifter here in Florida.”He then cites a recent example of where Verge was the best:“Verge has become the top in volume for about a week straight. Where we were getting even more volume than Bitcoin.”According to Justin Sunerok, his goal is to have Verge “become the best.” In his words:“I want Verge to be the best. I have that mentality, and I have no shame in that. I want to see Verge be number one. That may or may not ever happen. But I’ll settle for number two or number three and know that I did my best.”Questions from the CommunityIn response to “what can #VergeArmy and #VergeFam do to help the project with mass adoption,” Sunerok said:“I would say that the Verge Fam is already doing what they need to do. We didn’t retweet anything about this [interview] from my account or from the Verge account, but they found your post [anyway].”In Justin’s words, Verge Fam is already doing what needs to be done:“The Verge Fam is already doing what they need to do… People bring things to my attention all the time, just random community members, ‘hey did you see this, did you see this, what do you think about this?’, so they’re already doing it. The community couldn’t really be any better.”The dedication from the community is sometimes even comparable to people who work on the Verge team:“There are people who are as active, or almost as active, as people who are on the team. They’re in front of the computer 18 hours a day and they’re either people that are hungry to one day have a very high-value cryptocurrency portfolio or they’re people that already have a high-value cryptocurrency portfolio that can spend the time [being active].”Sunerok asserts “this coin would be nothing without them,” referring to Verge’s strong community.Statement to those Who Doubt VergeIn response to what Sunerok thinks about those who “doubt the validity and success of Verge”:“I’m still here. It’s 2019 and here I am. Especially if you go to our Bitcoin Talk thread when we first launched: ‘Oh, this guy is never going to be here. He’s going to leave in a week. He’s going to dump on everybody.’ Here I am.”Price Speculation on VergeAnother Verge holder asked when Sunerok thought XVG would break its downtrend. He responded that he doesn’t really watch the market:“That’s one thing that has helped me stay here this long is I don’t care about the market at all. Some people don’t like to hear that. For my own sake it’s necessary. If I paid attention to charts all day I’d become emotional. As the founder, I have a really big role and responsibility at this project so I don’t have time to be emotional.”Timeline on ReleasesAnother user asked a question about Verge’s timeline, asking for clarification as to when future updates—including RSK smart contracts and new codebase—will be complete. RSK is an open-source smart contract platform with a “2-way peg to Bitcoin, allowing Bitcoin miners to merge-mine and participate in smart contracts.” First, in response to the question about RSK:“We started talking with RSK six months ago. We kind of put that off until we [finished] the updated code base. They have a lot of stuff they’re willing to offer us in collaboration. I’m really excited to get that stuff out there. RSK is definitely going to happen, especially now that our new codebase is done. It’s almost like it’s plug-and-play.”Sunerok then elaborates on Verge’s new codebase:“Before, we had a very Frankenstein codebase, where it was proof-of-work using a proof-of-stake base. I think that [new codebase is] definitely going to come to fruition within the next few months… we released the alpha of our newest codebase and it’s now public. And we’re getting a lot of great responses. Still some bugs to work out but I think we’re going to have it in beta any week now.”Does Sunerok Still Do Graffiti?In the past, Sunerok talked about his love for graffiti, even listing it as a hashtag in his Twitter account. Another commenter asked if he still participated in the art form:“I haven’t done anything in quite a while. As some community members know, when I was in my twenties my two favorite things were graffiti and hacking. That is what I lived for. I mostly stuck to trains, painting them. I haven’t done graffiti in about five years now.”That said, Sunerok does plan to reignite his enthusiasm with spray paint and canvas:“But I did, six months ago buy a lot of really large canvases and I do plan on making a big order of spray paint soon. The community will definitely know when I start painting again.”Addressing His Criminal RecordOne point of controversy around Verge is Justin Sunerok’s criminal record. Publicly available conviction and arrest information shows that from 2003 to 2010, that Sunerok was arrested eight times on a variety of charges including criminal mischief, prowling, traffic violations, and failure to appear in court.Other arrest information from Charlotte County shows that he has been arrested for trespassing, giving a false name, and the possession of Schedule 1 narcotics. In response to an aside about his criminal record, Justin Sunerok said:“I had someone ask, ‘I read once that you were arrested for mushrooms, and I’ll respond yeah, what are you some kind of square?” I was arrested once for marijuana, and now I have a medical marijuana card.”He goes on to elaborate about his interaction with the law during his early adult life:“I did stupid stuff in my late teens early twenties. Sometimes, I’d get a ticket from not wearing a seatbelt or something and I’d just crumple it up and throw it away, and I’d forget all about it, and then my license would get suspended. Just stupid stuff. There’s nothing on my record that’s malicious or like ‘oh my god, keep your kids away from him.”’Moreover, according to Sunerok, he has matured a lot since his twenties:“At this point, I’m a father, I work at the computer all the time, and I’m responsible. I had a great time in my twenties, it was amazing. I wouldn’t change any of it.”Strengths and Weaknesses of VergeIn a final question, Justin Sunerok was asked what he thought the strengths and weaknesses of Verge were, and what they are today. One of the biggest was growing pains around task delegation:“In the past, I was managing so much by myself. When we first launched, and up until a year ago, I had primarily done everything. I released our Android wallet, our Electrum servers, our codebase updates, and I was maintaining that stuff all by myself, and I was all over the place [because of that]. I wasn’t sleeping a lot. I had a lot of three or four-day benders staying wide and working on stuff.”However, Sunerok now would actually say that this is actually one of Verge’s strengths:“So I would say that now that has become one of our strengths. Not everybody can be so lucky as to have one of their greatest weaknesses turn into one of their greatest strengths. Now I have a small team of developers that work with me that share the vision, and they’re all very talented.One thing that Verge—and many other projects—still struggle with as a weakness is communicating between a large, distributed team:“One thing that has been really difficult, that I think a lot of people will understand, is working with a very large team from all around the world can have communication issues. Normal stuff, but nothing overly dramatic.”In conclusion, Sunerok said this about Verge:“I’d say we’re a pretty well-oiled machine. All of our weaknesses have become strengths. And all of our strengths are still strengths.”Although XVG had some setbacks, the project seems to have recovered. In the past, one critic described Verge as one of several “dead” projects. However, based on the vibrant community and Justin Sunerok’s comments, it appears Verge is very much alive.

345,CryptoSlate,Stably’s StableUSD (USDS) Scheduled for Listing on Binance Feb. 6th,Mitchell Moos,1548993300.0,"The Pacific Northwest’s StableUSD is scheduled for listing on Binance on Feb. 5th. Stably’s USDS is a cryptocurrency that aims to introduce additional transparency and reliability into a fiat-backed stablecoin.Binance announced that it will list StableUSD (USDS) on Feb. 5th, 2019 at 19:00 PST, Feb. 6th 03:00 UTC, for BTC to USDS and BNB to USDS trading pairs. Traders can also deposit USDS prior to listing in preparation for trading.Comments from Stably’s ExecutivesIn an interview with CryptoSlate, Stably’s CEO Kory Hoang expressed his enthusiasm in the scheduled listing:“The Stably team is beyond excited to have the opportunity to list on Binance and show the world that the Seattle crypto scene is very much alive and still kicking!”Meanwhile, Mahraan Qadir, VP of marketing at the company, elaborated that the team is not content with stopping at the Binance listing:We’ll continue to pursue additional exchanges to list on, expand on trading pairs, and work with market makers to provide liquidity to the crypto market.”What’s notable is what the team was able to accomplish with minimal capitalization. Unlike some projects which receive millions in funding and then go on to deliver lackluster results, it seems that Stably has been able to bootstrap its way to getting listed on the world’s largest exchange by trading volume:“Just half a million dollar of seed capital and less than a year of development were all it took for this scrappy team of former Amazon engineers to build a world class stablecoin and list it on the largest cryptocurrency exchange on the planet.”Stably’s success could be an outlier or could be indicative of a larger trend. Following the ICO-craze of 2017, more cautious investing and more capable teams may lead to a greater number of projects innovating in the space without the need for large amounts of outside investment.That said, Stably still has a lot of work to do to become a relevant stablecoin.For example, the circulating supply of StableUSD is still limited, potentially harming liquidity. Only recently has Stably’s market cap surpassed $6 million, in comparison to Tether’s market capitalization of over $2 billion.Fortunately, listings on exchanges such as Bittrex and Binance will increase liquidity and encourage more users to deposit USD with the startup.Plans for ExpansionOn the heels of the Binance listing, Stably is already looking for ways to expand its product offerings and innovate in the stablecoin space. Hoang elaborates:“We have MAJOR plans for this year, including creating a global remittance network, developing a privacy meta-stablecoin, expanding across multiple protocols, and, of course, listing our tokens on a lot more exchanges.”And Qadir expands on Kory’s mention of multiple protocols, talking about how Stably plans to offer an equivalent stablecoin on Stellar and EOS:“Stably plans to exist on several blockchain protocols. We are already live on Ethereum, and plan to expand to other protocols including Stellar and EOS.”Yet, even with Hoang’s optimism, the stablecoin space is highly competitive. There are currently over fifteen visible stablecoin projects that are racing to usurp Tether’s (USDT) incumbent position; Many have forecasted USDT’s demise based on its questionable business practices, and these smaller stablecoin projects are likely looking to take advantage of a potential vacuum.For now, Tether has remained the dominant stablecoin in the market, even if its market share is getting eroded by new entrants such as Circle’s USDC and Gemini’s GUSD.Whether Stably can continue its momentum and solidify its position as a dominant stablecoin in the sector is still to be decided.Posted In: Binance, Seattle, Altcoins, Exchanges, Interview, Privacy, Stablecoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

346,CryptoSlate,Dash Venezuela Team Issues a Response to Embezzlement Accusations against Dash Merchant Venezuela,Priyeshu Garg,1548893460.0,"Eugenia Alcalá, the CEO of Dash Venezuela, issued a statement following embezzlement accusations against Dash Merchant Venezuela, a separate Dash-funded organization. Some in the community are still outraged. Meanwhile, the CEO apologized for delays in delivering its balance sheet and praised the team for its “positive achievements.”Dash Merchant Venezuela Team Accused of EmbezzlementDash Merchant Venezuela, the team tasked with increasing adoption of the Dash cryptocurrency in the country, has faced accusations of embezzlement and manipulation from its community.The accusations stem from Dash Watch, a website ran by other Dash enthusiasts. At the beginning of 2019, the website published financial reports for last quarter of 2018, which showed missing funds. The reports accused the team and local merchants of providing false data around salary payouts.Over $64,000 in salaries was allegedly left unaccounted for after the audit. After receiving the report, some Masternode Operators (those who are able to vote on proposals and allocate funds in DASH) and general community members were outraged.Response from the CommunityThe discussion section for one of the more recent funding proposals put forward by the Dash Merchant Venezuela team captures some of the community’s sentiment:“I have been one of the biggest supporters of this and all projects involved with getting Dash integrated into Venezuela… I’ve voted for all their proposals up to now (as well as this one), and have personally donated to their projects. However, after the revelations about their falsifying financial data, I’ve changed my vote to a “No” vote for this specific proposal. I don’t think such behavior can be rewarded and go unpunished,” said one Masternode Operator.Another Masternode Operator went as far as to call the high salaries that managers of the project in Venezuela were paying themselves “embezzlement”:“… they are rubber-stamping high US-$ ‘salaries’ for themselves in one of the cheapest countries of the western hemisphere. Does McDonald’s pay their branch managers in Venezuela 3,000 US-$ a month ??? No. They pay them the regular local salary. We are talking here that these two guys are letting the DAO [DASH’s treasury mechanism] funds rain down over themselves to an extent that they are earning 500 times a normal salary per month. THIS IS CALLED EMBEZZLEMENT.”Another community member was more forward with the accusations:“DASH MERCHANT VENEZUELA WAS SET UP TO DEFRAUD THE DAO AND HAS EMBEZZLED AND STOLEN/MISAPPROPRIATED OVER 64,000 USD OF PROPOSAL FUNDS TO DATE.”However, there were also some who defended the results of the team and suggested that the lapse of financial reporting was circumstantial:“Yes, these young and inexperienced guys made a mistake of judgement to try and protect themselves from further attacks. Not just physical attack in Venezuela but also attacks from a small group of individual hell bent on destroying their project work and DASH Watch who ran an extremely in-depth detailed analysis of every aspect of only the financial’s of this project that had the Dash merchant team working full time 7 whole days to provide all the details that DASH Watch wanted.“Overall, the vote to fund the team’s “Dash Merchant Venezuela 5000 Merchants” proposal is contentious, with 390 yes votes, 394 no votes, and 76 abstentions so far.The Venezuela team was quick to address the issue, apologizing for the false information they provided. The merchant team said that they published fake information for “privacy and personal safety concerns,” explaining that they were afraid of the political situation in the country. Alejandro Echeverria, one of the co-founders of the team had this to say:“We didn’t want our salaries and our employee’s salaries to be disclosed due to the high risk this involves. We have, however, agreed to provide it privately with Dash Watch. We have already provided the accurate information to them and will continue to cooperate as much as we can. We still made a mistake and we say sorry.”Dash Venezuela’s Official Response“We deeply regret the new difficulties facing the Dash Merchant team, whom we consider talented people. We are sure that they will be able to respond to the concerns of the entire community,” the company said in the statement.The team also noted that they encouraged regular and transparent debates on social media, but will work with developers to verify all of the users participating in such discussions. The statement cited the example of users impersonating the identity of Eugenia Alcalá, the CEO of Dash Venezuela.The team also addressed the issue of the late delivery of their balance sheets to the community. The economic crisis in Venezuela had forced the company to “carry out a deep process of internal restructuring,” which caused a delay in publishing last year’s balance sheets. The team accepted responsibility for the delay and invited the community to review the published documents.Last year’s performance allegedly shows that Dash is on its way to turning Venezuela in the first “crypto nation” in the world.Eugenia Alcalá said that the company managed to reach “important numbers” when it came to training, adoption, downloading of wallets, and extensive brand positioning in Venezuela. The team at Dash Venezuela reportedly gave over 100 interviews both to local and international media outlets, a testament to the increasing adoption of the coin.Updated Feb. 8th, 00:00 PST: Clarified title and introductory paragraph by mentioning that Dash Venezuela and Dash Merchant Venezuela are separate entities within Dash.

347,CryptoSlate,Brave Browser Teams Up with Cheddar to Engage “Crypto Crazed” Users,Darryn Pollock,1548843540.0,"Cheddar, a popular live-streaming financial news network, announced a partnership with Brave Software—the privacy browser behind Basic Attention Token. The move leverages Cheddar’s viewers who are “obsessed with crypto.”The partnership will provide free subscriptions to premium Cheddar content for Brave browser users, allowing hundreds of thousands of users to take advantage of Cheddar’s premium subscription.Brave users who take advantage of the offer will receive access to Cheddar Premium for three months. This includes live feeds to the Cheddar Business and Cheddar News channels on Cheddar.com.According to Jon Steinberg, CEO of Cheddar (and former president of BuzzFeed), the partnership was a natural progression considering the interest its users have for cryptocurrency:“Cheddar viewers are obsessed with crypto; we even have a show dedicated to it—The Crypto Craze. The idea of unlocking our premium feeds for Brave users via crypto funding, with no sign-up, seemed like a natural way to engage a passionate community that will no doubt enjoy our content,” said SteinbergFor Brave, the partnership will help grow its user base; Cheddar offers “premium content” that satisfies Brave’s typically cryptocurrency-savvy users.“We’re excited to work with Cheddar to enable Brave users to seamlessly access premium Cheddar content,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “Our platform reconnects users and publishers without compromising privacy, and access to premium content is one of the key ways to grow our audiences.”Brave markets itself as a privacy-focused browser, leveraging blockchain to accomplish that aim. The company’s Basic Attention Token (BAT) looks to solve issues surrounding advertising by paying users for their attention when subjected to ads.Brave’s native token, the Basic Attention Token was added to Coinbase in November 2018, allowing Coinbase customers to buy, sell, send, receive, and store BAT. In September 2018, Brave also partnered with Civic (CVC), a blockchain digital identity service, to further protect user privacy.These strategic partnerships might be necessary for Brave browser to succeed in the highly competitive browser landscape.According to StatCounter’s November 2018 data, browser use across all platforms (desktop, tablet, and mobile) is 62 percent Google Chrome, 15 percent Safari, and 5 percent Firefox. This leaves Brave with little space to compete unless the service can provide compelling reasons for users to switch.Perhaps blockchain and cryptocurrency will be the edge that Brave needs to succeed.

348,CryptoSlate,TRON’s BitTorrent ICO Raises $7 Million in 15 Minutes,Priyeshu Garg,1548808980.0,"Binance Launchpad, the token launch platform of Binance, conducted an ICO of TRON’s BitTorrent tokens (BTT) on Jan. 28th., with tokens selling out in less than 15 minutes. Almost 60 billion tokens were sold, raising a total of $7 million. According to Binance’s CEO, the sale’s “demand was astronomical.”BitTorrent’s Token Sale CompleteDespite the ongoing cryptocurrency bear market, a newly launched token (BTT) managed to exceed expectations. The sale was announced on Jan 18th., with Binance saying that it would be exclusively offering TRON’s tokens on Binance Launchpad.According to an official blog post from the company, the token sale ran in two simultaneous sessions: one for purchases using Binance Coin (BNB) and another for purchases using TRON (TRX), both of which sold out quickly.Data has shown that the Binance Coin (BNB) session lasted 13 minutes and sold 23.8 billion BitTorrent tokens, while the TRON session closed in just over 14 minutes, selling 35.6 billion BTT.BitTorrent tokens were priced at 0.00001824 BNB or 0.00447261 TRX at the point of sale, both roughly equivalent to $0.000115 at the time. The minimum amount of BTT eligible for purchase was 100,000 ($11).Issues Arise Amidst the EnthusiasmJudging by trading prices at the time of the sale, the company sold tokens worth over $7 million in less than 15 minutes. The enthusiasm surrounding the token sale has made BitTorrent’s ICO the most successful offering of the year, so far.However, the ICO’s incredible popularity has caused a slew of issues to arise preventing many users from buying the coins. Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, the CEO of Binance, went to Twitter to explain that Binance was experiencing technical issues.Full transparency. The issue experienced today was caused by the ""user agreement confirmation"" button caching/locking. Most of the stress tests focused on the buy process, this part was not covered thoroughly enough. The order of requests received was preserved.— CZ Binance (@cz_binance) January 28, 2019Despite CZ’s quick response, dozens of users have criticized the process, saying they were unable to buy tokens. Some users suspected foul play, pointing out that the sell-off started with more than 28 percent of the tokens already sold. Many believe the company manipulated the data, calling the entire sale a “scam.” It is yet to be seen whether the critical comments will affect the companies.Justin Sun, the CEO of TRON, said that he would explore the possibility of the airdrop. Later, Changpeng Zhao confirmed the BitTorrent token airdrop aimed at those who were unable to buy the tokens during the official sale.Due to overwhelming demands, Tron team generously agreed to do a small airdrop for people who tried to place orders, but was not successful in buying. Exact numbers will be published soon.— CZ Binance (@cz_binance) January 28, 2019Overall, the successful token sale serves as a morale booster for the crypto community, which hasn’t seen in a strong ICO in months.

349,CryptoSlate,Putting SubstratumNode v0.4.2 to the Test,Brian Li,1548758400.0,"A Substratum brand ambassador tested the latest SubstratumNode v0.4.2 release, showing outstanding speed and performance. CryptoSlate replicated these tests and was not able to achieve the same results.We received a complaint that this article was defamatory and contained factually incorrect information. We took down the article temporarily to scrutinize and assess these claims. After further review, the CryptoSlate team determined that the article is indeed factual and consequently not defamatory. However, we have made a few changes and corrections to add additional evidence to some of the claims made.On Jan. 10th, Substratum released v0.4.2 of SubstratumNode, a software product designed to circumvent Internet censorship by routing network traffic through a network of nodes. Substratum is similar to Tor, in that both products route traffic through a network of distributed nodes to give users more privacy and anonymity. The big difference is that Substratum does not require a dedicated web browser, and also allows nodes to earn SUB tokens by routing traffic.The release of SubstratumNode v0.4.2, which includes key decentralization features, represents a milestone achievement for Substratum. Upon the update, Substratum enthusiasts have launched nodes around the world to test the performance of the network, and so did we.In previous versions of SubstratumNode, network traffic routes were linear and a single node going offline would render a route useless. With the release of SubstratumNode v0.4.2, the network is now capable of ‘self-healing’ damaged routes by intelligently accounting for offline nodes and “new routes will omit any inactive nodes.” Self-healing is made possible via the network’s “gossip” technology, which automatically alerts an offline node’s connected neighbor nodes so that future requests are not routed to the offline node.The implementation of gossip technology has also allowed Substratum to take its first step towards legitimate decentralization. According to Substratum, the previous v0.4.1 release “required nodes to bootstrap from a single centralized entity to be in the same neighborhood.” A bootstrap node is effectively a centralized database that contains information about other nodes on the Substratum network and how to connect to them. In v0.4.2, nodes can be bootstrapped from any node on the network by gossiping, and a dedicated centralized bootstrap node is no longer needed to join the Substratum network.Substratum’s Community Response to v0.4.2Despite Substratum’s recent history of product development delays, the community’s response to the release of SubstratumNode v0.4.2 has been positive. In addition to launching a SubstratumNode test community which has attracted over eighty members, Substratum ambassador “Bastiaan” has taken the initiative to set up a decentralized neighborhood consisting of twenty-three nodes “around the globe.”Speedtest with 17 nodes neighborhood through the substratum network! Imagine when the whole world tunes in! #Substratum @SubstratumNet #cryptocurrency #netneutrality pic.twitter.com/5FP6G8vZFk— Bastiaan (@bastiaan007) January 13, 2019In a follow-up tweet, Bastiaan shared a screenshot of a “speed test with 17 nodes through the Substratum network.” The screenshot, which was retweeted by Substratum CMO Christian Pope, shows an impressive 347.14Mb/s download speed and 9 ms ping time. If you’re not familiar with the term “ping time,” it is the amount of time it takes for a computer to receive a response after sending a request–similar to the wait time between ordering a package from Amazon and having it delivered to your doorstep.An average ping time between Amsterdam and Paris is approximately 19 ms, while a long-distance transpacific ping between Los Angeles and Tokyo can often exceed 200 ms. By design, SubstratumNode routes traffic through one or more nodes, or hops, before reaching the destination. Thus, Bastiaan’s claim of achieving a 9 ms ping time through a decentralized network of nodes raises questions. On Jan. 14th, CryptoSlate contacted Bastiaan via Twitter and email to discuss his test configuration. Bastiaan did not respond until this article was posted.CryptoSlate Puts SubstratumNode v0.4.2 to the TestThis is not to say SubstratumNode doesn’t work–it does. To prove this, we performed two tests to gauge the speed of the network. For the first test, we used four nodes in the same location. While we experienced network timeouts when trying to download files over 20MB in size, smaller files were downloaded successfully at speeds up to 500KB/s.After establishing a successful baseline in our first test, our second test introduced geography into the equation by routing traffic through a decentralized network of nodes in Singapore, Bangalore, Frankfurt, New York City, Toronto, and San Francisco. For this test, we used a popular service called Speedtest.net to measure network speed and ping time.Following the conclusion of our second test, we were able to confirm that traffic originating from San Francisco was routed through the Substratum network and exited through our Frankfurt node with a ping time of 2585 ms. Since the average ping time between San Francisco and Frankfurt is 146 ms, the high ping time we observed was likely due to SubstratumNode routing traffic through one or more additional nodes before exiting at Frankfurt. Finally, we successfully downloaded a 3KB image file, which took 13 seconds to complete.To see the technical step-by-step tests that CryptoSlate performed, read the supplementary article here.Differing ResultsOverall, the results of our tests are not consistent with those performed by Substratum ambassador Bastiaan. With our six-node setup, we were unable to register a ping time of less than 2500 ms, while Bastiaan was able to achieve a 9 ms ping time through a network of seventeen nodes. Similarly, our image download registered an effective speed of 0.17 KB/s, while Bastiaan was able to stream a YouTube video through the Substratum network–a task that requires a download speed that is at least 1,800x faster.Getting Rick rolled through the Substratum network #neighborhood #Substratum #NetNeutrality @SubstratumNet pic.twitter.com/16PBlQri0E— Bastiaan (@bastiaan007) January 14, 2019Bastiaan’s tweet depicts a YouTube video accompanied by SubstratumNode logging data in the background. In order to conduct an honest performance test, it’s crucial to show that traffic is being routed through SubstratumNode by subverting DNS using the included utility–a step that is clearly documented in our test videos.Bastiaan claims the following about subverting his DNS:“My DNS was subverted, you can clearly see the command prompt getting replies from other nodes.”With the above said, it’s important to note that SubstratumNode logs data even when traffic is not being routed through the node. Based on the visible replies from his command prompt which doesn’t explicitly show ‘sudo dns_utility subvert’ being run, it is not clear whether Bastiaan’s DNS was subverted.Think of two railroad tracks, A and B, with an identical origin and destination. Track A is a direct route, while Track B winds and curves through many stops before arriving at the destination. In this scenario, the train represents network traffic and a railroad switch is the DNS subversion utility. From the destination’s perspective, it is impossible to know which route the train took without knowing if the railroad switch was triggered. Similarly, a Substratum network performance test that doesn’t show DNS being subverted is incomplete and inconclusive.This important step of subverting DNS appears to have been omitted in all of Bastiaan’s v0.4.2 test videos. Furthermore, several members in Bastiaan’s test group have expressed difficulty achieving usable speeds through SubstratumNode. In response, Bastiaan said that he “also have often time outs”–a sentiment that is never expressed in his public-facing tweets.The Future of SubstratumNodeOne thing is certain—SubstratumNode is a working product in the sense that it’s possible to route traffic through a network of nodes. The primary concern now is the speed of the network when routing traffic through geographically distributed nodes.Substratum is being marketed as the “foundation of the decentralized web,” and CEO Justin Tabb has spoken on many occasions about the merits of decentralization.SubstratumNode’s progress is exciting and the introduction of self-healing in v0.4.2 is an important first step to decentralizing the network. However, based on the team’s roadmap which includes monetizing the network with the SUB token, implementing secure data encryption, and building an infrastructure of supernodes with a “$5 million [partner] investment,” it appears that a version of SubstratumNode that is suitable for mainstream adoption is still a ways off.Updated Jan. 30, 12:00 UTC: Added comments from Bastiaan; added additional links to primary evidence.Updated Jan. 31, 20:10 UTC: A third-party requested that we remove identifying information from one of the parties in the article.

351,CryptoSlate,Storm Play Launches Long Awaited iOS App for Microtasks,Priyeshu Garg,1548043680.0,"The popular gamified microtask platform, StormX, has launched their long-awaited iOS app. To celebrate the milestone, Storm Play account holders have the opportunity to win prizes worth $10,000 in BTC, STORM, BNB, or ETH via the company’s Twitter competition.Cryptocurrency FreelancingStorm Play leverages blockchain to “empower the global workforce.” Storm Play lets users earn STORM tokens, bitcoin, and ether for trying games, products, services and performing other microtasks—similar to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk program.The Storm Play platform brings together Storm Makers and Storm Players. Storm Makers include sellers, advertisers, and companies who are looking for the services of freelancers to complete tasks of different levels. Storm Players include consumers, viewers, and freelancers who complete these tasks.Storm has an in-app ledger system for rewards called bolts. The tasks by Storm Players are rewarded with bolts. These tokens can be redeemed for STORM Tokens or sold and exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.Since the Storm Tokens is compatible with all ERC20 token cryptocurrency wallets, they can be stored in hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger as well as in cloud wallets like MyEtherWallet and MetaMask.The Long Awaited iOS LaunchImage courtesy of Stormx.ioUp until now, Storm Play has only been available via Android and has kept iOS users waiting for almost a year. A recent announcement shows that Storm Play is now finally available on iOS.CryptoSlate reached out to Storm CEO Simon Yu for comment. He had the following to say about the launch:“It took longer than we estimated but we’re excited to launch our iOS platform. We started back in 2014 and the environment was very similar. Right after Mt. Gox and Silk Road incidents people were afraid to buy Bitcoin but the technology was still really interesting. Our platform (Storm Play) allows people all over the world to be able to get their hands on cryptocurrency without having to risk their money. That includes the 1.7B people currently without a bank account and it’s exciting to have the ability to tap into a new group of people.”Potential RewardsTo celebrate the launch, Storm is facilitating a Twitter competition for those interested in trying Storm Play. The planned campaign promises $10,000 delivered in BTC, STORM, or ETH a lucky winner, assuming they’re willing to jump through some social media hoops.So far, Storm has made some tangible progress in terms of gaining market recognition. After raising over $30 million in its ICO in December of 2017, the company has made solid progress towards improving their app and expanding its user base.The simple premise around Storm Play is attractive, and the campaign is likely to highlight that. Already boasting 2.4 million downloads and 250,000 active users, Storm is positioned to continue to gain traction through the bear market.The future looks promising for Storm, or at least according to CIOReview in its “20 Most Promising Blockchain Solution Providers of 2018.”The contest for the $10,000 prize is set to conclude Feb. 4th at 17:00 PST, with winners, announced three business days afterward.

352,CryptoSlate,Interconnecting Blockchain Project ICON Makes a Push Towards Decentralizing Its Nodes,Brian Li,1547875380.0,"ICON recently announced its major decentralization initiative. The plan will elect twenty-two node operators that will produce blocks, verify transactions, and participate in consensus.History of ICONICON aims to design an “interconnecting blockchain network.” ICON (ICX) is engineering a solution to connect independent blockchains without the use of third-party intermediaries. This is done by connecting a community to other communities through ICON Republic and Citizen Nodes. By connecting siloed blockchains, ICON aims to become the “largest” network of blockchains in existence.ICX, the project’s token, is currently ranked 43rd by market capitalization at $116 million. Each ICX, at the time of writing, is trading for $0.245 per token. According to Track ICO, the project raised $42.75 million through its ICO at an offer price of $0.11 per token.Launch of Public RepresentativesOn Jan. 17th, ICON announced the opening of its Public Representative (P-Rep) application process. A P-Rep is a community-elected node operator that facilitates consensus on the blockchain, performing activities like verifying transactions and voting on policy proposals.The application process concludes in September 2019 and will be followed by an on-chain election where all ICON community members can vote for their candidate of choice. Following the election, the ICON network will move into its first phase of decentralization with 22 elected community P-Reps.Understanding ICON ConsensusICONSENSUS is ICON’s journey to attempted mainstream adoption through network decentralization. The cryptocurrency plans to implement incentives to support dApp development and other ecosystem-building projects.The on-chain election and onboarding of the 22 P-Reps is the first step in this process. Subsequently, the community plans to establish Ecosystem Expansion Projects (EEPs) and dApp Booster Programs (DBPs) to “allocate a portion of block rewards to specific decentralized application[s].”ICON also plans to hold another election process. The cryptocurrency plans to use participants called Community Representatives (C-Reps) to act as liaisons for external blockchains that wish to connect to the ICON blockchain conglomerate.Following network decentralization, ICON’s goal is to establish a governance structure that mirrors a representative democracy, where ICON holders can delegate votes to candidates of their choice.Community and Enterprise Focused?ICON also made a recent announcement of ICON LAP100, an ICON Loopchain Alliance Program, in an effort to develop “enterprise-specialized blockchain solutions with… companies and startups in various fields.” The South Korean blockchain company has expressed on multiple occasions its drive for enterprise-level blockchain integrations. Consequently, the project is screening for technical prowess and consistency for its node operators to achieve this aim.According to ICON’s yellow paper, a P-Rep should be a community member “who has made a significant contribution to the ICON network” and who “shall meet the minimum technical specifications necessary to generate blocks in the ICON network.”The P-Rep application highlights the importance of these two statements. In the P-Rep application, candidates are required to submit a “detailed proposal” on how they plan to “enhance the ICON network” along with the specifications of the computer hardware they plan to use to produce blocks and verify transactions.With consumer and big business use in mind, it’s understandable that ICON has placed a high emphasis on consistent block production, which is directly correlated to network uptime. However, producing a cohort of conscientious, engaged, and reliable block producers is a tall order for ICON.Applying to Become an ICON P-RepFor those interested in participating, or simply learning more about the process, visit ICON’s recently created community portal. Those applying should be prepared to provide a proposal containing team member information, technical server specifications, and a pitch on how the team plans to “enhance the ICON network.” These details will be made publicly available through the community portal for all ICON members to access.Since its inception, ICON has made progress as a blockchain project. It has secured a number of promising collaborations with Samsung, LINE, SK-Planet, and the Korea Customs Service. Furthermore, it has the backing of some well-known partners including Pantera Capital and Kinetic Capital, and it has expanded to 142 team members worldwide while boasting strong ties to the global enterprise sector.Now, it has also kicked off 2019 on a positive note with progress towards greater decentralization. That said, the success rate of blockchain projects in aggregate is still slim. If ICON can maintain its momentum, maybe it can be one of the exceptions.   ICON 24 Mar at 6:49 am UTC$0.24  1.78%ICON, currently ranked #44 by market cap, is up 1.78% over the past 24 hours.

353,CryptoSlate,ICO Firms Paid Themselves $24 Billion Absent of Accountability or Much Effort,Shaurya Malwa,1547714940.0,"A BitMEX report highlights the egregiousness of the ICO craze of 2017. Cryptocurrency companies were able to raise millions absent of accountability and with little work, and at the expense of likely unsophisticated buyers.The scathing report, released on Jan. 16th by BitMEX, on the ICO market in 2017-18 concluded token startups raised over $24 billion during the period. These startups cumulatively “paid” over $1.5 billion to team members and saw the total value of their holdings reduced to under $5 billion as a result of the bear market.The piece is third in a series of ICO-focused research papers. While earlier reports analyzed the interrelationships and treasury accounts of all projects turning to the controversial method of fundraising, the latest tracks $24 billion worth of tokens that teams issued and awarded themselves in 2017-18.While BitMEX adjusted the price values of the tokens to account for cycles in the market, it states the holdings could have been worth over $80 billion during the cryptocurrency market’s peak in December of 2017. With highs in mind, token projects totaled over $70 billion in unrealized losses—equivalent to the GDP of Myanmar.Based on illiquid spot prices, current holdings for ICO teams are worth roughly $5 billion. The research refers to these holdings as:“[It is] money they essentially got from nothing, depending on one’s view. At the same time, the teams may have realized gains of US$1.5 billion by selling tokens, based on coins leaving team address clusters.”Easiest Route to Becoming a MillionaireBitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes called out teams looking to raise huge amounts of capital through ICOs who at the same time make no meaningful progress on their projects. The research added that $13 billion in profits was “easily” realized by crypto teams, with “very little work, accountability, or transparency.”When you create poo poo out of thin air, gravity is a bitch. Check out the latest report from BitMEX Research on ICOs. https://t.co/SdlZ7hreTD— Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) January 16, 2019Overall, teams profited by selling ether tokens raised from the market—or even issuing project tokens to themselves. Keep in mind that the computed dollar values are “gross estimates,” as the market has far from sufficient liquidity to support billion-dollar sales of obscure tokens.Breaking Down the NumbersOf all teams, the peer-to-peer capital markets project Veritaseum (VERI) issued the highest amount—over $4.8 billion worth—of its tokens to team members. Smart city project Noah Coin (NOAH) followed closely, with $4.4 billion issued to team members. Third in line is digital ecosystem financier Kin (KIN), which issued $1 billion worth of tokens to its team.All values for the above mentioned were based on prices at the time of coin issuance. However, if price data from Jan. 19 is considered, Verisatuem and Kin have faced losses of $3.2 billion and $700 million, respectively.The most unfortunate teams seem to be those from SALT and IoT Chain. Both projects saw a 97 percent decline in “proportional loss of value,” if data from team-controlled address clusters are considered. Other projects losing over 90 percent of their value in this metric include Arcblock (ARC), Metal (MTL), and Po.et (POE)—three of the arguably most ‘hyped’ projects of 2017.Read: BitMEX CEO Denies Allegations of Trading Against CustomersData suggests team members paid in Huobi Tokens (HT) enjoyed a massive payday. An analysis of coins transferred out of team-controlled address clusters concluded holders sold over $366 million worth in HT tokens. Interestingly, most of this could have been on Huobi’s exchange platform, where the HT is provided as an exchange pair for several cryptocurrencies. Similarly, Qash (QASH) members made over $175 million and presumably sold its tokens on the project’s own exchange.Meanwhile, an analysis of team-controlled address clusters from Verisateum and Binance (BNB) suggests team members have “strong hands” when it comes to holding their payments. Verisateum employees have yet to move $1.5 billion worth of tokens from their wallets, and $447 million BNB tokens also remain locked in team wallets. HT and QASH holders join this list, with $248 million and $140 million held by its employees, respectively.Insight for the Next BubbleThe research and data are grim for investors expecting another ICO frenzy:“The ICO cycle now appears to be dying down to some extent and it’s much harder to raise funds than it was in late 2017. But with so much money made and lost, the events of 2017 and early 2018 are not likely to be quickly forgotten.”Yet, in hindsight, it is clear that 2017 had elements of a speculative mania. Hopefully, lessons learned from the last cycle can mitigate fund misallocation during the next bull market.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis, Scams     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

355,CryptoSlate,Ethereum Classic Network Loses More than $1 Million In 51% Attack,Priyeshu Garg,1547004780.0,"Ethereum Classic, a fork of Ethereum, was hacked using a 51 percent attack on the coin’s blockchain, with more than $1 million worth of ETC stolen so far.Ethereum Classic Remains Under SiegeA less popular offshoot of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency is currently in its third day of the siege, as it was hacked using a 51 percent attack on Jan. 5th.The hack was first noticed by Coinbase, which issued a statement on Jan. 7th saying that it had found “deep reorganizations” of the Ethereum Classic blockchain. Anthony Lusardi, U.S. director of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative, confirmed the news to Bloomberg on Jan. 8th, saying that 12 instances of double spending of Ethereum Classic tokens were noticed so far.Coinbase has since halted all transactions involving Ethereum Classic, whose value has dropped more than 7 percent following the news of the attack. Kraken soon followed suit, blocking all transactions involving the cryptocurrency.Mark Nesbitt, a security engineer at Coinbase, told WIRED that the exchange was “very confident” that the double spends are a result of someone taking over 51 percent of the Ethereum Classic network.Hack Not a Result of ASIC TestingEthereum Classic still hasn’t commented on the issue or revealed how it plans on handling the hack. The lack of comment from the coin’s developers caused a slew of misinformation to go around, with some media reporting that there was no double spending associated with the attack.Sources claimed that the hack was a result of the new 1.4 GH/s ETHash ASICs, which caused a public outcry to ban these chips both on the Ethereum Classic and Ethereum networks.Coinbase found that 219,500 ETC, worth around $1.1 million, has been stolen so far, which removed any doubt that the hack was a result of ASIC testing. The analysis revealed that the attack started on Jan. 5th and lasted until Jan. 8th, making it one of the longest 51 percent attack ever recorded. Of the attacks, the longest attack lasted about 30 minutes and went 123 blocks deep into the network, according to Coinbase.The ongoing Ethereum Classic attack could be a wake-up call for more popular cryptocurrencies, Forbes reported. Nir Kabessa, President of Blockchain at Columbia University, told the publication that Bitcoin and Ethereum should consider a “deep re-evaluation of proof-of-work’s security profile” in order to avoid similar attacks.Mati Greenspan, a Senior Market Analyst at eToro, believes that such attacks on more widely used cryptocurrencies are implausible. He warned that smaller cryptocurrencies with a lower hashrate are at a much higher risk of a 51 percent attack.The 51% attack on the Ethereum Classic network serves as a reminder for one of the key limitations of the decentralized blockchain network vulnerability to 51% attacks, especially for smaller altcoins.Posted In: Altcoins, Hacks     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

356,CryptoSlate,"Ethereum, TRON, Iota Lead in Peformance Adjusted for Risk by Sharpe Ratio, Bitcoin Underperforms",Mitchell Moos,1546661220.0,"Ethereum, TRON, and Iota have outperformed most other major cryptocurrencies by the 30-day Sharpe ratio, a measure developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe to evaluate the return of an investment relative to its risk. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s performance was dismal.Within the last 30 days, the market has experienced a robust recovery after bottoming out in December. One indicator, the Sharpe ratio, calculates the performance of an investment adjusted for the risk-free interest rate per unit of volatility.To calculate the Sharpe ratio, first, the risk-free rate is typically determined using U.S. Treasury Bills as a zero-risk benchmark. Then, over a given period of time, the rate of return of an investment is calculated. The risk-free rate is subtracted from the rate of return of the investment to produce the amount of excess return. Finally, the excess return is divided by the standard deviation (volatility) to produce the Sharpe ratio.(Average Cryptocurrency Return – Risk-Free Rate) / Cryptocurrency Standard DeviationThe greater the returns over the risk-free return, the higher the Sharpe ratio. More consistent returns over time also produce a higher Sharpe ratio. Meanwhile, a negative ratio indicates that the return on investment was lower than the risk-free interest rate in a given period.For comparison, U.S. Treasury Bills have a Sharpe ratio of zero. The S&P 500, an index of stocks from the largest 500 U.S. companies, had a rolling 12-month Sharpe ratio of approximately 1.0 over the last 25 years.Chart courtesy of 6 MeridianUnderstandably, cryptocurrency has a very low—and sometimes even negative—Sharpe ratio because of its extreme volatility. The chart below shows the lifetime volatility of bitcoin’s daily rate of return relative to the S&P 500:Original analysis by CryptoSlate. Scrutinize our data on GitHubThe chart emphasizes the extreme levels of volatility experienced by bitcoin, even when compared to a moderately volatile index, such as the S&P 500.On Jan. 4th, LongHash calculated the 30-day Sharpe ratio for various cryptocurrencies:Chart courtesy of LongHashEthereum and Iota generated Sharpe ratios of 0.124 and 0.127, respectively. TRON lead the way with a ratio of 0.169. Over the last month, Bitcoin had a dismal ratio of -0.0722, indicating that U.S. Treasury Bills outperformed the cryptocurrency in the last 30 days. These figures have little to no bearing on how the cryptocurrencies in question will perform in the following months.Whether the Sharpe ratio has any relevance for evaluating the merits of a cryptocurrency is another matter entirely. The new asset class is new enough and volatile enough that the ratio may not provide any useful information—but we’ll let the analysts in our audience make the final decision.Posted In: Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA, Tron, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

358,CryptoSlate,Humor: New Cryptocurrency Aims to Reduce Energy Consumption from Christmas Lights,Mitchell Moos,1545612840.0,"Americans and their Christmas lights consume a staggering amount of energy. For December alone, these glowing ornaments consumed 4.5 terawatt-hours of electricity, more than the annual consumption of Laos. Fortunately, the new Festivus ICO is looking to reinvent Christmas spirit.Problems with BitcoinOne of the major problems with Bitcoin is how much energy it takes to maintain the network. Proof of work mining is costly. Estimates by CryptoSlate put the number around 29 terawatt-hours a year, as much energy as the entire country of Morocco.Yet, Americans also use an absurd amount of electricity to prove that they are more spirited than their neighbors. If people had to juice their holiday-glands for the entire year, it would consume nearly 54 terawatt-hours, or almost twice that of Bitcoin mining. And, that’s just to impress the neighbors. There has to be a better way.Introducing FestivusThe innovative ICO Festivus (FEST) aims to address the waste around Christmas lights by reinventing holiday spirit. Using its Festivity Coin, holders can deterministically prove that they have more holiday cheer than their neighbors.Instead of proof of work, FEST uses a new proof of festivity algorithm (PoF). PoF allows holders to stake cryptocurrency tokens in return for donations made directly to holiday charities, such as Toys for Tots, Operation Christmas Child, and Make-A-Wish Foundation.And, unlike ordinary Christmas lights, stakers are given the GPS coordinates of all other FEST nodes within a 50-mile radius, allowing holders to out-do their neighbors without the tangle of holiday lights.So, if you’re not into Hanukkah, Solstice, or Christmas, then thankfully for the rest of us, there is Festivus. Now you can stop hassling with holiday lights and put some of those Christmas Rally gains into FEST.Posted In: Altcoins, ICOs, Mining, Opinion     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

359,CryptoSlate,Zcash Mining Mysteriously Spikes Despite Low Profitability,Mitchell Moos,1545290400.0,"Zcash’s network hash rate has mysteriously spiked by over 40 percent since Dec. 10th. It is unknown what is causing the spike, but it could indicate a growing ASIC presence on Zcash, or, more likely, that a large mining conglomerate is returning to the fray.According to information from BitInfoCharts, from Dec. 10th to 18th, Zcash difficulty has jumped from 2.1GH/s to 3 GH/s, a 42 percent increase. Mining difficulty has adjusted accordingly, causing some concern among Equihash miners.Chart courtesy of BitInfoCharts.comThe event is curious, considering that mining Zcash on the Equihash algorithm is likely one of the least profitable coins to mine, according to comparisons from WhatToMine. Zcash is only 80 percent as profitable as the optimal choice, Horizen (ZEN), as of writing.It’s unknown what is causing the rapid increase in network hash rate. It could be the proliferation of a more advanced ASIC, or, more likely, an industrial miner returning to Zcash mining.With Zcash comprising roughly 92 percent of all Equihash mining, a large miner entering any other coin would rapidly increase mining difficulty and result in diminished profits. When mining Zcash however, even a supermassive miner can enter the network without entirely disrupting the difficulty level.Posted In: Zcash, Altcoins, Mining     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

360,CryptoSlate,"The Unflappening, Bitcoin Cash Leaves Litecoin to Roost",Mitchell Moos,1545276000.0,"Bitcoin Cash has reclaimed its position above Litecoin, by market capitalization, following meteoric gains in sync with the latest market upswing. Roger Ver can once more claim crowing rights from Charlie Lee.LTC enthusiasts have eagerly awaited the coin’s ascension above BCH, going so far as to build a website dedicated to monitoring the event. And, Briefly on Dec. 14th, Litecoin had overtaken its rival Bitcoin Cash as prophesized.Bitcoin Cash was battered following the BCH Hash Wars, allowing Litecoin to gradually overtake the weary coin. When Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin S.V. split, it had lost much of its value as the community and price were divvied between the two forks.Recently, however, Bitcoin Cash has seen a resurgence. The cryptocurrency made a 70 percent rebound since Dec. 15th, surging from $82 to $140.What’s Flappening?Charlie Lee’s Embodiment as the ChikunThe ‘Flappening’ is a play on words on the previously anticipated “flippening,” where Ethereum would overtake Bitcoin by market capitalization.Although such an event never happened, Litecoin enthusiasts adopted the terminology by embodying its founder, Charlie Lee, into the term. Lee’s online nickname and persona as the ‘Chikun’ makes the vernacular appropriate.Hatched RivalsThe rivalry between LTC and BCH is both functional and ideological. Functionally, both cryptos aim to act as a medium of exchange, offering to act as an improvement upon Bitcoin’s role as a “store of value.”Both coins diverge, however, in their interactions with the Bitcoin community. Litecoin markets itself as a complement to Bitcoin, with some even calling Litecoin the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold.”In some instances, Litecoin acts as a test network for upgrades before they go live on Bitcoin’s core network, providing as a proving ground for the more conservative Bitcoin protocol. Due to these synergies, both communities tend to interact harmoniously.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash claims that it is the version of ‘Bitcoin’ that anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto had envisioned, as peer-to-peer electronic cash.To further that end, Bitcoin Cash has engaged in a marketing campaign leaving some users confused. BCH purchased the bitcoin.com domain name and brought its presence to the r/Bitcoin Reddit community. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts found the activities unsavory.Recently, Bitcoin Cash has been able to take full advantage of the market upswing and recover from the recent fork. Now that Bitcoin Cash has comfortably reclaimed its place as number four by market cap—with Litecoin sitting at eighth—time will tell whether Bitcoin Cash remains unflappable.Posted In: Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Altcoins, Culture, People     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

361,CryptoSlate,Cardano Awakens: Heavy-Hitting Updates and Foundation Restructuring,Mitchell Moos,1544836500.0,"Charles Hoskinson describes Cardano’s 1.4 as the “most significant update to the Cardano ecosystem to date,” with the update featuring a host of high-caliber performance and functionality upgrades to the software. In addition to the update, IOHK has made rapid progress in other areas of the organization, including a restructuring of the Cardano Foundation following the resignation of chairman Michael Parsons.Cardano 1.4 is an enormous overhaul of Cardano. The update signals the completion of Cardano’s ‘Byron’ phase of development, and based on comments from Charles Hoskinson (the CEO of the organization responsible for developing Cardano, IOHK) the update could indicate that Cardano is coming out of its software-developer-induced isolationism.CryptoSlate reached out to IOHK and is scheduled to interview Charles Hoskinson for additional comments on Cardano’s upcoming features.There are several important upgrades slated for the 1.4 upgrade. These upgrades include optimized block storage, a Cardano test network, full wallet support for Linux, and support of the Rust programming language. The update is scheduled to go live on Dec. 18th.After seven release candidates and a huge amount of QA work, I'm pleased to announce that our best effort release date for Cardano 1.4 is December 18th. Daedalus users will get an in-client update notification next week. Thanks everyone for your patience and support— Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 14, 2018Optimized Block StorageOne of the most important updates for 1.4 is more streamlined storage for the blockchain. At the moment, a user needs to store roughly 1.5 million files to house the entire Cardano blockchain. Moreover, the storage requirements increase by an additional file with every new block produced.The new update drops this number substantially, allowing users to get the same functionality with a mere 200 files. Furthermore, users will now only need to store a file for each epoch—a snapshot of the current set of miners taken approximately every 20 seconds, further reducing the amount of storage space needed.More efficient storage means more actions can be done ‘locally.’ If the blockchain is stored locally on someone’s computer they can access it much more quickly (instead of accessing it slowly from the Cardano network). This will produce performance improvements for things that use the locally stored blockchain, such as wallet restoration, proof-of-stake mining, and synchronization with the online blockchain network.Cardano TestnetThe Cardano test network (testnet) is a version of the Cardano blockchain that is one software update ahead of the real Cardano blockchain. The testnet is said to have the same functionality, integration capabilities, and properties of Cardano’s real blockchain.This version of the Cardano blockchain allows developers to quickly test and run code without risking substantial amounts of Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, Ada. Ultimately, the feature means more reliable software upgrades for Cardano’s main blockchain.Users can also benefit from the testnet. Any time there is a wallet upgrade to Daedalus (Cardano’s primary wallet), users can familiarize themselves in a test environment without risking real Ada.Daedelus for LinuxLinux is the most widely used open-source computer operating system. Linux powers many of the world’s phones, servers, and supercomputers. Furthermore, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have a tendency to use Linux.Daedalus is Cardano’s primary crypto wallet. The wallet has been available to public beta Linux users since Cardano issued 1.1. That said, after extensive testing and improvement, the full release of Daedalus for Linux is scheduled for the 1.4 release. The update will bring greater functionality and ease-of-use for Linux users wishing to transact in Ada or interact with the Cardano blockchain.Supporting the Rust Programming LanguageRust is a low-level programming language used for things like computer chips, industrial machines, and other embedded systems. Rust is commonly used for ‘performance-critical’ code. The main selling-point of Rust is its built-in ‘safe code’ features, which prevent programmers from committing critical errors. The language is often compared to, and sometimes used in place of, C and C++.According to IOHK, third-party developers who make iOS, Android, and web applications often use Rust. In the 1.4 update, Cardano will implement rust as an open-source sandbox that will allow developers to integrate and build their own products on top of the platform, including products for mobile devices. This would “further decentralize the ecosystem” by stimulating open-source development.At the moment, the project comprises a command-line interface wallet and a software development kit. The Rust Github repository is currently open to code contributions from the community.Cleaning Up the Cardano FoundationMichael Parsons, the former CEO of the Cardano Foundation, has resigned following months of tumult between IOHK, Emurgo, and the Foundation. Between the three branches of Cardano’s governing bodies, the Foundation was tasked with driving adoption, releasing news, conducting evangelism, and marketing the project.One incident escalated to the point where the community alleged that the branch failed in most of its responsibilities, saying that the Foundation “failed to build and lead a competent organization.Charles Hoskinson and Ken Komada from IOHK and Emurgo agreed.In a comment on the resignation, Hoskinson said that the community is “waking up the foundation and getting it where it was supposed to go,” a clear indication of movement in the right direction. Moreover, he cites in-fighting with the Cardano Foundation as one of the reasons why the marketing of the project has suffered. Now that the issues are getting resolved, users should expect Cardano’s marketing presence to improve.Hoskinson is currently looking to introduce the concept of “Cardano Hubs,” community groups that come together to evangelize and get people excited about the project. The CEO mentions setting up hubs in places like Africa, South America, Asia, and the United States.In the Development PipelineFollowing 1.4, IOHK, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation are looking to introduce a flurry of heavy-hitting features in the next upgrade cycle, code-named ‘Shelley.’ Some of these features include:Related: Cardano (ADA) Releases Project Shelley UpdateA full roll-out of network decentralizationTrezor and Ledger Nano S supportNFC (touchless) debit cardsFull multi-signature supportSide-chain supportAnd a host of other goodiesThe above lineup of features is scheduled to go live in Q1 of 2019.Outlook for CardanoCardano’s 1.4 and Shelley updates run contrary to people’s perceptions of the project. Some in the Cardano community calling it a group of academics engaging in “computer science masturbation.”However, if the organization is able to deliver on its ambitious promises for Q1, that might change. The updates may bring on a new cohort of enthusiasts who are tired of the hype-first-product-later style of marketing which is common in the industry.After operating without much publicity, the awakening of the Foundation—combined with a string of hard-hitting updates—could take Cardano to the forefront of the crypto platforms. Whether it will rival the likes of Ethereum, TRON, or EOS is another debate.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

362,CryptoSlate,Binance Chooses NEO’s Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance for its BNB Chain,Shaurya Malwa,1544495400.0,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by market cap, will utilize the sophisticated Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) for its upcoming Binance Chain product, as seen on a Youtube video released on December 4, 2018.Building a Robust ProductFirst revealed in a tweet last week, Binance Chain is a native blockchain that strives to offer a highly-scalable distributed ledger that can be used to build products and issue digital tokens.#Binance is pushing for blockchain adoption and doing many things to help advancement of the industry. E.g. we will have the Binance chain ready in the coming months, on which millions of projects can easily issue tokens. @cz_binance @ForbesAsia #ForbesBlockchain pic.twitter.com/0pc0r1lXd2— Binance (@binance) December 4, 2018Binance announced the product at a Forbes Asia event held in the first week of December. CEO Changpeng Zhao, popularly known by his initials CZ, spoke at the “Decrypting Blockchain for Business” seminar while unveiling the offering.Now, the company has confirmed that Binance Chain will utilize a dBFT-based consensus mechanism, with the company’s upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) being the first to deploy the sophisticated system.Perhaps the most popular project deploying such a mechanism is NEO, the world’s 18th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance ExplainedFor the uninitiated, a dBFT framework is an iteration of the popularly used proof-of-stake mechanism used by cryptocurrencies such as EOS and Peercoin.Unfortunately, the latter blockchains require wallets to be connected to the internet at all times, making them a ripe target for hackers. Besides, achieving true consensus in a decentralized system on the basis of wealth distribution and delegation is a complicated task, and—as observed in the controversies surrounding EOS—could result in an unfair network.The problem is amplified when several parties are involved in a network crash. Without singular consensus, it’s difficult to determine which parties’ components failed and caused the issue.The term “Byzantine Fault” is derived from a famous Game theory fallacy called “Byzantine Generals Problem,” where all actors must agree on a concerted strategy to avoid a catastrophic system failure, but some of the system’s participants are unreliable; signaling that it is functioning properly, when in fact it is faulty.However, a dBFT system takes into consideration this fallacy and ascertains that as long as two-thirds of the network’s participants remain truthful, the one-third of ‘bad actors’ are eliminated from affecting the network’s final decision.Binance Selects dBTF ConsensusCurrently, it is unclear why Binance chose a dBFT-based consensus mechanism, but if the exchange’s impressive plans of reaching global expansion are considered, the operation of a worldwide public blockchain would require a high tolerance to bad actors who try to maliciously affect the network.After untold hours of development and research the worlds largest exchange #binance has chosen to use the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) Consensus Algorithm for their new $BNB chain. This is the same consensus Algorithm that $NEO pioneered. Great reassurance for NEO pic.twitter.com/FcNjd7hYK2— xenzor (@xenzor1) December 8, 2018Meanwhile, CZ added at the event that Binance is striving hard to reach a fundamental “payment adoption increase,” and “pushing really hard into that space” as the company pushes for its vision of digital asset decentralization.

363,CryptoSlate,NEO Foundation Seeking to Decentralize Four of Its Seven Nodes,Mitchell Moos,1544338200.0,"NEO has announced that it is looking to decentralize the nodes on its network. NEO Foundation, which currently runs five of the seven nodes on its system, is opening the process to applicants who wish to run one of these nodes.NEO is a smart contract blockchain platform and cryptocurrency that is designed to “build a scalable network of decentralized applications” using widely available programming languages. The Chinese-based platform is described as a major competitor to Ethereum.Decentralizing the NEO NetworkIn a press release sent to CryptoSlate on Dec. 5th, NEO Global Development (NGD) announced plans to decentralize its network through a “selection process,” encouraging third-party organizations to participate in the consensus mechanism for NEO.According to Peter Lin, Director of Research and Development at NGD:“NEO is embarking on its next phase, which will see far more public involvement in efforts of greater decentralization.”Much like other blockchains, consensus nodes validate blocks on the NEO network. Each node takes turns adding new blocks of transactions and information, maintaining the integrity of the blockchain ledger. Additionally, these nodes also enforce protocol decisions and implement updates to the networks, as well as setting standards such as network transaction fees.At the moment, five of the seven nodes are managed by the NEO Foundation. The remaining two are run by the Dutch telecom company KPN, and the NEO-focused development company City of Zion.In 2019, NEO stated that they are replacing four of its five consensus nodes with applicants who have “passed a screening process” and have completed a six month trial on the NEO test network.The company states that by the “end of 2019, it is possible that each consensus node… will be operated by a separate organization.” In a blog post, NEO states that it will “select candidates based on their qualifications and potential contributions to the NEO ecosystem.”According to that same blog post, the NEO Foundation intends to expand the number of decentralized nodes, at their discretion:“…after the first seven consensus nodes are selected, the next number of consensus nodes should be 10, then 13, and so forth. Once the seven existing consensus nodes are fully decentralized, the number of consensus nodes is likely to increase through additional selection cycles at the discretion of the NEO Foundation.”Ultimately, the organization asserts that it is committed to becoming more “decentralized and open”:“…the team will add other independent consensus nodes, demonstrating NEO’s commitment to becoming more decentralized and open.”There will be a “growing number of NEO token holders seeking to function as consensus nodes,” and that participation “plays a vital role… in the governance of NEO,” as stated in the press release.For those interested in applying, see the official resource: How to Become a NEO Consensus Node.Downtime ControversyThe decentralization process detailed above is important to the health of the NEO network, as the past network downtime has been an issue for the NEO blockchain.In one often-cited incident, NEO’s blockchain experienced an “outage” for two hours because of one of the seven nodes going offline. NEO described it as an unexpected “edge case.” One software engineer, Eric Wall, lambasted the organization on the matter over Twitter, garnering notice from industry figureheads such as Charlie Lee and Vlad Zamfir.Since the incident, the number of complaints around network delays has steadily declined, indicating that the company may have rectified these issues through software improvements.Token CentralizationIn addition to the control that the NEO Foundation exerts over its nodes, token ownership concentration is another point of criticism from some in the cryptocurrency community.At the cryptocurrency’s inception, 100 million tokens were created. Of that 100 million, 50 million are directly managed by NEO, the NEO Council, and its affiliates for the purposes of “long-term development.”The breakdown of ownership: 10 million are earmarked “motivate NEO developers and members of the NEO Council,” 10 million to “motivate developers in the NEO ecosystem,” 15 million are used to “cross-invest in other blockchain projects, which are owned by the NEO Council,” and 15 million are retained as contingency.At current prices, that gives the NEO Foundation, the NEO Council, and its affiliates control of over $326 million in funding.“As an increasing amount of NEO tokens held by the NEO Foundation are unlocked, they will flow into the market and add to the amount of NEO in circulation,” Lin noted.Over time, “as the NEO Foundation distributes tokens through ecosystem funding, the amount of influence it holds on the voting process is diminished,” according to the NEO blog. However, this will also put supply-side pressure on the token, potentially decreasing its value as more tokens enter circulation.Other Indications of Centralization?At the moment, the NEO Foundation provides funding to the City of Zion, NewEconoLabs, NEO St. Petersburg Competence Center, and NEO Research. To what extent each of these organizations are dependent on the NEO Foundation requires additional investigation.The level of control that the NEO Foundation exerts over the funding and maintenance of the network may raise questions about the decentralization of the platform. One critic went so far as to say “NEO is currently not a real cryptocurrency yet as it is still centralized.”However, the company appears to be making progress towards greater decentralization. As reaffirmed by Lin in the press release:“With an open ecosystem that allows organizations to launch and operate an independent node, NEO can accelerate its mission of creating a ‘smart economy’ powered by the blockchain.”Despite the critics, the move suggests that NEO is looking to overcome the issues surrounding its alleged centralization.Posted In: Neo, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Currently, the cryptocurrency is only compatible with the Brave browser.Today, Brendan Eich, the CEO of Brave Software, and the creator of the JavaScript programming language, announced that Brave would be adopted as the default browser for HTC’s new Exodus 1 blockchain-powered phone.We are very happy to have @Brave as default browser & to be working with HTC on their Exodus phone: https://t.co/J5WQrqODKa— BrendanEich (@BrendanEich) December 8, 2018HTC Exodus 1Based on its specifications, the HTC Exodus 1 seems like an ordinary phone: 6-inch display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset, and running Android 8.1. What makes the phone stand-out, however, is the suite of blockchain and cryptocurrency features built into the phone.For starters, each Exodus 1 is a node on HTC’s own blockchain network. Along with other integrations, the phone aims to allow users to securely store and trade cryptocurrency. The phone is also geared to support BTC, LTC, ETH, and ERC-721 Ethereum crypto-collectibles through its Zion wallet integration.Phil Chen, HTC’s ‘chief decentralization officer,’ and the phone’s designer, mentioned that the current iteration of the phone is the “high-end” version meant for beta testing the concept. If successful, the company plans to release a “low-end” version available to the general public.According to Chen, one of the purposes of the phone is to eventually “target the 1-2 billion unbanked people in the world [and provide them access to financial services].” Moreover, “even the United Nations is interested in that.”That said, the phone is a “beta” product. Considering the track record of many other blockchain-related products, the first version of the phone may also feature a less-than-ideal user experience.Based on HTC’s website, the phone retails for approximately $1000 in BTC, ETH, or LTC and will be released sometime this month.Impact on BraveAs of July, Brave had over 3.1 million active users, with that number steadily growing. Depending on the number of Exodus line phones that are sold in retail, the integration could substantially increase the number of customers who come use the Brave browser. Or, it could fall flat. According to one Taiwanese publication, HTC’s sales in February dipped to a 13-year low, while underperforming against growing Chinese phone brands.Consequently, more users on Brave mean more users who can use Basic Attention Token. That said, considering the early-state of the new phone, it’s hard to tell whether the integration will have a noticeable impact on BAT adoption in 2019.Posted In: Basic Attention Token, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

The platform began supporting Basic Attention Token (BAT), 0x (ZRX), and USDC (USD Coin) earlier this year.Coins Under ConsiderationIn the recent announcement, Coinbase stated it is exploring a broad range of assets, including thirty-plus popular cryptocurrencies.The list, in alphabetical order: Cardano (ADA), Aeternity (AE), Aragon (ANT), Bread Wallet (BRD), Civic (CVC), Dai (DAI), district0x (DNT), EnjinCoin (ENJ), EOS (EOS), Golem Network (GNT), IOST (IOST), Kin (KIN), Kyber Network (KNC), ChainLink (LINK), Loom Network (LOOM), Loopring (LRC), Decentraland (MANA), Mainframe (MFT), Maker (MKR), NEO (NEO), OmiseGo (OMG), Po.et (POE), QuarkChain (QKC), Augur (REP), Request Network (REQ), Status (SNT), Storj (STORJ), Stellar (XLM), XRP (XRP), Tezos (XTZ), and Zilliqa (ZIL). More information on these coins are available in the CryptoSlate coins database.Related: Coinbase Adds Zero-Fee Cryptocurrency Withdrawals and Sells Through PayPalCoinbase mentioned that “adding new assets requires significant exploratory work,” with the process involving substantial “technical and compliance” review. Also, it cannot guarantee that all of the cryptocurrencies above will be listed, nor does it guarantee that these assets will be available in all jurisdictions. Some of these coins may not be usable for sending or receiving with a Coinbase wallet, significantly hampering practical use.During the process, those watching the listing process may see Coinbase launch new public-facing APIs, or other signs that the company is conducting engineering work geared toward supporting these new assets. The company will continue to update its users via the Coinbase Blog and Twitter.Motives Behind New ListingsAccording to Coinbase, tokens are chosen based on the “relative ease of integrating the [token’s] standard” with the company’s existing infrastructure. Coinbase emphasizes “security” concerns. However, the inclusion of ERC20 tokens uses much of the same infrastructure. Why Coinbase has chosen to list the four ERC20s over other potential candidates is subject to speculation.In the announcement, Coinbase stated that they will accept deposits sometime today, and will enable trading within 48 hours after deposits are enabled.Only Coinbase Pro users will have access to trading in the following jurisdictions: U.S., U.K., European Union, Canada, Singapore, and Australia. The company mentions that it may add other jurisdictions at a later date.Launch ProcessPrior to full trading, Coinbase will gradually ramp-up trading options in hopes trading will begin smoothly. Each phase will be announced on Coinbase Pro’s Twitter.Transfer Only (12 hours): Starting sometime today, customers will have the option to transfer CVC, DNT, LOOM, and Mana into a Coinbase Pro account. Users will not be able to place orders, nor will orders get filled on order books.Post Only (1 minute): Customers can post limit orders, but there will be no matches to complete those orders. Order books will remain in post only mode for a maximum of one minute.Limit Only (10 minutes): Limit orders will start matching, but customers will not be able to submit market orders.Full Trading: Full trading will begin once the limit order phase is complete, including limit, market, and stop orders.Catching Up With ExchangesAlthough Coinbase has recently introduced a new listing process in an “effort to increase the number of tokens” listed on the platform—including its announcement considering its thirty-plus cryptos—the company has still fallen behind on the number of assets available, especially when compared to major exchanges.Coinbase Pro currently has only 12 different cryptocurrencies available for trading. According to CoinGecko, international exchange Binance offers 163 coins, and U.S. exchange Bittrex offers 253 different cryptos.Coinbase has gained considerable traction in the U.S. market and is pushing to expand into other jurisdictions. As one of the most valuable companies in the crypto space, it is possible that Coinbase can leverage its access to retail customers and gain a foothold in the U.S. market—allowing it to compete with major exchanges, such as Binance. How the competition will unfold is yet to be seen.Posted In: Coinbase, San Francisco, Adoption, Altcoins, Exchanges, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

366,CryptoSlate,Zcoin Implementing ASIC Resistant Merkle Tree Proof (MTP) Crypto Mining,Mitchell Moos,1544007300.0,"Zcoin is implementing a new mining algorithm that hampers FPGA, ASIC, and botnet mining. Merkle Tree proof of work (MTP) has the potential to move cryptocurrency mining away from huge farms and back into the hands of crypto enthusiasts, once again decentralizing mining.Merkle Tree proof of work mining is a solution implemented to remedy the issues faced by small-time miners. Most mining algorithms are susceptible to FPGAs and ASICs, mining hardware which is far more efficient than readily available computer hardware. Usually, this hardware is only available to huge corporations whose engineer can design better hardware. On Dec. 10th Zcoin will implement this new algorithm.Details on Merkle Tree ProofsMTP is protected because it is “memory” intensive. It is much more difficult to develop specialized mining hardware for a memory-intensive mining algorithm. By making cryptocurrency mining more egalitarian, it is further decentralized. Greater decentralization makes it harder for miners to collude and perform a 51 percent attack, or perform other nefarious activities which could harm the performance and security of a blockchain.Related: Analysis: Bitcoin Costs $1.4 Billion to 51% Attack, Consumes as Much Electricity as MoroccoAnother issue that MTP addresses are botnets. Currently, there are millions of devices that have malicious code. Hackers fill their wallets by using these hijacked devices to mine cryptocurrency.According to Zcoin’s website, users infected by computer viruses that participate in botnets experience noticeable performance degradation and are therefore more likely to suspect something is wrong with their computer.Once a user notices a dip in performance, a clever user could deduce that there might be malicious mining occurring, and would have an opportunity to eliminate the malicious code. This feature is unique to Zcoin and is not seen in other ASIC resistant algorithms.Primer on ZcoinZcoin is a privacy-coin that uses the unique ‘Zerocoin’ protocol. This protocol uses zero-knowledge proofs enabling scalable privacy to the many thousands of transactions, unlike Bitcoin mixers and ring signatures, which are limited to a few hundred transactions and have other privacy vulnerabilities, according to the Zcoin’s website.Centralization in Other AlgorithmsThere is a body of evidence to suggest that existing proof-of-work methods—such as Bitcoin’s SHA-256, Litecoin and Dogecoin’s Scrypt, and Dash’s X11 algorithms—are centralized to massive ASIC farms because normal miners would often have to mine at a loss if wanting to participate in these networks. Even for the often touted “ASIC-resistant” Ethereum Ethash algorithm, there is evidence that Bitmain, one of the world’s largest miners, has already developed an ASIC for it.Related Story: Vitalik Buterin: Ethash ASICs Not a Threat to EthereumFor Bitcoin, it is estimated that between 70 to 80 percent of mining occurs in China. If a handful of those miners colluded, there is a possibility that they could conduct a 51 percent attack on the Bitcoin network.That said, there are some cryptocurrencies which are actively combating mining centralization. Monero, and now Zcoin, are leading the charge for ASIC-thwarting updates.Comments from the TeamCryptoSlate reached out to Reuben Yap, the COO of Zcoin. According to Yap, the underlying reasoning for building-in ASIC resistance into Zcoin is to combat centralization:“For a currency to succeed it needs wide distribution, and ASICs don’t provide that distribution. An ASIC miner[‘s] main job is to make money.”To achieve that distribution early on in a coin’s mining, it is essential to have fair and even distribution of rewards:“Early on in a coin’s distribution and timeline you need to have that fair mining to distribute [the currency]. If we are dominated by ASICs now, then only a handful of people will own the new supply.”Unlike the manufacturers of general computer hardware, ASIC miners are also incentivized to hoard the hardware they design because it is as if they were selling a “money making machine”:“…A miner manufacturer selling ASICs has to decide whether to keep or sell. This is not the same as other industry [players] such as AMD or Intel, where there is no incentive to hoard their own products. Why should I sell a money making machine?”Interestingly, Yap isn’t anti-ASIC. He believes there are positives to having ASICs dominate a well-established cryptocurrency:“Also for the record I’m not anti-ASICs. ASICs do fill a role and maybe when a coin is mature, ASICs offer greater security as long as you’re the dominant coin of that hardware”He elaborates on why ASICs can be positive for the security of a network:“As an ASIC that can only do one thing, it doesn’t make sense to attack the coin that gives my ASIC value. When I am invested in an ASIC I am effectively investing in the coin family [that uses that same mining algorithm].”According to Yap, the Zcoin team had initially scheduled to introduce MTP mid last year:“MTP was meant to have been launched middle of last year. Lyra2z was always meant to be a temporary algorithm and we knew it wasn’t ASIC resistant but we only saw us using it for a couple of months”However, a few weeks before MTP launched, an academic paper was published that highlighted weaknesses in the MTP algorithm, so additional software development needed to be done before MTP was ready for implementation:“An academic paper was published [by] Dinur and Nadler that highlighted ways to reduce MTP[‘s] ASIC resistance, and so we had to fund additional research and bounties to [security] harden MTP.”Yap concluded by explaining how proof-of-stake and delegated proof-of-stake excel in performance and throughput, essential features for a smart contract platform. Meanwhile, proof-of-work excels at distributing coins fairly and tying real world cost to a chain; Essential components to a currency, like Zcoin.How to Start MiningAt the moment, MTP has software available for both CPU and Nvidia GPUs. Mining software for AMD GPUs is slated for release in the next two weeks.Related: TRON Ramping Up Privacy, Adopting zk-SNARKs from ZcashAccording to Zcoin, the most efficient way to mine on MTP is using GPUs with at least 4.5 GB of RAM. For those interested in mining using MTP, refer to Zcoin’s official mining guide.It is promising to see projects such as Zcoin contribute to the ASIC resistant movement. Since the software development for cryptocurrencies is often open-source, these improvements are transferable to other cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, diversity in cryptocurrency choice allows for greater diversity in the market, meaning more innovation and greater security. In all, Zcoin has made another stride in building a more private, more secure way to transact over the web.Dec. 6, 2018, 07:40: Article revised to reflect that the move to MPT will occur on December 10th.Posted In: Altcoins, Privacy, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

367,CryptoSlate,Ethereum Vs. TRON Battle Intensifies: Vitalik Buterin and Justin Sun Clash Over Twitter,Mitchell Moos,1543834740.0,"Justin Sun and Vitalik Buterin clash once again over Twitter. The two juggernauts are back to unleashing criticisms against each other’s platforms as Ethereum and TRON battle for market dominance.On Twitter today, Justin Sun once again touted the merits of the TRON platform. In a tweet, he linked an article where Vitalik Buterin stated:“…basically the next wave of crypto adoption is not going to be built on hype because the hype is basically already come. It has to come from really useful applications and things delivering value to people.”In response to Buterin’s comment, Justin Sun tweeted the following:“[Vitalik Buterin] admits that ETH lead the 2017 bull run built on hype. TRON will lead the next bull run built on massive adoption, dApps and BitTorrent… $TRX [TRON’s ticker symbol]”The comments are consistent with Justin Sun’s usual promotion of TRON, having previously elucidated multiple times that TRON would cause the next “bull run.”In response to Sun’s underhanded comment, Buterin fired back by saying that anyone who uses their own ticker symbol in a tweet is “basically a self-identified shill and not worth listening to.”Sun sarcastically responded by saying that Buterin can criticize his use of the TRX ticker after the Ethereum platform matches TRON’s alleged “2 million transactions per second” throughput:We can talk about the dollar sign after the day #ETH reaches 2 million Txs per day, which I think will never happen. 😊#TRON https://t.co/MnnSFBPtZx— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) December 3, 2018History of RivalryThe tense relationship between Vitalik Buterin and Justin Sun stretches back to the origins of TRON. In the past, Buterin has extensively criticized Sun’s blatant plagiarism in TRON’s whitepaper, taking excerpts directly from IPFS and FileCoin, and then using code without attribution.Related: The Wrath of Vitalik: Crypto Savant Hulks Out, Rampages on TwitterIn an underhanded comment from Buterin (referencing the plagiarism), he remarked that Justin Sun could have more easily stolen from these projects by using the hotkeys “Ctrl + C/Ctrl + V” to improve his plagiarism efficiency.Buterin even went so far as to call out Justin Sun’s plagiarism in a meta April Fool’s joke. In a light-hearted Ethereum Improvement Proposal (the process which the Ethereum developer community decides on how to make software updates) Vitalik Buterin plagiarized 20 percent of the proposal from the TRON website, paying tribute to the white paper and code copying incidents.However, Justin Sun is far from defenseless. He did not let the criticisms slide, and increased his own attacks on Ethereum, saying that in a bear market developers should migrate to TRON:In bear market, #Ethereum developers should migrate your token to #TRON immediately. 1. 0 transaction fee, no gas in #TRX. 2. Compatible to #ETH, 0 migration cost. 3. 2000 TPS. 4. #TRON dex listing. You can easily increase your token value 100% with High liquidity. $TRX— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) November 26, 2018Perhaps Buterin is right to say that Sun is outright shilling TRON for his own gain, implying that those who extol “1000x” gains encourage “people to act more like Justin Sun.”“If you spin things this way [saying that the market will experience 1000x price increases] you’re *incentivizing* people to act more like Justin Sun.”Or, alternatively, maybe Justin Sun is justified in his promotion of TRON. Assuming his claims are accurate, TRON might be that much better than Ethereum. Perhaps Justin Sun’s TRON will bid “goodbye” to Ethereum as TRX surpasses ETH.Whatever the result, Justin Sun’s aggressive marketing of the TRON project does not sit well with Vitalik Buterin’s more reserved technology-first style of leadership. Given those circumstances, it seems unlikely that the two will ever reconcile their disagreements around the two competing platforms.Posted In: Ethereum, Tron, Altcoins, People     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

368,CryptoSlate,"NEO Announces ‘NeoFS’ Distributed File Storage, Competing with Dropbox and Amazon S3",Mitchell Moos,1543635600.0,"On Nov. 30th, NEO announced—in collaboration with NSPCC—that they are developing a distributed file storage system that would work as a “cornerstone” of the NEO platform. NeoFS would “allow users to take back control of their data,” and would be as “simple to use as Dropbox” or “Amazon S3.”NEO is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency that is designed to build a scalable network of decentralized applications using widely used programming languages. The Chinese-based platform is described as a major competitor to Ethereum.In an article from NEO News Today , at the Nov. 30th NEO meetup held in St. Petersburg, the NEO St. Petersburg Competence Center (NSPCC) officially revealed the details of NEO’s upcoming distributed file storage feature.Details on NeoFSDistributed storage is a critical element of online software and web services, and is vital to attracting enterprise-level and open-source developers to build on the NEO platform. The under-development system would allow users to leverage distributed storage for both private and public dApps built on NEO.The move is targeting those concerned with their privacy. As stated in a promotional video for NeoFS:“Often enough the server [that stores your data] is owned by a big company, and that company becomes an owner of your files…. They can take a peek at what you share to sell you something or to tell you something. So, why not take back control with NeoFS.”Moreover, the system is slated to compete directly with two of the juggernauts in cloud storage, Amazon and Dropbox, describing the system as “…easy to use as Dropbox, or if you’re a developer, Amazon S3.”When launched, storage will be available for purchase using GAS (CGAS NEP-5), a resource generated from NEO tokens over time. Meanwhile, consumers of data would not need to pay to access data stored on NeoFS. In the future, there is mention of other possible payment options, including fiat.In an infographic from NEO, the company claims that the integrity of data is assured by “homomorphic hashing,” a type of encryption that allows for secure outsourced computation. The system would be maintained by two levels of nodes and will allow for objects to be located and retrieved P2P without calling central nodes, essentially serving as a more structured version of a torrent swarm.Background on NSPCCNSPCC is a research and development company formed to support the NEO core ecosystem. The company is largely driven by the City of Zion, an independent group of open-source developers who work to support NEO core.Some of the heavy-hitters behind the NSPCC include Neon exchange co-founder Fabian Wahle, along with a host of engineers from the Russian Association of Cryptoindustry and Blockchain (RACIB).Engineers Behind the SystemNSPCC is the first candidate for developing NeoFS. According to NEO, distributed file storage is a “cornerstone” to its blockchain. NSPCC has the full support of NEO Global Development (NGD), an organization founded by the NEO Foundation for the execution and development of the NEO platform.Using these resources the NSPCC has assembled a high-caliber team of ten members who have “strong academic and industry backgrounds, comprising multiple PhDs and experts in data infrastructure,” with talent “attracted… from companies such as Dell, Samsung, WhatsApp, and Yandex.”In a quote from NGD, general manager Johnson Zhao stated:“We are very excited about the promising developments by NSPCC and look forward to expand our relationship with the Russian ecosystem.”Timeline and RamificationsWork on the platform began in Q4 of 2018. The core of the platform will be developed in Q1 of 2019, and major features will be developed in Q2 of 2019.The beta for NeoFS is scheduled to launch Q3 of 2019.The implementation of a distributed data storage solution would be a huge stride for the NEO platform. Other cryptocurrency projects, such as FileCoin and Storj—which raised $257 and $30 million through ICOs—have been ineffective at taking market share from major cloud storage providers. So far, both blockchain services have been unable to compete with the price and convenience of centralized file storage.That said, perhaps the expertise and execution of the NEO team could give Amazon and Dropbox something to worry about.Posted In: Neo, Altcoins, Privacy, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

369,CryptoSlate,"TRON Ramping Up Privacy, Adopting zk-SNARKs from Zcash",Mitchell Moos,1543662300.0,"In an interview, Justin Sun, the Founder and CEO of TRON, discusses how the platform will implement Zcash’s zk-SNARKs cryptography in Q1 of 2019. Such a move would bring users greater anonymity and privacy.On Nov. 28th episode of The Bad Crypto Podcast, co-host Rachel Wolfson interviews Justin Sun on the progress of TRON’s technology and its adoption.Justin Sun spoke about a host of different developments within the TRON ecosystem: delegated proof-of-stake governance, integrations with BitTorrent, the blockchain’s impact on the industry, and most notably, its planned implementation of zk-SNARKs.Argument for PrivacyAccording to Justin Sun, social media websites and search engines are monetizing user data, and many users on these platforms feel that this is an invasion of privacy:“[People] don’t want their privacy stored by Facebook or Google because those people can more easily manipulate the data so they can push ads to you. You don’t want to share those data with them. That’s why I think the decentralized way becomes a good way to do that [and limit how much data you are required to share].”Introducing zk-SNARKsBy leveraging existing technologies, Justin Sun can push the TRON protocol substantially increasing privacy through the use of zk-SNARKs:“Q1 [2019] we will implement zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge-proofs) into our network. This is how we can improve privacy in the whole network. In the future, if you want these privacy transactions and a private address, we can make sure… they cannot see you and the transaction can be untraceable.”zk-SNARKs is a novel form of zero-knowledge cryptography. First widely popularized by privacy coin Zcash, zero-knowledge proofs are now used in a host of different cryptocurrency projects.The adoption of this feature would have some interesting ramifications. Once implemented, users would be able to ‘shield’ transactions—effectively encrypting those transactions. If implemented correctly, such encryption would allow TRX users to hide the amount, the sender, and the recipient of a transaction.Privacy Shortcomings of BitcoinRelated: Bitcoin Addresses Linked to Two Criminals by U.S. Department of Treasury: Exchanges Face Potential “Secondary Sanctions”This level of privacy is more critical than ever. Currently, on the Bitcoin network, it is possible for people to deduce wallet ownership by analyzing the transaction history of the Bitcoin ledger.Just recently, the U.S. Department of Treasury likely used these methods to determine the identities of two Iranian money-launderers who used Bitcoin in a cyber-ransom scheme.If zk-SNARKs was implemented—and limiting the risk of compromised user privacy—TRON could allow users the choice of shielding their transactions from public view, as said by Justin Sun:“We provide a different solution and, depending on your preference, you can choose the different one [on using zk-SNARKs or not].”Other ConsiderationsHowever, according to the Zcash development documents, for zk-SNARKs to be fully effective, it requires that a large percentage of users actively choose to shield their transactions. Otherwise, people in the system could potentially deduce address ownership using the remaining history on a ledger.To implement the new cryptography scheme, it appears that the TRON Foundation has forked the Zcash code base, and it is possible that the Foundation intends to implement the zk-SNARKs portion of that code base.Whether or not users will leverage shielded TRON transactions—or if it will have an impact on TRX’s price—is still open to speculation.Posted In: Tron, Zcash, Altcoins, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

370,CryptoSlate,"Steemit Lays Off 70% of Workforce, Hard Times Ahead",Priyeshu Garg,1543574340.0,"Blockchain-based social media platform Steemit is facing a crisis. CEO Ned Scott revealed on Nov. 27, 2018, that the company has been forced to lay off 70 percent of its workforce amid an atmosphere of falling crypto prices and high operational costs.In a post published on the company’s website, Scott revealed that the company is currently undergoing a fundamental reorganization, with a key focus on reducing costs and making the platform more economically sustainable.Background on Steemit’s TroublesSteemit prides itself as the first open source, decentralized, social media platform running on the Steem blockchain, a platform founded by Ned Scott, and Dan Larimer, creator of BitShares and EOS. Using the STEEM token, it rewards content publishers, curators, and consumers using a first-of-its-kind framework that promised at launch to disrupt the world of online content publishing by giving users control of their data and the monetization of that data.Parent company Steemit Inc. uses Steemit’s personnel and resources to develop and implement updates and upgrades to the Steam blockchain and equips third-party developers with Access Point Interfaces (API) as part of a holistic strategy to grow its developer ecosystem.At launch in 2016, it initially generated a considerable amount of buzz—even becoming one of the six largest cryptocurrencies by market cap of $157 million. As the hype subsided, however, Steemit largely stalled with user numbers, never quite achieving the expected critical mass, coinciding with problems surrounding adoption and integration.According to CoinMarketCap, the platform’s current market cap stands at about $106 million, substantially down from its peak. In addition to its own problems brought on by technology and user issues, it also suffered as a result of the overall crypto market downturn, which saw most major cryptocurrencies follow the losses of bitcoin. The result has been a general decline of about 70 percent across the board.Because of this, Steemit is now in need of significant structural reorganization and cost rationalization to preserve the platform.Steemit Corporate ReorganisationIn Tuesday’s statement, CEO Ned Scott blamed the ongoing market rout and high operating costs for the decision, revealing that the company has been forced to alter its short-term focus in the aftermath of the move. He asserted:“[With] the fiat returns on our automated selling of STEEM diminishing, as well as and the growing costs of running full Steem nodes, we have been forced to lay off close to 70% of the team. The remainder of the team is staying on to focus primarily on reducing the costs of the infrastructure responsible for running steemit.com. . .”According to Steemit’s founder, the company has already conducted a company-wide meeting in the aftermath of the mass layoffs, reaching an agreement that its key short-term focus should be on performing technical changes to Steem. By replacing Steem’s old plugins with Hivemind, the project could reduce the size of its blockchain from a massive 160GB to 0GB on the user’s end. Such changes could greatly streamline the user experience and reduce overhead costs such as cloud hosting.These drastic moves by Steem show that the company is still dedicated to building a decentralized, user-driven, social media platform. However, to survive the market trough the company will need to make deep cuts and lay off a majority of its workforce. How this will impact the company’s long-term prospects is uncertain.Posted In: Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Despite being just a few months old, the platform managed to attract a strong user base, beating the much older more well-known Ethereum platform in almost every category.According to data from DappRadar, the top ranking dApp on the TRON Network, TRONbet, currently has more users than the top ranking Ethereum app, IDEX. Despite IDEX being an exchange, the gambling app TRONbet also managed to surpass it in terms of the number of transactions taking place over a period of 24 hours.The total value of transactions made across 24 hours is also significantly larger on TRONbet, with the app reporting 200 million TRX, or around $3.5 million at current prices. In comparison, the IDEX exchange reported a trading volume of 2,600 ETH, which when converted amounts to just over $300,00.TRON Leads in Gambling AppsRelated: What is Project Atlas?

TRX currently holds the 12th position in the website’s top 100 listing and saw a surge of over 31 percent on Nov. 28.The coin’s gains are mostly attributed to the company’s latest announcement, as users are now able to use TRX to buy one-year subscriptions on BitTorrent or µTorrent products, including Ads Free and Pro Windows.Posted In: Tron, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

374,CryptoSlate,"Bitcoin Obliterates $4000 Support Level; Market Loses Another $18 Billion, Altcoins Reeling",Mitchell Moos,1543041660.0,"Within the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has once again made a dive through a historic price support after dropping 14 percent, puncturing its $4000 support-level and settling at a yearly low of $3800.In the last ten days, BTC has taken a beating, bringing down most of the market. Having experienced its third major drop in the last 10 days, Bitcoin holders have now experienced losses of over $2600 per coin; a 24-hour loss of 12 percent, and a 10-day cumulative loss of 40 percent. Moreover, the overall market downturn reflects Bitcoin’s price.State of AltcoinsOther popular altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC), are at their all-time lows of 2018 at $111 and $29, respectively.Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS (EOS), Stellar (XLM), and other altcoins are down 10-15 percent across the board. This time around, Ripple’s XRP coin has followed the market trend. The crypto has so far lost 12 percent, rather than holding steady, as seen in other market drops. Factom has again defied the market with gains of 5 percent.The biggest losers this dip include MonaCoin, Mithril, and WaltonChain, with losses between 20 and 30 percent. Of the top 20, Stellar and Zcash have experienced the largest drops with losses of 17 and 16 percent.What Caused the DropAnalysts have attributed the drop to several different factors. The drop may have been fueled by the discovery of price manipulation by stable coin issuer Tether. Researchers found that the company may have been printing USD Tether (USDT), a cryptocurrency allegedly backed by 1 USD per coin, without any backing at all.These actions were reportedly done in conjunction with the major crypto exchange Bitfinex in an attempt to drive up market prices. The incident came to a head when the U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation.Related: SEC Cryptocurrency Crackdown: Two More ICOs PenalizedAnother possible explanation for the downturn is the SEC’s increasing scrutiny of the market. The Commission issued its first judgments on two ICOs, cracking down on Paragon Coin and AirToken.These judgments were issued shortly after the founder of the decentralized exchange EtherDelta, Zachary Coburn, was penalized for illegally operating a securities exchange.These actions may indicate that the SEC is willing to drop the hammer on projects in the future, spooking the market and investors.One final reason could be the factional dispute within Bitcoin Cash. BCH figureheads Roger Ver and Craig Wright have openly brawled over the future of the cryptocurrency, without resolution. Lack of consensus between the two factions caused the coin to fork, splitting the Bitcoin Cash community. The incident could serve as a harbinger for Bitcoin’s fate at the hands of its own mining cartels, further undermining investor confidence.Or, perhaps, it might be none of the above. The market could be correcting itself after seeing celestial highs in early 2018, returning to levels consistent with the nascent state of the technology. Whatever the reason, it seems that market matadors are prepared to deliver a coup de grâce to market bulls.

376,CryptoSlate,Market Analysis: How Altcoins are Impacted by Bitcoin’s Price Drop,Mitchell Moos,1542758400.0,"On Nov. 20, Bitcoin (BTC) shredded past its $5000 resistance-level to the $4000 price range, dragging most of the market downwards. Correspondingly, the altcoin market is devastated with Bitcoin and XRP absorbing lost market share.Bitcoin and Overall Market CapitalizationThe market hits new lows with Bitcoin falling towards $4000; going as low as $4050 on Coinbase. The decrease follows the precipitous drop on Nov. 14, marking a 13-month low for BitcoinOverall, the market has lost 31 percent of its value in the last seven days, a total loss of $64 billion in capitalization. In the last day, the market dropped from $162 billion to $140 billion, a loss of 11 percent.Top Gains and LossesRelated: Explained: Bitcoin Cash Hash Wars, Where the Factions Stand on the IssuesMost cryptocurrencies are down across the board, with Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and Aelf (ELF) leading the pack with losses between 20-35 percent. Major losses in Bitcoin Cash stem from the recent hard fork, as well as the following hash war between Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV.Factom (FCT) stands out as a cryptocurrency that has been able to weather the drop with surprising resiliency, boasting 10 percent gains, in spite of the market downturn. This break out performance is related to the coin’s recent partnership with Equator, a residential loan software provider.To prevent further losses, converting cryptocurrency holdings into a stable coin such as Dai (DAI), Maker (MKR), USDCoin (USDC), or TrueUSD (TUSD), could hedge against further drops. Tether (USDT) should be avoided because of the recent U.S. Justice Department’s investigation.Ripple (XRP) was an outlier during the drop on Nov. 14th, overtaking Ethereum (ETH) as the number two cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, this time around the two currencies are experiencing similar losses. Ripple is down 12 percent and Ethereum is down 15 percent, respectively.Changes in Market ShareIn terms of market share, the biggest gainers this week were Bitcoin and Ripple. Bitcoin’s percentage of total market share inched upwards in absolute terms from 52.5 percent to 53.1 percent, a 1.1 percent relative gain. Ripple gobbled-up market share, going from 9.8 percent to 12.2 percent dominance, a 24 percent increase.The biggest losers this week are Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. Ethereum’s market share has deteriorated from 10.2 percent to 9.5 percent, a 6.9 percent loss.Market Share: Small-Cap Altcoins (Gray); Ripple (Light Blue); Ethereum (Dark Blue); Bitcoin Cash (Green) Graph courtesy of CoinMarketCap.comBitcoin Cash plummeted from 4.3 to 2.8 percent market share, a whopping relative loss of 35 percent. However, these figures are likely muddled by differing prices for each fork (BCH and BSV), and how different exchanges are treating each of these forks.On Poloniex, Bitcoin Cash ABC is trading at $210, and Bitcoin Cash S.V. is trading at $40, slightly above the $220 aggregate price quoted by most exchanges.Overall, the altcoin market (excluding the coins mentioned above) is down from 18.8 to 18.3 percent market share, a 2.7 percent loss.It’s unknown how far Bitcoin could fall before rebounding. If Bitcoin continues to fall, it is likely that the altcoin market will suffer greater losses, barring outliers such as Ripple and Factom.

The blockchain served as an immutable database and was used in order to provide auditability to the Thai Election Commission and Democrat Party candidates.According to Computer Weekly, encryption keys were split using a cryptographic method called Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme, and voter identification documents could only be decrypted by a member of the Thai electoral commission or a representative of the Democrat Party for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of voters.Zcoin Explores the Future of VotingZcoin is an open source, decentralized privacy coin that pioneered the use of the Zerocoin protocol which uses zero-knowledge proofs in its privacy scheme to break transactions links. Zcoin, which has been live since September 2016, is currently traded on exchanges such as Binance, Bittrex, and Huobi.Speaking of the event, Poramin Insom, founder and lead developer of Zcoin, said that both the company has achieved a huge milestone in the country’s political history and that he hopes that more elections, both in Thailand and abroad, would look into blockchain technology.The way this primary election was run will have significant implications for Thailand’s first national election, since the military coup in 2014, set to take place next year.

The first batch of recipients will be getting their XLM this week, according to TechCrunch. In an effort to increase mainstream adoption, they say, Stellar is giving its XLR away for free to people that sign up for it via their website, which states: “The first step to becoming an active participant in the crypto ecosystem is getting a crypto asset.

Users will also be required to verify their identity to prevent multiple disbursements to the same person. Once their identity is verified, each user will get $25 worth of XLM crypto. Stellar’s network takes aim at the marketplace of global financial transactions, seeking to make them easier and more seamless. XLM currently sits at $.26USD, with a market cap of almost $5BN. This airdrop marks the XLM’s addition to Blockchain as the wallet’s fourth supported cryptocurrency alongside Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum.Regarding the decision to airdrop so much of his company’s crypto, Stellar co-founder Jed McCaleb said:“Our hope is to eventually have global citizens own and use lumens, in both developing and developed economies. By working with Blockchain to increase the availability and active use of lumens on the network, leveraging their almost 30m wallets, we will increase the network’s utility by many orders of magnitude.”More News on Partnerships to ComeBlockchain stated that it also has plans to partner with several charitable organizations as part of this airdrop, including Stanford’s d.school, Charity: water, Code.org, and Network for Good. The wallet maker said it chose these companies to partner with because they “share our vision for using this transformational technology,” and will be donating to Charity: water. Blockchain said more details on these partnerships would be revealed in the coming weeks, and Stanford d.school’s Director of Teaching and Learning Carissa Carter stated: “The strength of any network is derived from innovation.

379,CryptoSlate,"BAT Listed on Coinbase Pro, Price Jumps 32 Percent Within Minutes of Announcement",Shaurya Malwa,1541390400.0,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase listed the Basic Attention Token (BAT) on its “Pro” trading platform on Nov. 2, after months of speculation surrounding the support of popular altcoins.BAT’s Market DominanceRelated: BAT-Enabled Brave Browser Hits 10 Million DownloadsA utility token powering the Brave browser and marketplace, BAT is the world’s 30th largest cryptocurrency by the total market cap of $295 million. It was launched in June 2017 and raised $35 million in a mere 30 seconds during ICO, making it amongst the fastest-selling token issuances of all time.Coinbase’s decision comes after months of retail speculation regarding the listing of altcoins on the exchange. While the bourse counts 10 million users on its platforms, its business practices are typically conservative and tend to follow strict regulatory guidelines. Recently, the company was valued at a mammoth $8 billion and is dubbed by mainstream media quarters as the “Google of Cryptocurrencies.”Currently, customers are able to deposit BAT on Pro’s trading platform for an undefined period – until “sufficient liquidity” is amassed for the digital asset.  Once the latter is achieved, the BAT/USD trading pair will be the first to open trading.Coinbase.com Announcement May FollowSimilar to previous altcoin listings, Coinbase shall introduce a four-step process for the responsible trading and onboarding of new clients, investors, and traders – transfer-only, post-only, limit-only, and full trading.Although BAT is a decentralized, borderless cryptocurrency, citizens from New York will not be able to purchase BAT due to a strict regulatory climate surrounding financial startups in the region.For now, it is not available for purchase on Coinbase.com, the firm’s proprietary business. Instead, it makes an appearance on Pro’s iOS and Android application, with the firm adding a separate announcement will be made at later stages for significant developments.At the time of writing, BAT trading is up 32 percent at 33 cents from a low of 26 cents on Nov. 1. The price jump is explained by the colloquially-dubbed “Coinbase Effect,” meaning immense price spikes of a particular asset after Coinbase makes a listing announcement.

380,CryptoSlate,Zcoin Gives ASICs the Boot with Merkle Tree Proofs,Jonnie Emsley,1540551600.0,"In a direct challenge to the type of industrial-grade efforts that have transformed once-lone cryptocurrency miners into multi-billion-dollar oligarchies, Zcoin has held itself up as the first cryptocurrency to “democratize” mining using Merkle Tree Proofs, a PoW algorithm for ASIC-resistance.According to the team behind the zero-knowledge proof privacy coin, Zcoin’s newfangled feature sticks it to centralized mining farms and purportedly “levels the playing field” for miners of their Zerocoin protocol-based cryptocurrency, a press release stated.Sticking it to the Main?Arguably the poster child of massive mining outfits, Beijing-based Bitmain has for years captured a vast portion of BTC block rewards using its proprietary ASIC mining equipment — at times becoming a punching bag of sorts for Bitcoin maximalists when the giant’s hashpower flirts with the much-dreaded 51 percent-attack threshold.While he didn’t reveal names, Zcoin COO Reuben Yap seemed to suggest that the advantages proffered to affluent mining outfits were fast making mining a zero-sum game. He noted:Miner centralization is a growing issue amongst blockchain communities, as those with the resources to dedicate research and development towards the development of ASICs are able to gain a significant advantage over the network and reap the rewards.Related: Leaked Data Allegedly Reveals $1.2 Billion Bitmain Q1 Profits, Bitcoin Hashing Power at All Time HighAnd judging by Bitmain’s balance sheet, the spoils of ASIC-enabled victory would be plentiful — as reported previously by CryptoSlate, data leaked in August alleged that in Q1 this year the mining titan had taken more than $1.2 billion in profits as its collection of mining pools as Bitcoin hashing power reached its all-time high.Merkle Tree Proofs: Coming to a Blockchain Near You?Where ASIC rigs have taken democracy out of the equation for miners, then, one of its creators would claim Merkle Tree Proofs (MTPs) as the answer to creating an “egalitarian” PoW network.Using ample amounts of one-way hashing, MTPs purportedly vets all miners to prove they are not exceeding the computational power of conventional hardware, such as CPUs, thus offering giving no leg up to the bountiful horsepower seen in ever-improving ASICs.Crucially, one of the protocol’s authors, Professor Dmitry Kovratovich, seemed to suggest that MTP could take ASICs out of business on any blockchain:“The primary idea with MTP is to build a PoW algorithm on a very fast and memory hard hash function, Argon2. Now, any distributed protocol can include MTP in its rounds to ensure that different parties use different machines, ideally desktops.”Such a proposition would surely come as music to the ears of decentralization proponents, as regional bans on ASIC equipment — such as in Vietnam — have thrown a further spanner in the works of Bitcoin’s existentially open, inclusive, and geographically irrespective node base.Posted In: Altcoins, Mining, Privacy, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Sood told VentureBeat that Unikrn had passed “a major audit” by the IOM regulators to ensure its know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and digital wallet practices were up to scratch.Unikrn’s betting platform will also feature technology from Bittrex, a U.S.-based blockchain platform providing real-time trading and industry-leading security.

Previously, the firm had revealed its “intentions” to “explore” crypto-assets for potential trading on their platform, including 0x (ZRX), Cardano (ADA), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Stellar Lumens (XLM) and Zcash (ZEC).Related: 0x (ZRX) Price Up 15% After Launching on Coinbase ProIn the blog post, Coinbase stated one of the most common requests from its customers was to offer more cryptocurrencies for trading on its platform. Now, the firm has declared its intentions for adding support well in advance to presumably avoid a Bitcoin Cash-like debacle – which spurred insider trading rumors after the asset’s prices hit $8,500 on Coinbase and traded at $3,500 on other exchanges.For now, users from New York and the United Kingdom will not have access to trading ZRX due to unresolved regulatory issues The addition of ZRX is a move away from well-established cryptocurrencies that Coinbase is known for listing. The exchange typically adds utility tokens and keeps a distance from security tokens, which ZRX may be classified under by some critics.Conflict of Interest AccusationsMeanwhile, the Twitterverse called out a conflict of interest in the ZRX listing.

With the team expanding, Storm’s decentralized freelancer marketplace is making upgrades to the user interface and aggressively adding new features.CEO Simon Yu Offers Q3 UpdateStormX is in the process of hiring new senior executives and making key partnerships to offer users more ways to earn cryptocurrency, according to a Medium post.In the past quarter, StormX’s mobile microtask application, Storm Play, has added over 346 new task offers and garnered 2.3 million total downloads on both iOS and Android. Storm Play offers tasks from companies, such as Airbnb, Uber, Instacart, and NexonM.The company also announced the promotion of Tara Nygaard to Chief Operations Officer along with the onboarding of Mark Keeney, VP of Marketing; Anurag Patnaik, Head of Marketplace; and Ian Brillembourg, Head of Mobile.Rewarding users in cryptocurrency, Storm Play has delivered over 228 BTC, 556 ETH, and over 243 million STORM tokens to-date. With its upcoming update, Storm Play will introduce a “More Offers” tab that connects users to a new set of third-party microtasks aside from the product, service and video tasks already offered on the platform.In the blog post, StormX CEO Simon Yu writes:“In an effort to give our users even more ways to earn, we signed a new partner last month to fuel our ’More Offers’ tab — which gives us access to hundreds of more offers to complement our own direct deals.”Hybrid Decentralized Application StructureIn order to maintain support for its 2.3 million users across over 180 countries worldwide, the Storm Play application utilizes both on and off chain methods. An off-chain ledger for Bolts, the in-app currency unit, and weekly payout schedule allows Storm Play to deliver low-cost cryptocurrency rewards at high volumes monthly.“Through a hybrid solution of both on chain and off chain methods we are able to process over a million transactions a month without any issues.”While blockchain offers key benefits, StormX believes that the current issues with scalability continue to hinder its full potential. While still exploring more ways to integrate with distributed ledger technology (DLT), Yu stated that its application structure is fitting of the current industry landscape.“As Ethereum only processes 15–20 transactions per second, we would congest the Ethereum network and cause it to crash faster than Crypto Kitties did. We recognized this early on and our tenure of being in the blockchain space for over four years is helping us succeed in balancing out the gaps between the blockchain technology and where we’re headed.”Comparing Storm’s old app design to its newest iteration.In the blog post, Storm reminds users of its STORM Loyalty Program and announces that a new Storm Play update will soon be released on both iOS and Android.

The development is third-of-its-kind, with similar hubs already present in Brisbane and New Zealand.NEM Australia head Jian Chan pointed out Melbourne has emerged as “one of the strongest blockchain communities” in Australia, and the city is home to numerous blockchain-focussed businesses and crypto-startups.Related: Introduction to NEM (XEM): The Proof-of-Importance CoinTo fulfill its objectives, the foundation has connected with lawyers and other professionals, startups, and other related organizations working in the DLT and cryptocurrency space. All parties will share information and expertise amongst themselves and engage in a more comprehensive “high-quality” discussion with small- and medium-sized businesses, corporations, and even listed firms showing interest in integrating the technology to their present infrastructure.Chan noted the “flexibility” of blockchains leads to its easy application in various sectors. However, he expressed concerns about “convoluted information” perpetrating through the industry that can develop into misleading knowledge about a particular product or blockchain application.Chan is optimistic about the NEM hub resonating among businesses in the Australian economy and notes that the country’s “top students” are studying the innovation, which in turn, indicates a healthy future for the technology as “that’s where the talent is.”Crypto Scepticism Good for IndustryChan believes startups and SMEs cannot miss out the economic opportunity to restore their businesses, by presumably providing accountability and transparency to customers.Meanwhile, Chan remains optimistic about cryptocurrencies in the long-term, despite 2018’s notorious bear market that has led to many questioning if the “bubble has burst.”Chan states:“The world of crypto moves at a velocity that is not normal — things move very fast and radically.”He adds that the most successful entrepreneurs are those who are most adaptable to change – regardless of the market cycle they are in. Furthermore, Chan believes skepticism “is very healthy,” and even legitimizes what the broader blockchain industry is trying to achieve as a whole.Posted In: Australia, Singapore, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Farmer said that Coinbase will monitor these books and if they do not meet Coinbase’s trading requirements, they could be kept in a certain stage for longer. Coinbase will live-tweet each phase as it moves through. Currently, all three order books are in phase one: the transfer-only phase. They’ll remain there for at least the next 12 hours, and Coinbase Pro customers won’t be able to place orders. Then, the books will be moved through the other phases. Phase two will be the “post-only” phase, allowing users to post orders without those orders being filled yet. Farmer says books will be kept in this state for a minimum of one minute, though that could be extended for a longer period. Next will be limit only, here limit orders will start being matched and require Coinbase customers to submit market orders. This phase will last at least ten minutes. After that, all books will be moved to the final phase where full trading will become available. This four-stage process is part of Coinbase’s new method of listing assets, as announced last month.

388,CryptoSlate,Adobe Flash Being Used For Cryptojacking,John Bogna,1539247920.0,"Cybersecurity software company Palo Alto Networks reports that miners looking to use your computer to expand their hashing power are getting sneakier. New fake Adobe updates are circulating that will actually update the plugin on your computer, but also install illicit mining malware. Hiding Behind Legitimate SofwareThese fakes are especially insidious because they do install the correct program along with the malware, fooling the user into believing that the update is legitimate.As in other instances of illicit mining, the hackers are going after Monero, who’s mandatory privacy protocol makes it extremely hard to trace. The fake installer updates Adobe Flash on the victim’s computer while installing XMRig in the background. The hidden program then uses the host computer’s processing power and graphics card to mine Monero without them knowing. Over one hundred of these fake update programs have been found by Palo Alto since March, according to TechCrunch. As the XMRig software page lists an idle operating system is ideal for maximum efficiency, its likely that this malware activates when a host computer isn’t being used.Graph by Palo Alto Networks showing the spike in fake Flash updaters in 2018.Flash has long been a favorite method for installing malware on the systems of unsuspecting users, which, along with updates to the web like HTML5 meaning Flash use is on the decline, probably contributed to Adobe’s decision to kill it in 2020. The Problem of Illicit Mining Malware ContinuesIllicit mining has grown exponentially this year, as stated in a report released by the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) last month. Hackers are using fake installers like the one discovered by Palo Alto Networks, but also exploiting vulnerabilities like Eternal Blue which allow them easy access to older systems. Once in, they install similar hidden malware that hijacks a computer into their mining network.CTA Chief Analytical Officer Neil Jenkins stated that cryptojacking is the “canary in the coal mine” of attacks because bad actors could exploit the same vulnerabilities used in cryptojacking for even more nefarious purposes. The executive summary report includes:“Illicit cryptocurrency mining is the figurative canary in the coal mine, warning you of much larger problems ahead. CTA members recount case after case of being called into an incident response for a mining infection and finding signs of multiple threat actors in the network.”Users may be wise to stick to newer protocols that don’t require the use of Flash, scan their systems regularly for malware with a reliable program, and be wary of any update notifications they might not recognize. Palo Alto Networks provides an appendix of fake updater examples and tips on how to spot them in their blog post.Unit 42 investigates a recent Fake Flash update pushing cryptocurrency mining software.

389,CryptoSlate,"SpankChain Smart Contract Compromised, Hackers Take $38,000 in Ethereum (ETH)",Shaurya Malwa,1539230400.0,"Blockchain-based adult entertainment protocol SpankChain revealed the theft of 165.8 ether (ETH), worth $38,000 at the time. The move occurred after hackers exploited a smart contract bug on the protocol, according to an official release on Oct.9.SPANK is “Spanked”As stated, the hack took place on Oct.6 when the SpankChain team was investigating multiple bugs on the $22.4 million-valued protocol. Of the total haul, 34.99 ETH and 1271.88 BOOTY tokens – which are generated when SPANK tokens are staked–belonged to users, and SpankChain owned the remainder.The team swiftly took their Spank.Live streaming service offline on locating the theft, and have since closed their camsite to prevent the transactions of stolen funds into the payment channel’s smart contract. Interestingly, the team found out about the hack on Oct.7, a day later than the actual theft.For the uninitiated, SpankChain’s is a multi-token protocol which utilizes SPANK tokens for staking purposes and creating smart contracts. Upon staking, users receive BOOTY tokens in proportion to their staked amount for use in purchasing the site’s services and tipping models. The latter are redeemable for SPANK tokens in the so-called SpankBank, and nefarious access to BOOTY tokens means free money for hackers if they encashed swiftly.The team announced a refund of stolen funds to its users and are preparing an ETH and BOOTY airdrop worth $9,300–the amount stolen from user funds – to cover losses and create a strong brand image. Airdropped tokens will be deposited to a user’s SpankBank account and made available when Spank.Live is rebooted, with the team guaranteeing the tokens credited once all systems are running again.SpankChain explained that the delay in launching the camsite is due to security and development reasons. The team is aiming to patch all bugs in the network, update Spank.Live with a new smart contract to prevent a repeat, and fix bugs discovered during the BOOTY upgrade.As part of the smart contract’s inbuilt security, 4,000 BOOTY tokens were “immobilized” when the theft took place. However, while the site will function as normal, the locked tokens mean SpankChain will reduce the BOOTY limit for each viewer to ten per user–allowing tips of no more than the amount. Users depositing extra ETH without knowledge of this point need not despair as well, as additional funds shall be immediately recharged in tranches of 10 BOOTYs.Attack ExplainedExplaining the attack, the team believe hackers infiltrated a known “reentrancy” bug–the same fallacy explained the infamous DAO hack. Attackers created a smart contract disguised as an ERC20 token, where the “transfer” function allowed “paid” funds to be sent into the payment channel contract multiple times.The malicious contract opened up a payment channel and allowed hackers to enter and exit the contract without the presence of a counter-party. Unfortunately, the native “LCOpenTimeout” function caused only on-chain to be deleted, and let hackers conduct another payment into the same contract; thus creating a loop. By transferring tokens to the smart contract and back, hackers were able to gain ETH equivalent to their initial SPANK balance.SpankChain admitted they decided against a security audit for the payment channel contract, citing expensive cost. The company hired blockchain audit firm Zeppelin for investigating a unidirectional channels library bug but faced a conundrum when the audit’s fee of $17,000 exceeded the funds held by the contract.In conclusion, the team noted all security bugs have been identified and are currently being repaired. Also, they are making it mandatory for multiple “internal” audits for all smart contract codes published on the SpankChain protocol, and “at least” one external audit.For those interested, SpankChain has made public the hacker’s payment channel contract, attacker’s address, internal attacker’s address, malicious contract address.Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, Hacks     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

390,CryptoSlate,Anonymous Twitter User Says They’ll Livestream a 51 Percent Altcoin Attack,John Bogna,1539140400.0,"A Twitter user by the handle GeoCold posted a tweet on Oct. 7 announcing their intention to wage a 51 percent attack against altcoin Einsteinium and live-stream the entire event on Twitch. The user, who credits American hacker George Hotz with the idea to live stream the hack, isn’t coming from a place of malicious intent. Rather, they want to make people aware of just how easy it can be to take over a blockchain with a few dollars of rented hardware. GeoCold has two stated goals: Demonstrate how easy these attacks are for anyone to do, andGenerally, teach people about the nuts and bolts of these attacks and potential mitigations.Oct 13, 3:00 CDT (8:00 UTC) I'm doing 51% attacks against real live CryptoCurrencies and explaining the whole process on twitch. https://t.co/JQm34LrvhW— GeoCold (@geocold51) October 8, 2018What is a 51 Percent Attack?A 51 percent attack occurs when, as the name suggests, an outside user assumes majority control of a targeted blockchain. Cryptocurrencies that operate by ‘Proof of Work’ (PoW) are set up to automatically accept the longest version of the blockchain as the correct version.In a 51 percent attack, a miner can take advantage of that by using greater than half of the blockchain network’s hashing power to send funds to an address on the main blockchain while secretly sending the same funds to an address on a forked copy of that chain. Because they’re in command of the majority of the network’s hashing power, they can create this secret chain, build it longer than the main chain, then release it later. Crypto51, a site set up to explain this attack and its dangers, explains it like this: “Since other nodes only know about the main chain, they will see the first transaction as valid, and exchanges, etc will accept this transaction as valid. This malicious node can later release these silently mined blocks, and other nodes will accept this as the new ‘correct chain’ since it is longer. This will cause the original transaction to effectively disappear, and nodes will recognize the funds as being sent to the address from the new chain instead. This is known as a ‘double spend’ attack.”While bigger coins would take a lot of money to attack because taking over their network would require an incredible amount of computing power, some altcoins like Einsteinium can be attacked for cheap. GeoCold is planning to conduct their attack with $50 USD. Why is this important?51 percent attacks have become increasingly common in 2018, some focusing on higher profile altcoins like Bitcoin Gold and Verge.Related: Verge Victim to Yet Another 51% Attack, XVG Down 15% In Past 24 HoursCoins with a low value, and therefore a typically low hashrate, make easier targets as they don’t take much computing power to gain 51 percent control over. One commenter on GeoCold’s post said 51 percent attacks against small blockchains is “like taking candy from a toddler.” So why do it at all?GeoCold appears to be operating as a kind of “white hat” hacker, bringing attention to the issue so that people designing blockchain networks can see where the weaknesses are and build them stronger. This kind of vulnerability, even if it does make attacking larger coins prohibitively expensive, could still be cause for concern. Amid fears of hacking, scams, and vanishing crypto funds fueled by reports of recent attacks, it makes sense to err on the side of caution.

The move is aimed primarily at the broader public sector in the Gulf state, which comprises locals, regional immigrants, and international expats.Emcredit is a government-owned subsidiary that handles all credit ratings and issuances in the country. Pundi X notes the agency will provide its PoS terminals to “hundreds of storefronts” across the Emirate of Dubai for allowing bills to be paid.Payments will be processed by Emcash, a cryptocurrency launched by Emcredit and operated by Dubai’s Department of Economic Development, on a device specially made for the cause by Pundi X labs. As stated in the release, the yet-to-be-unveiled PoS device is authorized for use only by Ebooc and containing the branding of emCredit.A digital stablecoin-equivalent of the UAE dirham (AED) will be available on the device, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, or even Pundi X’s native PXS token are unavailable for making purchases for now. However, this may soon change if Dubai introduces crypto-regulations in the near future.The announcement confirms Dubai’s push for creating prominence in the cryptocurrency markets, which is led by the likes of Singapore, Malta, and Hong Kong currently. The Emirate aims to break free from an oil- and tourism-dependent economy to a global blockchain innovation center and authority.A spokesperson for credit spokesperson stated the move was carried out in consultation with UAE Prime Minister and Vice President Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. He added:“To be the world’s first city to offer blockchain-based payment solutions to our residents is an exciting moment for Dubai. It confirms Dubai’s status as an international tech hub.”Approvals Remain PendingA rollout of Pundi X’s PoS device is expected to follow the announcement within the week, with provisions for more devices to be introduced to other cities like Abu Dhabi if results are favorable.The CEO and co-founder of Pundi X, Zac Cheah, noted bringing blockchain-based payments technology in partnership with a government body was a “major development” for the sector. He added the development was “historic” as it puts forth a “real-world application” of a promising technology.Meanwhile, further details have yet-to-be-made public and would follow after meticulous testings and approvals are granted by Dubai’s government regulators before the start of 2019.Posted In: United Arab Emirates, Adoption, Altcoins, Stablecoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

With Erasure referred to as the “tinder for markets” by Bloomberg, it has begun attracting more attention within the crypto community.Today, NMR becomes the token for *the entire hedge fund industry*. Introducing Erasure, a protocol for unstoppable data feeds. https://t.co/DqHooQogUd— Numerai (@numerai) October 4, 2018Numerai is a hedge fund built by a network of data scientists. The crowdsourcing platform holds a weekly tournament for data scientists around the world where participants use Numerai’s encrypted data to develop predictions about financial markets. Since its release a year ago, the Numeraire token (NMR) has become one of the most used utility tokens on Ethereum.Erasure will Decentralize NMRIn the Medium announcement of Erasure, CEO Richard Craib wrote about the current problem that NMR is facing, and why they needed to launch Erasure. The NMR token was designed specifically for Numerai, meaning that only Numerai data scientists are using NMR for staking. Only Numerai can buy predictions, destroy stakes and all datasets are uploaded onto Numerai’s servers.Erasure is built on the Ethereum blockchain and works by allowing members to bet on their predictions. Users will stake the NMR token on an outcome–if the prediction comes true they win, if not they lose their tokens.On the Numerai platform, when a data scientist builds a model based on Numerai’s data, the company may then pay for the set. However, with Erasure, they are allowing public access, meaning that the data scientists can sell their predictions to other hedge funds globally. Hedge funds will be able to see proof that their predictions are accurate by using historical data on the Erasure marketplace.Craib explained:“We can look at the performance and metrics and other measures and show that the models that get staked perform far better than the models that don’t get staked because people who stake have some skin in the game.”Erasure will help bring a level of transparency and trust to the industry. Data scientists will be able to build their reputations and hedge funds will have access to immutable data and establish how often their predictions are correct.Posted In: Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Adding More ‘Collections’Following the success of Circle’s ‘buy the market’ feature, where it grouped all the assets listed on the app together for people to one-tap purchase, they’ve added three additional categories—or collections—of crypto assets users can browse: Platforms, Payments, and Privacy.Each category brings the same one-tap purchasing capability to all the assets listed inside it.

Circle blog editor Divya Agarwalla, wrote:“As crypto evolves, more projects will be kicked off to apply blockchain technology to various use cases. As we continue to list the crypto assets associated with the projects on Circle Invest, we will also introduce new collections and relevant educational material so that customers can invest in the categories that most interest them.”All four of Circle’s collections weight crypto assets by market capitalization, according to their blog, meaning that if you choose to buy the assets listed in one tap, you’ll end up with more of the higher-cap assets like BTC, ETH, and XRP in your wallet.This could be a good option for people looking to invest in cryptocurrency and want more of a safe bet, as the feature automatically weights their portfolios with more popular cryptocurrencies that are doing well in the market.Not The Only Company BundlingAccording to TechCrunch, Coinbase launched a similar feature they’ve named Bundles, letting users buy all the coins listed on Coinbase with a few taps of their screen. Coin selection is limited at the moment, but more cryptocurrencies are being added to both Coinbase and Circle regularly, giving potential investors plenty to choose from, especially if they’re just starting out. Circle’s app is available for download on both iOS and Android devices. The app also has an “explore” feature to let you learn more about what’s going on in the market, and how to invest based on your preferences. It offers two-factor authentication, and you can start investing even with only a dollar. Their investors include Goldman Sachs and Bitmain. As of this writing, 11 coins are available for purchase on the app. Posted In: Adoption, Altcoins, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
394,CryptoSlate,Electroneum Becomes First KYC Compliant-Cryptocurrency,John Bogna,1538701200.0,"The makers of mobile-based cryptocurrency Electroneum (ETN) announced today that theirs will be the first fully Know Your Customer (KYC) compliant cryptocurrency in the world. Electronuem’s business strategy has served them well in the past, allowing them to tap into a market of millions in underdeveloped countries by going entirely mobile phone based. The company states on its website that their goal is to connect underserved populations who don’t have access to banks with a means of currency. There are roughly 350 million smartphone users in the world, representing a massive market that the company claims on its website will enable a 3 trillion dollar marketplace.#ETN is now the WORLD’S FIRST KYC-compliant #cryptocurrency. Check out FinTech Finance’s write up of the news here: https://t.co/n1k1hEsrpb— electroneum (@electroneum) October 4, 2018The makers of Electroneum have partnered with London-based app maker Yoti’s digital identity authentication tool to carry out their venture into full KYC compliance. What is KYC?KYC is especially important in the crypto world to combat claims of lax security and user anonymity connected with digital currencies. People want to know who they’re sending their money to, and that it’s being used for the intended purpose. One of the most common arguments for KYC is that these regulations make it harder to finance terrorism and other illicit activities. KYC commonly involves collecting information from customers that use a service like their name, address, citizenship, date of birth, and a government-issued ID. The process is similar to the application for a U.S. passport and is designed to form a complete picture of a person that’s hard to fake. How will Electroneum use it?According to the publication FinTech Finance, Yoti will partner with Electroneum’s developers to create an app-based KYC protocol users can follow when sending or receiving ETN from their mobile wallets. Richard Ells, founder and CEO of Electroneum, said in an interview that: “This will help us evolve from a cryptocurrency into a recognized means of digital payment like PayPal or Apple Pay, which will enable us to help our core market: smartphone users in developing and emerging countries.”Related: Civic Partners With Brave to Bring Reusable KYC Verification to Verified PublishersElectroneum claims that Yoti’s protocol will let users verify their identity in seconds, much like the partnership Brave Software recently integrated into its browser for its verified publisher service.According to Tom White of Yoti, users will only need to create their Yoti profile one time, after which it can be used to repeatedly confirm their identity “in seconds” any time it’s needed. KYC technology will most likely be on the rise in the cryptocurrency space, especially as both state and federal regulators ramp up their efforts to crack down on fraud and shut down the companies responsible. Security has also been a very tall hurdle to crypto’s mainstream adoption that KYC tech, especially solutions that are fast and easy to use, could help to leap.ETN users are required to be compliant by November 12, 2018, but voluntary registration is available now.Posted In: Adoption, Altcoins, KYC     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

396,CryptoSlate,Three Fraudulent Crypto Companies Sanctioned by North Dakota Government,John Bogna,1538478000.0,"On Sept. 26th, North Dakota Securities Commissioner Karen Tyler issued cease and desist orders for three companies in her state that may have been offering fraudulent ICOs. The North Dakota Securities Department’s official release states that these orders were issued as part of an ongoing operation called Operation Cryptosweep, a multi-jurisdiction operation involving over 40 securities regulators in the U.S. and Canada. “The expanding exploitation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem by financial criminals is a significant threat to Main Street investors. Financial criminals are cashing in on the hype and excitement around blockchain, crypto assets, and ICOs – investors should be exceedingly cautious when considering a related investment.”BitConnect in hot water againThe three companies listed in the release and issued cease and desist orders were BitConnect and related companies BitConnect LTD and BitConnect International PLC, Magma Foundation and related companies Magma Coin and Magma, and Pension Rewards Platform, aka Pension Rewards.BitConnect has been in the news for defrauding its investors before, in other states like Colorado and Texas. Tyler cautions that for now, the BitConnect site remains accessible in her state and that you should not invest in their company. Tyler points to the fact that they offer a 120 percent rate of return on an investment in their tokens as an example of their bad behavior, stating that the company is not licensed to offer securities in ND and that their claim is “unsubstantiated and misleading.”John Oliver featured BitConnect as a prime example of the kind of dangerous fraud that can take place in the largely unregulated environment of cryptocurrency investment. The video clip of overenthusiastic spokesman, Carlos Matos, yelling “BITCONNEEEECT” he used in his segment on cryptocurrency has become a meme. In short, the company has become synonymous with cryptocurrency investment fraud. The company shut down in January 2018, and the alleged founder was arrested in August.Magma and Pension RewardsMagma is also still currently active and available to the residents of ND, though Tyler states in her release that images used to depict the company heads are fraudulent and that those employees are also assigned fake names. Their site also claims additional “fraudulent information,” unsubstantiated claims, and is not registered in the state to provide securities.Pension Rewards sells itself as a marketplace for freelancers, using a token called “Pcoin” or “$Pcoin” as its currency and connecting members of the gig economy to opportunities for work. It echoes the other two companies in its claims that investors will see incredible return in very little time, providing no proof of these claims. According to Tyler, they do not disclose material financial or risk information to their investors, a massive red flag. They are also unregistered in ND. How to spot bad ICOsTyler lays out some common red flags raised by sketchy ICOs in her release and provides some additional material potential investors can use to educate themselves. One common red flag according to her is the use of plagiarized white papers, which usually contain spelling errors and errors in translation. These fake white papers can also use false celebrity endorsements, stock photos taken from online, or addresses and phone numbers that don’t check out. Of course, another thing they all have in common is the promise of a ridiculously high reward for virtually no risk.

397,CryptoSlate,Zcash (ZEC) Hash Rate Rises Over 13 Percent in One Day Ahead of Sapling Launch,Shaurya Malwa,1538388660.0,"Privacy cryptocurrency Zcash received a hash rate boost on Sept. 30 with a 13 percent rise ahead of its much-awaited Sapling protocol upgrade.A network’s hash rate has historically indicated rising miner interest in a particular coin. More mining groups join a coin’s network ahead of a significant upgrade, fork, or other technology development, resulting in heightened network security and increased asset prices.For the uninitiated, a network’s hash rate displays the amount of computing power governing a cryptocurrency network at any instant. As blockchain systems are fundamentally decentralized, network security depends on the number of computers validating nodes, solving complex cryptographic problems, and protecting the network to earn the prized “block reward.” The larger network’s hash rate, the more secure the system.Now, with the Sapling protocol upcoming, the robust Zcash protocol has received a security boost, but not a significant increase in ZEC prices yet. Hash rates for the network rose 13 percent within 24 hours on Sept. 30.$ZEC hashrate up a massive 13% today. Wow! Expect much more hashrate to come online in leadup to @zcashco and the Sapling hardfork. pic.twitter.com/ANllLfsrXn— Steven D. McKie (@Steven_McKie) October 1, 2018Sapling aims to introduce code improvements for increasing transactional efficiency for “shielded” transactions that promote the growth of exchange, vendor, and mobile outlets for ZEC payments.As per details, payments with the new Sapling Z-addresses can be completed “in a few seconds” and require only 40 megabytes of memory. Also, the much-revered zero-knowledge proof feature of Zcash would be independent of the hardware that signs for the transaction, after the upgrade. Full viewing keys allow owners of shielded addresses the ability to view incoming and outgoing transaction details without exposing their private spending key.With renewed interest in the Zcash protocol, it remains to be seen if investor interest increases in the coming few days. The price and hash rate moves may not be immediate either; Sapling does not go live until Oct. 29 on activation block 419200, assuming a block time of 150 seconds/block.

With the addition, Wanchain joins an exhaustive list of cryptocurrencies supported by the Trust Wallet–including obscure ERC20 and ERC223 tokens.Malta-based Binance acquired Trust in July 2018 for an undisclosed amount, with many batting an eyelid on the latter’s lack of userbase. However, Trust Wallet is committed towards responsible, decentralization asset management and does not hold funds on native servers.Instead, it allows the anonymous storage of crypto-assets via an Ethereum-based wallet on the user’s mobile phone. Additionally, the application is said to have undergone a “bank-level” audit, which can be accessed here.The audit helps generate trust in the integrity and safety of the wallet application. At the user end, an additional level of security is provided to protect against theft of phone – such as personal biometric login and mandatory pin to access.Another exciting feature of Trust Wallet is of allowing users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and exchanges (DEXs) seamlessly, due to its vast support of all ERC20 tokens.The development is the third crypto-wallet to support WAN tokens, with only Portal Network’s iOS wallet and Wanchain’s WanWallet being the two other dedicated wallet offerings. The former allows users with a Wanchain Name Service feature that, similar to Ethereum’s Domain Name Service, will enable users to transact WAN by using “yourname.wan.”Meanwhile, Wanchain continues to develop its ambitious platform. The interoperability feature aims to simplify modern finance by providing fast settlement of loans, asset exchanges, multi-asset ICOs, and other asset management capabilities.Currently, Wanchain 2.0 extends the cross-chain functionalities for the Ethereum blockchain, but come Wanchain 3.0, and the same features shall be extended for Bitcoin and related applications.Posted In: Ethereum, Binance, Malta, Altcoins, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
399,CryptoSlate,Monero Patches ‘Burning Bug’,John Bogna,1537920000.0,"In a post-mortem report released on their website on Tuesday, the developers of Monero say they were able to patch a potentially serious bug that would’ve allowed malicious users to ‘burn’ cryptocurrency exchange deposits.A Post Mortem of The Burning Bug: https://t.co/Iqii03G3DJ— Monero || #xmr (@monero) September 25, 2018This burning would be achieved by users flooding the same stealth address with multiple payments, effectively rendering the funds in the account unusable, because after the initial request all other requests would be rejected as suspicious. The only thing the malicious user would lose is transaction fees paid to whatever exchange the wallet they’re attacking is a part of. Breaking down the bugThe report explains the bug as follows: “The bug basically entails the wallet not providing a warning when it receives a burnt output. Therefore, a determined attacker could burn the funds of an organization’s wallet whilst merely losing network transaction fees.”Because of the way a key image is generated when sending Monero, multiple requests would result in multiple, identical key images, causing every subsequent transaction to be rejected. An attacker would do this by modifying the code to send the same private key every time, generating the duplicate public keys and causing the system to reject the transactions after the first.The burnt stealth address the requests are being sent to would only be usable once, rendering everything else as good as gone. This is how Monero breaks it down in detail:“An attacker first generates a random private transaction key. Thereafter, they modify the code to merely use this particular private transaction key, which ensures multiple transactions to the same public address (e.g. an exchange’s hot wallet) are sent to the same stealth address. Subsequently, they send, say, a thousand transactions of 1 XMR to an exchange. Because the exchange’s wallet does not warn for this particular abnormality (i.e. funds being received on the same stealth address), the exchange will, as usual, credit the attacker with 1000 XMR. The attacker then sells his XMR for BTC and lastly withdraws this BTC. The result of the hacker’s action(s) is that the exchange is left with 999 unspendable / burnt outputs of 1 XMR.”How they found itThe bug was, according to Monero’s report, discovered by a community member’s hypothetical description of this attack on the Monero subreddit.Once the Monero dev team saw the danger in this bug and that it could actually be exploited, they issued a patch and notified as many merchants, exchanges, and services using Monero as they could so they could install it. The developers also informed everyone on their public mailing list of the danger and patch. Monero says that while some damage was done, the bug has not affected the protocol or the coin supply. They ended their post-mortem with a word of caution: that cryptocurrency technology is still vulnerable to critical bugs, and that everyone in the community should do their best to stay informed.

Coinbase also intends to accept minimal fees, if needed in the future, to cover legal and operational costs in integrating new cryptocurrencies.The Coinbase team stated:“Today we’re announcing a new process that will allow us to rapidly list most digital assets that are compliant with local law, by satisfying listing requests in a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction manner. In practice, this means some new assets listed on our platform may only be available to customers in select jurisdictions for a period of time.”Monumental DecisionCompared to other exchanges such as Binance and Bittrex, Coinbase has been more cautious in adding new cryptocurrencies onto its platform. As one of the most regulated exchanges in the global market alongside US-based Gemini and Bittrex, the exchange has focused on working with financial regulators and authorities to improve the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency market.The company’s focus on compliance naturally led the Coinbase team to create products that can handle the demand from institutional investors, as seen in the release of Coinbase Custody in July.Related:  Coinbase Custody Explores New Assets and Coinbase Commerce Launches Plug-in for Online StoresWith Coinbase Custody established and a strong customer service department in place, which the exchange was criticized for in its early days, the company is moving forward with its plans to integrate more digital assets on its platform to provide liquidity to the global market and more investment opportunities to its investors.Already projects are permitted to apply with Coinbase utilizing the “Digital Asset Framework,” a set of criteria that the exchange will use to determine whether digital assets meet the demands of US regulators and the exchange.The team said:“With this shift in process, our customers can expect us to list most assets over time that meet our standards. Because listing announcements will become more frequent, we expect to publicly announce the addition of new assets only at or near the time of public launch across one or more Coinbase products.”0x and BAT Surged After Coinbase AnnouncementOn July 13, Coinbase announced that it is exploring the integration of Cardano, Basic Attention Token, Stellar Lumens, Zcash, and 0x, as the first batch of cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin.Initially, the announcement of Coinbase led all five cryptocurrencies to massively surge in price and volume, but their strong momentum was short lived as the community realized that the integration of new assets on Coinbase is expected to be a long process.The announcement read:“Unlike the ongoing process of adding Ethereum Classic, which is technically very similar to Ethereum, these assets will require additional exploratory work and we cannot guarantee they will be listed for trading.”Price MovementWithin the past 24 hours, 0x (ZRX) has increased from $0.6 to $0.667. Although 0x and BAT have since retraced slightly since then, an abrupt 10 percent increase in the price of 0x has demonstrated the optimism of investors towards the integration of five digital assets Coinbase introduced back in July.Related: BAT-Enabled Brave Browser Hits 10 Million DownloadsBAT, the native cryptocurrency of the Brave Browser, which already has more than 3 million users and 30,000 content creators, has also increased by around 8 percent against both the US dollar and Bitcoin following the release of the statement of Coinbase.On Sept. 25, the crypto market demonstrated a large loss in valuation as the price of Bitcoin dropped by around 4 percent and XRP saw a wipeout of $9 billion from its valuation.The recovery of ZRX, ADA, and BAT during a downward market trend has shown the community’s interest towards the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the global market pursuing its plans to support more assets for its investors.Posted In: Coinbase, San Francisco, Altcoins, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Kira Sun, an investment manager at China-based blockchain investment firm BlockVC, stated that he believes the bear market on Bitcoin to be at an end, but that altcoins will take longer to recover.One of the biggest funds in China is @blockvcfund. Their thesis is that BTC has found a bottom but that Alts have 200 days plus to go. Starts at 35:00.https://t.co/N3EtrpOe4c— Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) September 24, 2018Sun has prior experience at CITIC Trust as a fund manager and a background in alternative asset management. During an interview with CNBC at an event hosted by BlockVC at Singapore Blockchain Week, he shared his thoughts on Bitcoin and the future of the market. 200 Days Left to GoWhen asked if he thought we’d reached the bottom of the bear market, Sun responded: “I think it depends on how you understand the market structure. We think for Bitcoin itself it has reached a bottom, but for the other cryptocurrencies, it’s far from the end. We think the bearish market is going to be lasting for more than 200 days for cryptocurrency other than bitcoin.” Sun says these predictions, particularly for BTC, are based on observations of the blockchain network and tracking BTC transactions. Sun believes that BTC is now being traded at what he calls a “reasonable value,” a fair market value based on fundamental analysis of blockchain transactions.Sun said:“We calculate the net transaction value of Bitcoin and we think the Bitcoin price has no bubble, now,” He followed that up by cautioning that Bitcoin could still face a slight dip, but seemed assured that it has stabilized and hit the bottom of its downward fall. Block VC analyzed past cycles in the cryptocurrency market to come up with the 200-day timeline. Sun claims that analyses of full market cycles show full symmetry between their downward and upward periods. Since we’ve had a downward trend of 200 days, we still have another 200 left before we’ll see a rise in the market again, according to Block VC’s analysis.‘Diversify your portfolio’Instead of dumping everything for Bitcoin, Sun recommends transferring your Ethereum into a diversified portfolio consisting of at least five different coins such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum:“As a…professional portfolio manager, I would stress you to transfer your ETH into a diversified portfolio consisting of more than five components, like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum EOS; you have to build a very diversified portfolio to mitigate the risk, and provide downward risk protection for yourself.”Posted In: Bitcoin, China, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

To relayers, Solidity devs, UX designers, market makers, community members, dApp devs, and others. By gathering all of this feedback, we have been able to include features in 0x protocol v2.0 that will pleasantly surprise developers, bring a new wave of high-quality projects onto 0x, and set up the system for future upgrades and improvements through governance.”Related: Coinbase’s New Listing Candidates: What Are Cardano, Basic Attention Token, Stellar Lumens, Zcash, and 0x?An already hugely popular framework for building decentralized exchanges of nearly any blockchain-based digital asset on the Ethereum network 0x was announced as a future potential addition to Coinbase alongside other up-and-comers in the crypto space like Brave’s Basic Attention Token (BAT).The San Francisco company recently added David Sacks, former COO of PayPal, founder of Yammer, and co-founder of investment group Craft Ventures, to its advisory board. Some of the relayers building on 0x include trading platforms Ethfinex, Radar, and Paradex, according to the 0x project website.So what’s next?According to the 0x project blog, a few of the main changes for version 2.0 include a new architecture for smart contracts, more efficient mapping of exchange orders, support for new types of digital signatures and identity verification, and the addition of “filter contracts” and “permissioned liquidity pools.”The latter item only offers access to a pool of assets to Ethereum addresses that are able to meet certain criteria. Relayers can set these requirements themselves, opting in to apply sets of permissions. 0x will also change the way its protocol interacts with contracts–the current method of one proxy contract per exchange works well for ERC-20 assets but doesn’t scale, according to 0x’s Tom Shmidt. Version 2.0 will use different asset proxies for different asset types.Schmidt says:“This way we can add support for new token standards as they come out without having to redeploy a single Proxy — we just need to deploy a new AssetProxy for a particular standard.”Currently, the 0x team has fifteen relayers facilitating trades with the company’s ERC-20 token, with more reportedly beta-testing the protocol.   0x 7 Nov at 2:44 am UTC$0.28  1.11%0x, currently ranked #36 by market cap, is up 1.11% over the past 24 hours.

Blowing out its first birthday candle, however, the Singapore-based project has outlined a host of new enhancements it believes will bring this self-imposition to fruition.Performance and Scalability EnhancementsHaving implemented SegWit by default, Qtum claims its new version as its “most substantial update yet” that will eventually permit 50,000 transactions per second through the use of lightning networks, and a number of tune-ups including faster synchronization of nodes and SHA256 hashing efficiency improvements.Equally as weighty may be its ambition to launch its first public testnet for x86 smart contracts in Q2 2019 — which would see support for a host of scripting languages including C, C++, Rust, and Python, supposedly lower the barrier to entry for developers, and ultimately vindicate Qtum’s goal of opening up blockchain technology to the masses.To Qtum, x86 may be a breakthrough imperative for blockchain’s adoption. They write:“We consider this to be similar to those advances made in the early 2000’s which allowed the internet to become what it is today.

405,CryptoSlate,Civic Partners With Brave to Bring Reusable KYC Verification to Verified Publishers,John Bogna,1537599600.0,"At Consumer Identity World Tour 2018, identity verification software company Civic announced a partnership with Brave Software, in which verified publishers using Brave’s platform and Ethereum-based Basic Attention Token (BAT) will be able to verify their identities using Civic’s interface.We're excited to announce that we will be working with @civickey to offer secure identity verification services on our publisher platform. https://t.co/qErcA34gyd— Brave Software (@brave) September 21, 2018An Attention-Based Payment EcosystemBrave’s main offering is its secure web browser, which it uses to host a group of verified content creators called “publishers” in addition to normal web browsing functions. Brave claims to cut out the middleman between content creators and their audiences by offering users the chance to pay their favorite publishers in BAT, rather than deal with advertising. Related: BAT-Enabled Brave Browser Hits 10 Million DownloadsThis, says Brave, lets creators take home much more of the money they make online than in an online environment like YouTube, where conventional ad revenue only creates profit when a user repeatedly hits hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of views.When someone signs up to be a verified publisher on the Brave platform, they also set up a digital wallet and receive regular payments in BAT. Users agree to pay a set amount every month, and Brave automatically keeps track of the publishers they visit the most, then divides that set amount according to the publishers whom that user has shown the most attention. Hence, “Basic Attention Token.”Built-in Identity Verification for CreatorsUnder the terms of the agreement with Civic, the service will only be available to users who provide Ethereum wallets as a means of accepting payment. Those publishers will then be able to utilize Civic’s reusable “know-your-customer (KYC)” identity verification via a smartphone app.Civic claims its service allows for verification without harvesting unnecessary data and will let publishers verify their ID via smartphone whenever they log in to collect their tokens.Speaking on the partnership, Brendan Eich, CEO of Brave, said: “Brave and the Basic Attention Token aim to directly connect users and publishers in a transparent system to guarantee privacy and authenticity, without the intermediaries that harvest user data. Civic shares our values around privacy and protecting user information, and we’re excited to work with them to offer Civic Reusable KYC, which will be key to ensuring security and privacy on our publisher network”According to the company, there are currently 21,000 verified publishers using Brave’s platform, and the partnership with Civic should make it easier for those publishers to verify their identity and collect their earnings from the platform. Most recently, Brave made The Wall Street Journal’s “2018 Tech Companies to Watch” list and recently hit 10 million downloads.Posted In: Altcoins, KYC, Privacy, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
406,CryptoSlate,Zaif Exchange Hack in Japan Provokes Security Caution From NEM,Trevor Ballanger,1537585200.0,"While the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Zaif faces backlash following a Sept. 14 hack, the NEM.io Foundation, known for the NEM blockchain platform and XEM token, has reassured its asset holders that it remains unaffected.Nem Suspends Zaif WithdrawalsDuring the hack, holdings in Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and MonaCoin (MONA) were subject to stolen funds. The security rupture resulted in a theft of 6.7 billion yen ($60 million USD), requiring the trading company to terminate its deposit and withdrawal platforms until a comprehensive investigation is performed.In a statement, the company said it is pursuing the hack as a criminal case in cooperation with the Financial Services Agency, investigation authorities and the communications software company Kaichi Corporation.Abnormalities within the server were detected Sept. 14 and confirmed the following day when a report was filed with the Treasury Department.Representatives for Zaif said:“Currently, we are checking and strengthening security, rebuilding the server, etc., in order to restart the system of depositing/withdrawing virtual currency. We are committed to restoration as soon as possible, so please wait for a while. Moreover, I sincerely apologize for any inconveniences that may arise.”NEM Foundation spokesperson Alexandra Tinsman urged cryptocurrency companies within its community to operate only the proper security measures established, including “multi-factor” authentication and hardware wallets. She added that all withdrawals sought from Zaif have been suspended in light of the investigation.BREAKING NEWS: Multi-signature technology ensures protection and integrity of $XEM– and #NEM-based holdings after #Zaif exchange security incidenthttps://t.co/pEQcmtzFKE— NEM (@NEMofficial) September 20, 2018Related: Introduction to NEM (XEM): The Proof-of-Importance CoinRegistered in Singapore, the NEM blockchain platform is designed for enterprises built on an EigenTrust algorithm, a reputation system for peer-to-peer networks.

The dip has people asking just what went wrong after this initial peak in users. What’s causing Augur’s popularity as a forecasting platform to die off?Looking for AnswersAugur had 25 users in the last 24 hours.Roughly one person per hour.That's a 90% drop in users since launch week back in July.Augur is currently the 44th ranked ETH dApp by users. pic.twitter.com/I8fGLKxLcx— Kevin Rooke (@kerooke) September 19, 2018Twitter user Kevin Rooke noticed the trend and asked people directly why they were disenchanted with Augur, or just chose not to use it.The answers he got seemed to indicate that people either thought using the app was too risky due to its association with gambling, the app’s interface was too time-consuming and cumbersome or people who would be interested in a forecasting app would rather use one specifically designed for gambling, like Wagerr, instead.

Had interest but that was a barrier that I didn’t care to get passed. Hope the feedback helps!— Crypto Max (@Max_Newton) September 20, 2018What is Augur?Augur is an open source prediction market application built to use both the Ethereum blockchain and cryptocurrency. Through the app, users can create their own trading markets for any outcome they desire as well as trade currency based on what they believe the result of that event will be. Users can also set a closing date when they create the market, and once it closes the winners are paid.For example, some of the current open markets are betting on the price of gold, how many platinum singles Ariana Grande will be awarded in 2019 and the outcome of an upcoming football game; people can literally bet on anything they want. Since the markets are decentralized, they can’t be censored or shut down by any one party. The system, theoretically, runs itself by keeping track of currency traded, the closing dates of markets and distributing payouts to the winners. Augur was built around the idea that the larger, more diverse a group of people with the ability to input information into a system, the more accurate the information obtained by that system will be.Websites like Quora use this principle to answer people’s questions, the idea being that someone out there will have the right answer given the vastness of the internet. Related: Users Bet on Celebrity Assassinations on Augur Prediction MarketsAugur takes this principle and applies it to predicting the outcome of events. However, the decentralized, uncensored nature of the app can lead to some darker markets being created, such as when people created markets to predict the likelihood of celebrity assassinations or how long certain politicians would survive.To combat this, Augur has enabled certain users to be “reporters” to flag darker markets as unethical, flagging them for developers.The Future of AugurMost recently, Augur released version 1.5 and the developers, who call themselves the Forecast Foundation, say version 2.0 is on the way, describing some possible bug fixes in a recent Medium post as well as promising full details on the new build in the near future.Augur Weekly Report – September 19th #ethereum #augurhttps://t.co/STrP17wUgv— Augur (@AugurProject) September 20, 2018Forecasting apps that try to solve the problems of centralization and censorship facing current prediction markets still have a ways to go. To remain decentralized, users have to sync to a local node, which takes a prohibitive amount of time in current versions of the Augur app. Since users have to download the app, sync it to a node, buy and load ETH to their account, create markets to trade in and pay transaction fees, using something like Augur remains, for the moment, appealing to only those well-versed in cryptocurrency.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

408,CryptoSlate,Hackers Using Software Vulnerability Stolen From the NSA to Illicitly Mine Crypto,John Bogna,1537322400.0,"In a 25-page report released Wednesday, the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) detailed the worrying rise of illicit cryptocurrency mining in 2018; specifically, how hackers are using a software vulnerability leaked from the NSA last year to do it. ‘They’re Drinking Your Milkshake’Hackers appear to be gaining entry to users’ systems the same way ransomware was implanted on so many computers during the 2017 WannaCry attacks: Through a vulnerability in outdated Windows operating systems, dubbed “Eternal Blue” by the NSA.The vulnerability was leaked in 2017 alongside other stolen NSA documents by the Shadow Brokers hacker group. The resulting attacks impacted Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) and other public institutions worldwide.Our latest @CyberAlliance Joint Analysis has been released, highlighting the Illicit Cryptocurrency Mining Threat. And yes, they’re definitely drinking your milkshake. https://t.co/wjh5JvjYaT Thread!— Neil Jenkins (@nejenkins) September 19, 2018According to the report, the malware detection the hackers use to steal computing power from unknowing users for illicit mining has seen more than a 400 percent surge since 2017.In a blog post announcing the report, entitled “They’re Drinking Your Milkshake,” Neil Jenkins, chief analytical officer at the CTA, spells out how much illicit mining has exploded and why this is such a problem:“…illicit mining is the ‘canary in the coal mine’ of cybersecurity threats. If illicit cryptocurrency mining is taking place on your network, then you most likely have worse problems and we should consider the future of illicit mining as a strategic threat. More sophisticated actors could use–or may already by using–that same access to lay the groundwork for you to have a really bad day.”Why You Should CareAdding to his sentiment, Jenkins says that an influx of illegal currency into the crypto market could devalue it due to the sheer volume of new units created.Monero, for example, appears to be at the top of the list for currencies being targeted, with 85 percent of illicit mining operations manufacturing its token, followed by Bitcoin at 8 percent and other altcoins, which account for the final 7 percent, according to Bloomberg.Related: Answering Vitalik Buterin’s 7 Hard Questions For the Blockchain World Part 3: Hacks, Security and TheftPer the CTA’s findings, illegal mining is the “canary in the coal mine” of cybersecurity threats because it points to other weaknesses and vulnerabilities already present in the systems facing hacks. A year on from Microsoft’s release of the patch for Eternal Blue, older, unpatched systems are still being hacked and other backdoors have been released as part of the stolen NSA documents. Jenkins argues that this points to a broader problem with patching and keeping up with cybersecurity standards—or what the CTA report dubs as “cyber hygiene.”Both the wide accessibility and the ease of use of these system weaknesses means novice malevolent hackers can use them to hijack machines for illicit mining with “little upfront work or knowledge,” according to the CTA fact sheet. Hacked computers can experience physical damage from overheating parts and slowdown from damaged data. Hacking tools, however, are becoming more sophisticated, with some not using much CPU power or ceasing operations when they detect mouse movement so that they can remain undetected for as long as possible on a host machine.What You Can Do About ItPeople who’ve already downloaded the patch appear to be safe, at least from the exploitation of the Eternal Blue vulnerability, according to Microsoft Senior Director Jeff Jones, who said in an interview with Bloomberg:“A security update was released in March 2017. Customers who applied the update are protected.”The CTA report offers guidelines to follow and precautions people can take to protect themselves from the proliferation of this and other hacking efforts–including monitoring CPU power usage for unusual consumption, strict system privilege policies to control access to vulnerable data and checking running processes on your machine for command text used by mining malware. The CTA predicts this threat will increase in the near future, and strongly recommends protecting your system now. Per the report:“Given these potential impacts, illicit cryptocurrency mining is not a victimless or harmless activity. Individuals and enterprises must counter this threat.”Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, Hacks     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
409,CryptoSlate,Basic Attention Token (BAT) Parent Company Files Privacy Complaint Against Google,Shaurya Malwa,1536886800.0,"Earlier this week, privacy browser Brave took a rather bold step by filing a privacy complaint against Google in the U.K. and Eire. While Brave’s intentions remain unknown, one must ask: Were the complaints lodged for the greater good or does it represent a publicity stunt?Brave’s Push for the Greater GoodRelated: A Brave New Browser: Is BAT Coinbase’s Next Add?Launched in 2017 by Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich, Brave was one of the most-awaited projects last year and raised a record $32 million within 30 seconds of launching its ICO.The browser features inbuilt ad-blocking software. It’s native cryptocurrency, Basic Attention Token (BAT), meanwhile, allows users to access advertisements, pay content creators and earn money for surfing the web. The browser also helps cut data usage by streamlining user behavior and loading less information per webpage.According to Reuters, Brave’s complaint highlighted Google’s infamous practice of storing customer data, deploying “cookies” (behavior trackers) and leveraging sensitive information to generate revenue.Such “wide-scale and systematic breaches” conducted by Google, and other advertisement industry players, voided fundamental customer privacy acts, which led Brave to pursue the case with legal authorities.The complaint added that, while using the Google browser, a user’s personal information can be broadcasted to “tens or hundreds” of companies, with users unaware that all of the advertisements they view are, in fact, targeted information as a result of their browsing behavior.EU Laws EnforcedIn its complaint, Brave is trying to enforce the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which could spur a formal EU investigation into Google’s business practices should court authorities consider the matter.Johnny Ryan, chief policy officer at Brave, stated:“There is a massive and systematic data breach at the heart of the behavioral advertising industry. Despite the two-year lead-in period before the GDPR, adtech companies have failed to comply.”Administered in 2018, the GDPR is a strict set of laws to protect customer data from the hands of corporate giants. The legislation is specific to 28 countries in the EU and applicable to all data originating in the region and utilized beyond it.Google, meanwhile, has reportedly deployed strong privacy protections after consulting with EU lawmakers, making Brave’s complaint an embarrassing development if no fallacies are found.Brave’s business practice seeks to eliminate intermediaries in the ad industry, with Eich being a popular naysayer of Google’s practices.

Bitcoin 7 Nov at 2:54 am UTC$6,303.24  -1.11%Bitcoin, currently ranked #1 by market cap, is down 1.11% over the past 24 hours. BTC has a market cap of $108.79B with a 24 hour volume of $3.58B.Bitcoin Price Chart  Bitcoin Holds $6,000 Support LevelBitcoin has demonstrated significant volatility over the last several months, ranging from $6,000 to the upper limits of $9,000. Throughout April, June, and August, Bitcoin values plummeted to $6,000, before returning to $7,300 on Sept. 4.A major sell-off on Sept. 5, however, resulted in an immediate and dramatic drop in Bitcoin prices, with total cryptocurrency market cap losing $12 billion in a matter of hours. The sudden sell-off was linked to the movement of almost $1 billion in Bitcoin distributed from wallet addresses linked to now-defunct dark web black market platform Silk Road, as well as well as the purported cancellation of a potential Goldman Sachs crypto trading desk.Related: Bitcoin Trading Desk: Goldman Sachs CFO Says Speculation Is ‘Fake News’Goldman Sachs CFO Martin Chavez was quick to decry any correlation between the rapid Bitcoin price drop and the investment bank as “fake news,” but further negative price action on Sept. 9 saw the value of Bitcoin drop to $6,200.Late Sept. 9, however, Bitcoin exhibited a sudden and unexpected rally, surging 4 percent from $6,190 to $6,450 in less than a minute. While Bitcoin has not yet moved beyond the $6,000 support level that has been tested multiple times over the last three months, a complete recovery from the sub $6,500 level could potentially catalyze a mid-term rally.   Ethereum 7 Nov at 2:54 am UTC$195.65  -2.62%Ethereum, currently ranked #2 by market cap, is down 2.62% over the past 24 hours. ETH has a market cap of $19.93B with a 24 hour volume of $1.46B.Ethereum Price Chart  Ethereum Stabilizes Above $200The last week of bearish market action has shaken investor confidence in Ethereum, which fell to a yearly low of $185 on Sept. 9. The Sept. 5 Bitcoin sell-off dragged Ethereum prices down from a stable point in the $280 range to below $260, at which point statements made by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin regarding the end of explosive growth within the cryptocurrency industry resulted in further price devaluation, placing ETH at $220 on Sept. 7.Related: Vitalik Buterin Proclaims an End to Explosive Growth as ETH Values Plummet: How Will Ethereum Recover?Community speculation regarding a potential large-scale market dump driven by initial coin offerings liquidating significant amounts of Ethereum further demoralized skittish market participants, culminating in a 10-hour sell-off that drove ETH down to $185 on Sept. 9.Market participant concerns regarding ICO-driven ETH sell-offs are not unfounded — in the last month, DigixDAO liquidated 139,400 ETH, placing additional pressure on the market. Ethereum prices have now stabilized above the $200 psychological support level but extended bearish action places ETH in a vulnerable position that could see prices test the $170 support level should the market fail to resist selling interest near the $210.00, $230.00, and $250.00 resistances.ConclusionThe global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $195.12B with a 24 hour volume of $10.76B. Bitcoin dominance is currently at 55.76%.The week-long bearish trend saw both Bitcoin and Ethereum drop in price dramatically, dragging down altcoins across the board in a chaotic sell-off.  Recent market movements, however, have reflected predictions made by ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees in late August, who stated that the crypto market is “done with a majority of the collapse.”Posted In: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Altcoins, Price Watch     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
411,CryptoSlate,Vitalik Buterin Proclaims an End to Explosive Growth as ETH Values Plummet: How Will Ethereum Recover?,Sam Town,1536468000.0,"Ethereum prices have plummeted over the last week, experiencing a drop in value of over 30% amidst a bloodbath that has shaved $50 billion off the cumulative cryptocurrency market cap. With ETH prices hovering around the $200 mark, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin announced the end of the age explosive growth within the cryptocurrency industry.Related: Altcoins Igniting But Ethereum Founder Isn’t Ready for LiftoffButerin’s statements, released to Bloomberg earlier this week at a Hong Kong blockchain conference, reinforce the Ethereum founder’s technologist perspective on the cryptocurrency market — Buterin has previously emphasized the negative impact of rampant speculation on the blockchain ecosystem.Buterin remarked:“If you talk to the average educated person at this point, they probably have heard of blockchain at least once. There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore. That strategy is getting close to hitting a dead end.”Blockchain Industry Growth Headed Toward ‘Dead End’The blockchain space, states Buterin, is reaching a point where there’s a ceiling in sight as the average educated person has “probably heard of blockchain at least once.” Buterin isn’t wrong about the rapidly increasing level of international blockchain awareness — recent statistics released by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) reveal that more than 50 percent of all Americans are aware of cryptocurrencies.As consumer awareness of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency reaches a saturation point, argues the Ethereum co-founder, the possibility of capturing an opportunity for 1,000-times growth in “anything in the space” is virtually nonexistent.Related: Crypto Adoption Frenzy: More Than Half of Americans Familiar with Bitcoin, Litecoin and EthereumButerin highlights the factors driving growth within the cryptocurrency industry — the blockchain ecosystem has largely relied on market efforts focused on boosting widespread adoption and awareness. With consumer awareness now at an all-time high, the current blockchain growth strategy is “getting close to hitting a dead end.”Buterin’s statements have exacerbated a sharp and sudden drop in Ethereum prices, with ETH breaking the $200 floor to $188 on Sunday, a low not seen since July 2017. Investor confidence has been shaken further by concerns of a potential “ICO dump” that would see hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH flood the market as initial coin offerings liquidate large sums of Ethereum in an attempt to minimize losses.The future of Ethereum, states Buterin, depends not on marketing efforts geared toward further adoption but instead depends on focusing on generating interest in the real-world applications and economic benefits of blockchain technology.Ethereum Isn’t Ready for Real-World Applications at ScaleBlockchain technology may promise to decentralize virtually everything and provide consumers with the tangible economic benefits that Buterin states will drive interest in the blockchain industry — but the Ethereum project is not yet at a stage of development at which it is able to support large-scale consumer interest.The primary obstacle faced by the Ethereum project is scalability. There are already hundreds of decentralized applications that are able to present a strong use case and a functional proof of concept, but the Ethereum network, touted as the go-to platform for dApps, is currently unable to support dApp use at scale.Related: MyCrypto Condemns Chinese Exchange For Spamming and Congesting EthereumEarlier this year, the Ethereum network was severely handicapped by the actions of a single cryptocurrency exchange. Creating a network that is able to support the same level of use as Uber, for example, would require a significant upgrade to current Ethereum technology.With Uber boasting over 4 billion rides booked per year, any dApp aiming to compete on the Ethereum blockchain would require a transaction throughput far higher than what Ethereum currently offers.Where Does Ethereum Go From Here?The future of Ethereum scalability, however, looks bright. The Ethereum 2.0 Roadmap, recently revealed by Rocketpool, features second-layer scaling solutions and a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism that is set to significantly improve Ethereum transaction throughput speed.Related: Rocket Pool Reveals Roadmap for Ethereum 2.0Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, speaking at Asian tech conference Rise on July 10, highlighted the scalability impact of the Ethereum 2.0 scaling solutions — once implemented, Ethereum’s Plasma and Sharding scalability solutions will deliver hundreds of thousands of transactions.While Ethereum may not currently be able to support widespread adoption in the way Buterin envisages it, the technological foundation upon which the future of Ethereum will be built is being developed at a rapid rate.

The loss of over $40 billion from the cumulative cryptocurrency market cap over the last week hasn’t deterred some of the largest companies in the blockchain industry from looking toward the future, however, with major trading platforms announcing plans to go public.Related: Bitmain Announces Potential Hong Kong IPORumors of IPOs from cryptocurrency platforms such as Binance, Bitmain, and Robinhood have captured the attention of crypto investors and traditional market investors alike over recent months. Cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain hinted toward a Hong Kong-based IPO in June, potentially following in the footsteps of competitor Canaan Creative, who filed for a $1 billion Hong Kong-based IPO in May.Major mining companies may be ready to launch within the traditional stock market, but cryptocurrency exchange platform Binance remains hesitant. Responding to community speculation regarding the recent addition of a new CFO to the Binance executive team, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has officially stated that the exchange has no plans to launch an IPO.#Binance have no plans for IPO, but that doesn't make those experiences less valuable in our new industry. On the contrary, those are very much needed.

In a recent talk at the TechCrunch Disrupt SF event, Robinhood CEO Baiju Bhatt revealed that the stock and cryptocurrency trading platform is preparing to launch an IPO and is currently searching for a qualified CFO that would allow Robinhood to go public later this year.Related: Robinhood on CryptoSlateThe Robinhood platform has already captured $539 million in private investment rounds from investors that include Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Google’s Capital G, boasting a three-tiered monetization stream that capitalizes on the sale of order flow to exchanges, a paid subscription model, and the interest held in Robinhood user accounts.In addition to facilitating cryptocurrency trading, Robinhood also allows users to buy and sell stocks, ETFs, options, and American depositary slips receipts of international companies. Robinhood may not be a crypto-specific trading platform but boasts over 5 million active users of which crypto traders are a significant portion.Bhatt stated at Disrupt SF that the capital generated from the potential IPO will be used to accelerate product expansion, developing Robinhood infrastructure, and expanding the platform’s talent pool.Coinbase CEO Outlines Possibility of Coinbase IPORobinhood isn’t the only crypto exchange considering a public offering. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong discussed the potential of a Coinbase IPO at the TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2018 event, stating that while the exchange platform is self-sustaining and has been profitable for “quite a while,” he’d “never say never” to the possibility that Coinbase may run an IPO.Related: Coinbase Explores Launching a Crypto ETF, Consults With BlackRockArmstrong’s perspective on going public, however, appears to look beyond the current funding and stock trading paradigm. In the future, states Armstrong, any company that has a cap table should have its own token.Charities, open source projects, funds, and even decentralized organizations will possess their own crypto tokens — Coinbase, according to Armstrong, aims to function as the bridge between fiat currency and the future of tokenized companies.A rapid increase in the use of tokens by companies would see Coinbase listing hundreds of tokens within the next few years, states Armstrong, and potentially millions in future. On such a platform, companies would list stock in the form of tokens, with a tokenized cap table replacing the traditional cap table model.Posted In: Bitcoin, Coinbase, San Francisco, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
413,CryptoSlate,A Brave New Browser: Is BAT Coinbase’s Next Add?,David Lee,1536404400.0,"Earlier this week, Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave Software, unveiled the latest stats on his fledgling browser, Brave.Latest @Brave stats: 4M users (MAU), 21K verified channels, 26K publisher accounts.We will step on gas w/ brave-core + BAT on mobile this fall, get past 5M easily by EOY, >= 12M next, adding BAT ad deals to token grants, making good on the promise of @attentiontoken economics.— BrendanEich (@BrendanEich) September 2, 2018The 4 million users Brave has managed to garner is impressive, given its relatively recent launch in January 2016. However, the inventor of Javascript and co-founder of Firefox clearly has loftier goals. Through Brave, Eich plans to not only win a larger market share of browser usage but also kickstart mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.If Brave continues to grow at its predicted rate, and Coinbase ends up listing Brave’s Basic Attention Token (BAT) on its platform, both may soon come true.Gunning for Chrome and BeyondWhat sets Brave apart from its competitors, however, is its unique blend of privacy, ad-blocking and reward system through its cryptocurrency BAT.Chrome has the largest market share. Internet Explorer use has steadily been declining.Brave protects user privacy by automatically blocking all ads, trackers and “fingerprinting” that companies normally use. However, users can control how much data to keep on the browser, which is soon due for an upgrade that will allow it to adopt many of Chrome’s most popular extensions.A secondary effect of blocking unwanted trackers is increased speed and saved money. The Brave browser is up to eight times faster than its competitors Safari and Chrome and estimates that users save up to $276 on mobile data charges by blocking ads and trackers a browser would normally download.While this is good for users, ad blocking traditionally has a negative effect on online companies’ revenue streams, which Brave circumvents with BAT.Your Attention, Your MoneyBrave is also able to solve the dilemma of balancing internet users’ privacy with publishers’ ad-dependent revenue with BAT.Related: BAT-Enabled Brave Browser Hits 10 Million DownloadsUsers can earn BAT simply by using the Brave browser. If a user chooses to turn on ads, they are also rewarded part of the ad revenue in BAT, which they can use to anonymously “tip” their favorite websites, YouTubers or Twitch streamers each month.This exchange provides Brave users with a simple introduction to cryptocurrencies while also creating an avenue for publishers to be paid directly by consumers.A company like Buzzfeed, for example, could benefit from this, as it searches for a non-advertisement revenue model. Other companies in a similar predicament have either adopted paywalls, asked for reader donations or forced users to turn off ad-blockers to read content.Match Made In HeavenOn July 13, Coinbase revealed that BAT was one of the cryptocurrencies it was considering adding to its platform, and many speculators now believe it will be the next coin added.There are several reasons to believe so. For one, BAT is the “only” ECR-20 token accepted on the Apple Store. This is important to Coinbase, as being listed on the App Stores gives Coinbase a huge advantage over its competitors by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible. Not having to jump through extra hurdles for BAT is definitely an advantage compared to other cryptocurrencies in consideration.Another reason to support BAT’s listing on Coinbase is CEO Brian Armstrong’s affinity for the project. Armstrong has mentioned or alluded to BAT multiple times and its real-life utility aligns with the visionary’s goals.Additionally, Coinbase listed BAT in a recent product design talk, further fueling the fire.Coinbase advertising $zrx $bat $mkr on it’s CB wallet product design talk 👀👀👀 pic.twitter.com/0OCSgJZ2CO— Maximilian (@fiege_max) August 23, 2018Not ImpressedDespite Brave’s progress, it has been unsuccessful in winning over everybody. One tweet, in particular, set off a long tense exchange between Eich and Bitcoin fanatic Francis Pouliot.In 2018/19 many projects that raised money in the ICO craze will realize that their visions are unattainable and their models don't work. I'll have utmost respect for the projects that admit their mistake and distribute the remaining money back to their token holders.— Hasu (@hasufl) September 3, 2018Pouliot argued that, while Brave was a good product, BAT was a useless token and should refund token holders. Instead of competing with Google and Bitcoin, he advised Brave to adopt Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.A great idea would be for @brave (and yourself) to be pionneers in the Lightning Network and implement. It might actually what takes Lightning mainstream first. You would be first mover in the greatest tech innovation since Bitcoin itself. Brave would be future proof.— Francis Pouliot ⚡️ (@francispouliot_) September 3, 2018Eich countered with the fact that the Brave browser had previously used Bitcoin, with many problems, and the argument soon escalated to accusations of pump-and-dumps, immoral money printing and name calling.A Growing DivideWhile both sides had some valid points, it seems silly for an argument to devolve to such levels. After all, both Pouliot and Eich are working to build a cryptocurrency-friendly future.However, exchanges like this may soon become the norm as the tribalism in cryptocurrencies continues to grow.Welcome to crypto! Please select your tribe:– Maximalists– Web 3ers– Ethheads– Ripplegang– MulticoinersDon't sit with the Tron Army kids though, they're a bit weird— Ryan Sean Adams (@RyanSAdams) September 6, 2018Perhaps the solution is to let other groups build in peace and let the market decide the ultimate winners.

414,CryptoSlate,RChain Demonstrates Scalable Blockchain With Audio-On-Chain,Jonathan Kim,1536296400.0,"Third-generation smart contract platforms are seeking to improve upon the inefficiencies of derivative blockchains. On Sept. 6, RChain showcased its blockchain at internet-scale through an audio-on-chain demonstration.Immersive Audio on BlockchainThird-generation blockchain cooperative RChain provided a glimpse into a blockchain at internet-scale during its developer conference in Berlin, according to a press release.By running the decentralized application (dApp) RSong, the RChain testnet exhibited high-volume performance at scale. RChain partnered with Immersion Networks, Resonate and Mycelia to demonstrate the ability to store immersive audio on a blockchain.Founded in 2014, Immersion Networks is a research and development firm working toward innovating new technology to improve the human listening experience. In the press release, Paul Hubert, founder of Immersion Networks, said:“You need to hear our immersive platform to understand just how profoundly different the experience is. This platform can be experienced on the standard stereo headphones you already own.”Several competing smart contract platforms still struggle with issues surrounding scalability. Last year, Ethereum’s mainnet became severely congested after CryptoKitties, a decentralized crypto collectibles game, gained popularity among users.Aiming for unlimited scalability, RChain founder Greg Meredith hopes to achieve a blockchain that can support “Visa level transaction speeds and Facebook levels of data.” The platform is further developing a more efficient, categorized cost model for blockchain transaction costs, called “Phlogiston.”Related: How LifeID Will Introduce Self-Sovereign Identity to the Globe While other blockchain operating systems charge users equally for computing and network resources, Phlogiston separates costs by computing, network, storage and memory usage. This revised cost model allows users to pay for their exact usage.RChain also plans to integrate identity-layer solution LifeID into its mainnet to give users control over their digital identity.LifeID will launch on the Ethereum blockchain and RChain testnet but plans to migrate fully to the RChain mainnet in the future. Due to the scalability benefits, LifeID decided to build its long-term infrastructure on RChain’s third-generation smart contract platform with higher transaction speeds and throughput.Through advancements in scalability, affordable transaction costs and security, RChain is well-poised to become a viable third-generation blockchain.

To solve this, Takara’s direct marketplace smart contract will offer Dragonchain users the ability to purchase at an adoption-based price, stabilized on a monthly basis; avoiding the instability of secondary markets.DragonNet (Launch)As the blockchain industry moves beyond its barebones infrastructure, enterprises will demand faster onboarding than ever. To accommodate this push, DragonNet permits businesses to utilize blockchain-based transaction verifications without the significant time and costs associated with building their own mainnets.DragonDen (Beta Launch)Few may call for decentralization more than the social media sector, which has been stung, perhaps infamously, with a recent epidemic of erroneous narratives and misinformation. DragonDen will stand as a cryptocurrency-enabled social media platform that incentivizes and encourages the circulation of reputable and trustworthy media standards.DragonFactor (Q4 2018 Release)DragonFactor’s identity service will seek to provide users with GDPR-compliant decentralized authentication, permitting them to have autonomy over their data and control over who may access it. Third-parties may set conditional criteria for blockchain-based outcomes. For example, only permitting transactions over a certain threshold to be conducted by verified customers.Marketplace (Q4 2018 Beta Release)Dragonchain is taking a step into the burgeoning gig economy with Marketplace, which will allow any user to seek counsel from vetted and certified experts in a range of fields including crypto, marketing, legal, software development and recruiting.Dragonscale (Q1 2019 Release)To foster development industry-wide, Dragonscale will act as an arbitrator and incubator, connecting blockchain projects with investment capital, service providers and other resources needed to ensure the growth of their businesses.DDSS (Q2 2019 Release)As the Dragonchain platform spreads its wings, a Dragon Days of Slumber Score (DDSS) will invariably become an integral aspect of the platform’s operation. Permitting token holders privilege based on their token balance and length of holding, DDSS may see time become a hotspot for manipulation, which is why Dragonchain has doubled down on a more robust time-tracking system.To Dragonchain’s founder and CEO Joe Roets, the products are an offering calculated to turbocharge the growth and adoption of what remains an “early stage” technology. He reflected:“Given the technology is still in its early stages, there is still a lot of potential for people to transform their industry with blockchain. There is a lot of talent and great ideas out there, but also some hesitation towards getting into the space. Our vision for Dragonchain is solving the biggest barriers to blockchain adoption for enterprises and businesses.”Having emerged from the den of development, Dragonchain will unveil the seven new products in full detail at Blockchain Seattle, Sept. 10-11.Posted In: Seattle, Altcoins, Enterprise, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

418,CryptoSlate,VeChain Partners with Chinese Insurance Firm to Create ‘Collaborative Ecosystem’ Using Thor Blockchain,Shaurya Malwa,1535972400.0,"China’s largest insurance conglomerate by total assets handled, the People’s Insurance Company of China (PICC), has partnered with VeChain, blockchain-based information tracking and governance systems company, with the goal of digitally transforming the insurance industry, according to a press release.China’s Blockchain PushRelated: China Bans Crypto Events in Beijing, Blocks 124 Trading PlatformsWhile the Chinese government continues to maintain a strict stance on cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology companies offering disruptive solutions in the space continue to align with Beijing’s long-term plans for the superpower.Blockchain use in China has been limited to financial products and administrative tracking. That said, the distributed systems that will be used to transform the traditional paper-based insurance sector represents another first.A state-owned company, PICC provides insurance from casualty cases to commercial contracts via its three subsidiaries.The insurance industry relies heavily on manual legacy claim management systems to generate paper-based records of individuals or businesses. However, this practice leads to inefficiencies during data collation, verification and auditing processes, leading to an expensive and time-consuming insurance process for all parties involved.VeChain Joins the FrayUnder the terms of the agreement, VeChain’s enterprise blockchain solution will be adopted by PICC to mitigate insurance fraud, inaccurate underwriting and other illegal practices.The insurance giant believes utilizing blockchain technology will bring forth a “digital transformation” of the broader insurance industry by providing quicker processing times, accurate KYC assessments, mitigating fraud and, overall, improving customer experience.PICC further intends to utilize VeChain’s IoT prowess to provide “instant compensation” for affected parties and increasing annual revenues for the former.The blockchain solution is wholly-developed by Shanghai-based VeChain, in partnership with DNV GL, a Nordic organization that offers technical solutions to a broad range of industries–including food and beverage, energy, oil and gas, and maritime.PICC will not educate clients on blockchain technology. However, it will aim to seamlessly integrate a robust blockchain network into its existing infrastructure.VET’s Increasing AllureVeChain previously partnered with DNV GL on a variety of projects across industries–the latter owns a small stake in VeChain after a private deal in May 2018–to propel an exclusive focus on creating blockchain-based governance and business ecosystems.Related: VeChain Thor Mainnet Goes LiveVeChainThor, VeChain’s public blockchain that operates on VET tokens, supports the development of security and government framework, allowing organizations to control assets, information and revenue through a robust distributed system.Sunny Lu, co-founder of VeChain, expressed his thoughts:“Collaborating with PICC expands our business within the insurance industry. We are confident we will provide great service and products to PICC, together with DNV GL.”In terms of a pilot, PICC will initially test VeChain’s solutions for select use-cases before a full-fledged expansion to blockchain systems to ultimately create a “collaborative ecosystem” for clients and even competitors.Posted In: VeChain, China, Adoption, Altcoins, Enterprise, Insurance, KYC, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

With the integration of LINK Chain, Line hopes to introduce its 600 million users to an extensive ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps).Based in Japan, Line developed the LINK Chain as a customized blockchain network designed to directly apply dApps to its messaging platform. LINK Chain produced its first genesis block on Aug. 23.Furthermore, Line plans to build an entire token economy around dApp-related services, rewarding users with LINK tokens for completing tasks in content, commerce, social and gaming.LINK User Reward WorkflowIn the official press release, Line’s CEO Takeshi Idezawa said:“Over the last seven years, Line was able to grow into a global service because of our users, and now with LINK, we wanted to build a user-friendly reward system that gives back to our users. With LINK, we would like to continue developing as a user participation-based platform, one that rewards and shares added value through the introduction of easy-to-use dApps for people’s daily lives.”As the Line ecosystem grows, 1 billion LINK will gradually be issued on the BitBox exchange. Of that, Line will allocate 800 million LINK tokens for user rewards, while the remaining 200 million LINK will be kept for reserve by LINK’s issuer Line Tech Plus.Currently, Japanese residents will not have access to LINK due to pending regulatory authorization. However, Japanese residents will be able to utilize an alternative token, called “LINK Point,” which holds the same functionality as LINK tokens on the Line platform. LINK Point is not eligible for trading on BitBox or any other exchanges.Posted In: Japan, Adoption, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
420,CryptoSlate,How ICON Partnered with Korea’s Biggest Insurance Firm to Develop Blockchain Apps,Joseph Young,1535518800.0,"This past June, ICON, the most valuable blockchain project in South Korea, secured a strategic partnership with Kyobo Life, the country’s largest insurance firm alongside Samsung, to develop blockchain-based services.In 2017, prior to the creation of the newly drafted legislation that will recognize cryptocurrency- and blockchain-related businesses as legitimate, regulated institutions, South Korea’s Ministry of Science & ICT led an initiative to support blockchain development as a part of the fourth industrial revolution.Kyobo Life and ICON’s PartnershipKyobo Life, which was selected to lead a pilot project to create blockchain-based automated insurance claiming services within the initiative, reached out to ICON and its development team to work alongside other regulated financial institutions–including KOFIA and 25 security firms–to develop blockchain applications that can be deployed and commercialized at a large scale.Related: An Introduction to ICON (ICX): The Interconnecting Blockchain NetworkTwo months ago, as a follow up to their previous collaboration, Kyobo Life and ICON established an official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to utilize the blockchain in automating the complex insurance claiming process.Currently, most insurance companies and healthcare centers rely on outdated networks and hardware such as fax machines to allow patients to receive their insurance payment.With a scheduled pilot test in September, Kyobo Life and the ICONLOOP development team are planning to launch a formal operation in October, which will mark the deployment of the first blockchain-based insurance system integrated by one of the largest insurance companies in Asia.In an exclusive interview with CryptoSlate, Jonghyup Kim, Foundation Council Member at ICON Foundation and CEO of ICONLOOP, said:“The partnership signed with Kyobo in 2018 is a follow-up project. As the pilot test received good feedback from the government and the industry, Kyobo and ICONLOOP decided to expand the platform by calling together more participants and further automate the claiming process. With more hospitals and insurance providers on board, ICONLOOP will go through a pilot test by September 2018 and launch a formal operation starting October.”Difficulty in Commercializing Blockchain in the Insurance SectorInsurance policies regarding data storage and settlements vary depending on the country an insurance company operates in. In South Korea, for example, Kim explained that agencies are prohibited from storing insurance data directly, possibly to prevent security breaches and information leaks.Legally, there are many issues that insurance companies have to overcome before attempting to upload personal information on the blockchain, which exists in a peer-to-peer and decentralized environment.Related: South Korea: ICOs and Blockchain Top Priority for Ongoing ‘Extraordinary’ MeetingTo create a blockchain application specifically targeted at insurance companies, the development team will have to design the platform in a way that will remain compliant with local regulations regarding data settlement.Legal hurdles, not necessarily technical issues, have prevented blockchain-based services from being commercialized in the insurance sector, and for the blockchain to be widely adopted in the industry, both companies and regulators will have to put in additional effort to understand and embrace the technology.Given the South Korean government’s initiative to include blockchain as one of the core technologies in the fourth industrial revolution paired with Kyobo Life’s enthusiasm toward the potential of blockchain technology, the ICON-Kyobo partnership could be the first step toward wide commercialization of blockchain in South Korea’ insurance sector.Kim added:“For instance, in a typical insurance transaction process, a printed copy of the insurance policy must be handed in by the insured him/herself. We are trying to automate this process by either delivering the data from the hospital to the insurer through a separate channel and then recording it on the blockchain, or applying smart contract to new products that do not fall under the regulatory compliance yet. We believe our experiments, by showcasing the true potential of blockchain, can educate corporates, regulators and the public and make a positive impact on regulatory framework in the end.”Most recently, ICON was selected by the Korea Ministry of Science & ICT to participate in the “Cultivating Innovative Youth Talents 2018” program, which was designed to help 4,500 youth talents specialize in the fourth industrial revolution and core technologies within it, such as blockchain.Posted In: Korea, Adoption, Altcoins, Insurance     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
421,CryptoSlate,BAT-Enabled Brave Browser Hits 10 Million Downloads,Shaurya Malwa,1535432400.0,"Brave Software has revealed that its cryptocurrency-backed browser, Brave, has surpassed 10 million downloads.Earlier this year, in May, the browser reached 5 million downloads, increasing five-fold since January.Thrilled that Brave for @Android now has over 10 million downloads! 😍 Thank you to our users for choosing to browse faster and safer, and for valuing privacy protection! https://t.co/ME6ZkOYfLx pic.twitter.com/nBmpMFEcBa— Brave Software (@brave) August 24, 2018Brave Shows How Blockchain is DoneThe cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to grapple with lack of regulation, scams, frauds and the absence of working products to justify a $225 billion market cap. However, companies like Brave, which launched without much ado or flashy promotions, prove that cryptocurrency products can integrate with ease into existing user habits, and perhaps even triumph over competitors.In comparison to other enterprising, and often far-fetched, blockchain projects, the Brave browser had a relatively smoother path to mainstream adoption.The flagship browser offers an inbuilt app blocker that speeds up a user’s browsing experience, provides greater security and consumes lesser data. However, Brave’s USP lies in its related Basic Attention Token (BAT), which incentivizes users to view advertisements and award content creators.The BAT TokenOffered via an ICO in May 2017, BAT famously raised over $35 million within 30 seconds of sale commencement. At the time, the Ethereum-based token promised investors a decentralized advertisement solution, a narrative which has undoubtedly succeeded.Related: Five Blockchain Businesses Appear on WSJ ‘2018 Tech Companies to Watch’ ListRegarding incentives, users are rewarded BAT merely by browsing the internet, with all tokens received through an inbuilt app wallet. While users can utilize collected tokens for tipping creators and publishers, the latter can enable Brave-supported advertisements on their platform to earn additional revenue, which the company touts is larger than YouTube payouts.Advertisers can also purchase BAT on cryptocurrency exchanges to buy ad slots on the Brave browser. However, precise statistics on the number of marketing firms choosing brave over Google, YouTube or other social media platforms remain unknown as of writing.Increasing UtilityAs per the whitepaper, future partnerships may allow BAT-enabled purchases on several different platforms in exchange for services or goods. For now, however, the token’s utility is limited to altcoin traders and ad-slot purchasing.Despite its recent success, Brave is quick to point out that the download number does not necessarily correspond to a compared amount of users. In July, the company stated that it had 3 million active users per day, with the figure expected to hit 5 million by the end of 2018.Today, Brave is compatible across several operating systems–including Linux, Windows and Apple–and features over 20 search engines.

422,CryptoSlate,OmiseGO Announces Release of OMG Network Repo and Tesuji Plasma Progress,Sam Town,1535364000.0,"Ethereum-based payment platform OmiseGO announced a major step forward in the quest for DLT scalability, releasing an early alpha of a Plasma-based scaling solution that may potentially increase the transaction capacity of the OMG network.Announced via a Medium post, the GitHub repository published by the OmiseGO team provides an insight into OmiseGO’s Tesuji milestone. Tesuji, which integrates plasma scaling solutions, is essentially the first release of the OMG network solution that aims to dramatically improve the number of financial services available to the underbanked and function as a lightning-fast payments processing blockchain.Repo for Tesuji #Plasma, basis of the first release of the #OMG Network, is now #opensource.https://t.co/qTuchpQ7Dk— OmiseGO (@omise_go) August 24, 2018Tesuji Plasma Repo ReleasedThe OmiseGO team states that while the Tesuji Plasma solution is still under active development and is not yet ready for release on a public testnet, those who are interested can download a child chain server and watcher software that monitors the behavior of the Plasma chain and root chain in order to “play with it.”OmiseGO’s implementation of the Plasma scaling solution is based on Vitalik Buterin, Joseph Poon, and David Knott’s “Minimum Viable Plasma” design, and has been constructed with the implementation of the More Viable Plasma solution in mind.The launch of the Tesuji OMG Network and integration with the eWallet will allow for the creation of Ethereum-based tokens as well as their transfer and management between all eWallets and users. The initial iteration of the Tesuji OMG Network, states the OmiseGO team, will use the Proof of Authority consensus model with OmiseGO functioning as the validator until the development of Plasma matures and work toward a Proof of Stake model continues.What is Plasma?Related Story: Vitalik Buterin: Sharding and Plasma to Help Ethereum Reach 1 Million Transactions Per SecondCreated primarily by Lightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Plasma is essentially built on top of blockchains. Plasma functions as a series of smart contracts that run on top of a root chain — in this case, the Ethereum chain.The OMG Tesuji implementation of Plasma can be architecturally likened to the structure of a tree — the core chain as the trunk and root, while child plasma chains are akin to branches. The potential the Plasma solution holds for solving the scalability problem is massive — the Plasma white paper posits that implementation could result in the creation of a blockchain that could execute billions of state updates per second.Tesuji Plasma Internal Testnet Already LiveThe benefits of Plasma to OmiseGO — who are planning to create a massive payment platform to rival Visa — are obvious. Tesuji Plasma is designed to deliver faster, cheaper transactions while retaining security, providing native support to ETH and ERC20 tokens.OmiseGO states that Tesuji Plasma is currently running on an internal testnet, which will be moved to a public testnet once the development team considers it safe and responsible to do so.Posted In: Ethereum, Thailand, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
423,CryptoSlate,Inside OnChainFX’s Breakeven Multiple and the Winners of Last Alt Season,David Lee,1535173200.0,"While 2017 was a year of exorbitant gains and lavish dreams, 2018 has crashed the reality of cryptocurrency enthusiasts back to Earth. Many of the incredible gains seen in 2017 have been entirely wiped out, and those who bought at or near all-time-highs (ATH) are deep in the red.To help illustrate those losses, OnChainFX recently added a Breakeven Multiple to its cryptocurrency metrics display. Of the 107 cryptocurrencies listed, the range they had to “x” to break even varied from 1.1x to 39.6x.The top 10 cryptocurrencies with the greatest loss from ATH.The reason for such a large spectrum can be explained by the exponential relationship between percent loss and the breakeven multiple. For example, a 40 percent or 50 percent loss requires a cryptocurrency to 1.66x or 2x to break even, respectively, and an 80 percent or 90 percent loss must multiply by a factor of 5 or 10.As the percent loss increases, the factor a cryptocurrency must multiply by to break even greatly increases.To help demonstrate this further, imagine you started with an original investment of $100. If you incurred a 50 percent loss, your investment, now worth $50, would have to double to break even at $100. At the further end of the spectrum, a 90 percent loss would require your $10 investment to multiply by a factor of 10, and a 95 percent loss would require your remaining $5 to multiply by a factor of 20.While a starting price of $100 is much easier to stomach, many people have suffered losses of far greater consequence. A recent New York Times article shared the experience of one English man, whose $23,000 investment shrank to $4,000. Another investor, a Korean teacher, lost 90 percent of the $90,000 she invested after drawing on her savings, an insurance policy and a $25,000 loan.Although these losses are certainly devastating, the gains of 2017 still offer a sliver of hope.In 2017, Bitcoin and Ethereum rose by more than 1,500 percent and 10,000 percent, respectively. The year also included a period of explosive growth in altcoins, dubbed “Alt Season,” which even out-performed Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s gains.The top five performers of 2017’s alt-season were Verge (XVG), Nano (NANO), Neo (NEO), Ripple (XRP) and NEM (XEM). For example:Verge started the year at $0.0019 and finished at $0.2226, a 1,171,479 percent gain or an 11,714x.Nano started the year at $0.0097 and finished at $21.26, a 219,072 percent gain or a 2190x.NEO started the year at $0.145 and finished at $75.96, a 52,372 percent gain or a 523x.Ripple started the year at $0.0064 and finished at $2.30, a 35,781 percent gain or a 357x.NEM started the year at $0.003676 and finished at $1.03, a 27,747 percent gain or a 277x.Given these numbers, it’s certainly possible for cryptocurrencies to do the required “x” to breakeven or create new ATHs. However, there are a few reasons to be pessimistic about the probability of such an outcome occurring.One reason to bet against some cryptocurrencies never recovering their ATHs is new regulations in the cryptocurrency space. Last year was the year of ICOs, with millions of dollars pouring into any project with any resemblance of a white paper. Unfortunately, almost none of those companies have delivered their promised project, and in response, regulatory agencies have clamped down on the ICO model.Market cap of cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin. In November, the total market cap was less than $100 billion. Following “alt season,” the market cap peaked at $543 billion in early January. (coinmarketcap.com)The second reason to be wary of the recovery is due to the change in the mindset of investors. When 2017’s alt season took off, investors rushed to claim their part of the digital gold rush. Although people were advised to DYOR (“Do Your Own Research”) and only invest whatever they were prepared to lose, the exorbitant gains investors saw others making encouraged them to follow blindly.When looking at projects that pumped, there appears to be no rhyme or reason–where pretty much any investment put into any project returned considerable gains. Now that we’re deep in a bear market, investors will be much warier of simply FOMOing (Fear of Missing Out) into cryptocurrencies and new investors will proceed with greater caution. Because of this, many of the less credible projects will likely head toward zero.The last argument against full ATH recovery is a combination of the previous two reasons as well as the maturation of the market.Now that companies aren’t cloaked by mind-boggling gains and a misleading market cap, investors can evaluate their true worth. Of the thousands of existing cryptocurrency projects, which ones will actually deliver their proposed product? Of those, how many are actually worth their supposed market cap?At its peak, Ripple’s market cap was valued at $128 billion. Even if Ripple can do everything it is purported to do, is it worth that or beyond? Returning to its ATH would put Ripple in the ranks of top 100 companies like IBM, Nike and McDonald’s.The 53-65 biggest companies in the world. Nike is valued at $110 billion. (statista.com)Although you can never truly know when it comes to the unpredictable and volatile cryptocurrency market, it appears likely that a good portion of cryptocurrencies will never recover their ATHs given the aforementioned reasons. Although bad for their investors, the upside is that that money will funnel into the more legitimate projects and Bitcoin, and eventually, the true value of each project will be revealed.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

425,CryptoSlate,"Dash User Launches Vote to Demote CEO Ryan Taylor, Company Burning $500K Per Month",Jonnie Emsley,1535014800.0,"After a referendum was launched to demote Dash CEO Ryan Taylor due to missed deadlines, one disgruntled Dash community member put the privacy coin’s decentralized governance model to the test.Submitted Aug. 6 by user SavingPrivateDash, the proposal suggests that Taylor should be bumped down to an advisory role and that human resources should appoint a new CEO.As a network governed in a decentralized fashion, Dash designates the power of voting solely to masternodes. For the cost of 5 Dash ($681), any user may propose changes and initiate a vote, which is what was done by the pseudonymous SavingPrivateDash.The network appears to have confidence in Taylor’s leadership abilities, however. At the time of writing, 830 masternodes voted against the motion and 95 in favor. For Taylor to get the boot, 1218 additional “Yes” votes are required by Aug. 28.What’s This All About?The proposal wields an arsenal of reasons for Taylor’s supposed incompetence, but the chief accusation seems to be that the executive’s mismanagement of funds and failure to develop the project, which resulted in the coin’s dwindling value.Down over 91 percent from its January all-time-high of $1,561, Dash has been one of the bigger losers of the top-25 by market capitalization. The entire market’s unrelenting downturn may be unremarkable, but SavingPrivateDash is pointing the finger at Taylor.The proposal states:“Ryan destroyed the market’s confidence in Dash by repeatedly breaking promises and missing deadlines. Dash was once valued at 0.09BTC and it is now 0.02, in spite of millions of dollars available to him. Vault accounts, usernames, friends lists, easy to use mobile wallets, marketplace. None of the 2016 promises were kept.”SavingPrivateDash, who claims to be a masternode operator, lists various unfulfilled promises and “mistakes” presumably made by Taylor. On the development front, the user seems mainly concerned by the apparent lack of progress on Evolution, Dash’s new decentralized payment platform.The document’s author appears equally scornful of Bradley Zastrow and Fernando Gutierrez, Dash’s head of business development and chief marketing officer, respectively.Describing Zastrow’s abilities with unrestrained derision, the proposal notes:“If Bradley were a community project he would have been defunded after just two months. He is allowed to underperform and underdeliver without consequences, in spite of the disproportional salary he receives.”Should the current plan fail to reach a quorum, SavingPrivateDash stated it would be followed-up with subsequent bids to “fire” Fernando, Bradley and, once more, Taylor.A number of points are untrue or unverifiable until proven otherwise; but intriguingly, SavingPrivateDash does not appear open to the discussion through the usual online channels, explaining:“I do not have any other alias and I do not post on Reddit, Dash Forum or Discord, because Dash communities are not welcoming to criticism.”Regardless of its outcome, the proposal may be celebrated as a triumph of the project’s decentralized governance; a system granting liberties not always readily offered.Posted In: Dash, Altcoins, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
426,CryptoSlate,"While Bitmain Faces Investor Flak, BitMEX Rents Out World’s Most Expensive Office",Shaurya Malwa,1535022000.0,"Two prominent, China-based cryptocurrency businesses are undergoing contrasting fortunes; while Bitmain is facing flak for several inconsistencies in its investor deck and competition from mining rivals, the Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) just moved into the world’s most expensive office.Bitmain’s Falling FortunesBitmain’s rise to the top has been nothing short of spectacular as well as controversial for its deep-seated ideologies favoring Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The company generated over $2 billion in revenue for the first half of 2018, with TechCrunch estimating a $10 billion revenue at year-end (keeping in mind its upcoming IPO).However, the IPO has raised several eyebrows lately–courtesy of Bitmain’s BCH stockpile, declining revenues from Bitcoin mining and, most recently, top investors denying their rumored involvement in the mining giant’s last funding round.Apart from the aforementioned, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. believe Bitmain’s woes run deeper than a stash of BCH, considering the company’s once-mighty technology advantage redundant.An analyst team, led by Mark Li, believes Bitmain must necessarily write down its inventory–in short, devaluing the company–to catch up with rival mining equipment makers, according to the South China Morning Post.The company’s sole mining chip provider, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, should additionally ask for upfront payments from Bitmain and avoid creating the production capacity to suit its demand, noted the analysts’ report, adding “the competitiveness of Bitmain’s chips is in question.”The above was with regard to Bitmain’s failed 10nm chip and BCH holdings, which the analysts valued at over $890 million as of Q1 2018 and has depreciated almost 40 percent since then.Bitmain a One-Off Success?Bernstein acknowledged Bitmain’s performance last year as a “wild success,” noting its impressive 85 percent market dominance of the crypto-mining sector. However, it has since lost market share to Canaan Creative and Ebang International, two mining rig manufacturers also pursuing IPOs in Hong Kong.Additionally, this year’s extended bear market has spilled over to the profits of cryptocurrency-related businesses, compelling mining firms to cut down their reliance on mining revenue and explore other tech avenues.Related: Bitmain IPO: Is the Unicorn Mining Giant Misleading Investors?The focus on Bitmain’s finances has intensified, leading industry observers to investigate finer details of its business. In this regard, local outlets in China reported that two rumored investors in Bitmain–Tencent, and Softbank–categorically denied their involvement in the mining giant’s upcoming IPO.Meanwhile, the downturn of Bitmain is in stark contrast to another China-based cryptocurrency business: BitMEX.Rising Fortunes in Bear MarketFounded by ex-Citibank trader Arthur Hayes, BitMEX has stealthily become one of the world’s most liquid cryptocurrency exchanges, with daily traded volume for Aug. 22 crossing $3.2 billion as per data collated by CoinMarketCap.Despite the bear market, the exchange has created deep pockets for itself in 2018, including enough to rent a floor for its office at one of the world’s most expensive offices in Hong Kong.Related: BTC Spikes to $6800, BitMEX Down for MaintenanceThe 45th floor of the Cheung Kong Center in Hong Kong has been officially leased by BitMEX, according to The Star. The building houses several prominent finance businesses such as Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg, and Bank of America, as well as real estate billionaire Li Ka-Shing’s offices.The development comes amid a price slump in the cryptocurrency market, leading observers to question the industry’s sustainability. In addition, the move signifies how cryptocurrency-related businesses can prosper in the absence of a surging digital asset market.According to additional reports, rents in BitMEX’s new office building are a record $28 (225 Hong Kong dollars) per square foot. The firm leased more than 20,000 sq. ft, or $560,000 per month in rent.Posted In: BitMEX, China, Altcoins, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

428,CryptoSlate,The Ethereum-Dogecoin Transactional Bridge Protocol is Coming Soon,Shaurya Malwa,1534935600.0,"Dogecoin’s much-awaited bridge to the Ethereum blockchain will soon be released following a 13-month long development period, according to the Medium blog. The update will make moving DOGE to the Ethereum network possible and in a seamless manner.ETH-DOGE Join HandsTaking inspiration from Ismael Bejarano and Oscar Guindzberg’s innovative Superblocks protocol, which merges transactional hashes from a Merkle tree into a single block, the update cuts down on unnecessary storage costs by working on a range of blocks instead of storing individual headers.Interested developers can access the open-source user guide for Dogethereum on GitHub; however, Guindzberg notes a few features remain missing and could show up as bugs on test frames. The developer also cautions developers from using coins they hold sentimental value in, saying “use the bridge with coins you are open to losing [sic].”A live demo of the bridge will be live-streamed Sept. 5, at 17H G.M.T by the Dogetheruem team.The Dogecoin MysteryMeanwhile, the Dogethereum protocol continues to be shrouded in mystery. Earlier in 2018, Bejarano and Guindzberg announced they would hard fork Dogecoin and create the DOGX token; however, a code review indicates the Dogecoin-Ethereum bridge is wholly unrelated to that project.At the time, members of the Dogecoin community called out the possible overlap in Dogethereum:“There is an ERC20 token going by the name ‘DOGX’ and calling itself Dogethereum. That project has no association with dogecoin or this dogethereum project. Especially important is that there is no fork of the dogecoin blockchain. Someone made a new ETH token and called it Dogethereum.”A Reddit user in the same thread replied that DOGX was not an ERC20 token and unrelated to the Doge-Ethereum bridge project. Instead, the former was a mere copy-cat of the Ethereum blockchain to Dogethereum.Furthermore, TrueBit, a scalable protocol for blockchains, launched a native “penetrable public art space,” called the Dogethereum Bridge Art Project, and is said to be launching its own version of the protocol. The project attempts to be a “physical representation” of Dogethereum, with contest winner Jessica Angel adding she was inspired by the Mobius Bridge in England.The aforementioned artwork is a collaborative effort between Truebit and Bajerano’s company CoinFabrik, indicating the two rumoredly different projects indeed have operational similarities.Posted In: Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
429,CryptoSlate,Research: Bitcoin Cash Declining in Adoption and Merchant Use Cases,Shaurya Malwa,1534899600.0,"Blockchain analysis and forensics firm Chainalysis recently produced a report on payments received by the world’s top 17 cryptocurrency merchants, concluding the role of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has steadily decreased in most day-to-day transactions.As reported by Bloomberg, a group of researchers from Chainalysis observed a stark decline in BCH transactions in 2018. While payments soared at $10.5 million in March 2018, the number dropped to a mere $3.7 million two months later.BCH data was collated from merchants including BitPay, Coinify and GoCoin, three of the largest crypto-payment providers.In comparison, Bitcoin recorded figures of $60 million in the same month but was similarly down from a $412 million high in 2017.Regarding price action, BCH declined by over 75 percent from its all-time high, while BTC fared comparatively better with a 55 percent plunge. Additionally, BCH remains the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap; however, it forms only 10 percent of the total BTC cap.Kim Grauer, a senior economist at Chainalysis, noted the number of holders and users of BCH was steadily declining. Grauer also highlighted that “concentration ownership” led to BCH’s eventual loss of favor, presumably referring to the loyal, but small, set of supporters the controversial Bitcoin hard fork enjoys.She added that only 67 BCH wallets hold over 56 percent of the currency, which is not seen on any prominent crypto-exchange.The economist estimates between 10,000 and 100,000 BCH are held by two wallet addresses, adding that only the most BCH-wealthy holders “send a lot of traffic to merchant services.”Meanwhile, BCH proponent Roger Ver has remained undeterred. He pointed out the benefits of BCH transactions in a tweet, Aug. 13:The long term price of a crypto currency is a function of its usefulness as a currency. pic.twitter.com/0LjX3fBrQb— Roger Ver (@rogerkver) August 13, 2018   Bitcoin Cash 7 Nov at 2:54 am UTC$437.58  -3.46%Bitcoin Cash, currently ranked #4 by market cap, is down 3.46% over the past 24 hours.

430,CryptoSlate,The Case for Stablecoins: A Much-Needed Asset Class or the Worst Crypto Idea?,Shaurya Malwa,1534896000.0,"The case of cryptocurrencies’ global relevance remains a moot point given its wildly volatile nature, an aspect which has spurred a billion dollar crypto-exchange market.However, some entrepreneurs and companies are determined to bring needful price stability to the digital asset market.Crypto-Trading Market Creating Huge VolatilityCryptocurrencies are arguably the world’s most exciting high-risk, high-reward investment class, with billions of coins exchanging hands each day. At its peak, the crypto market was $200 billion short of the magnificent $1 trillion mark; however, it has since plunged to a $205 billion total market cap after the price frenzy was corrected in 2018.Away from frantic Bitcoin swap trading, high-leverage investments and ETF hopefuls, a group of businesses are pivoted on creating a “stablecoin,” or a cryptocurrency that does not fluctuate in monetary value.Related: The Importance of Stablecoins in the Supply ChainFrom an economic perspective, maintaining a stable monetary value for a decentralized, limited supply cryptocurrency is seemingly impossible; demand and supply metrics ensure prices keep increasing or decreasing, which is the case with a majority of the 1,800-plus cryptocurrencies in the world today–traded on just close to 200 exchanges.To prevent this, stablecoin projects peg their digital tokens to a fiat currency–such as the U.S. dollar, British pound or Japanese yen–or are based on an underlying real-world asset like gold. Doing so ensures an inherent lack of volatility and increased confidence.Stablecoins: The Bad and The BackedMost controversial in this regard is Hong Kong-based Tether, which is partly owned by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and claims to have over $2.7 billion backing its tokens. The outrageous claim has been subject to several public interest lawsuits and third-party audits, with each claim remaining undisputed to date.Inspired by Tether’s dominance, or rather its lack of trust, prominent companies like Circle are developing native stablecoins. In fact, the crypto-finance company is set to launch a “USD Coin” in the near future.Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire explained the token concept to BBC, stating:“Imagine a U.S. dollar coin that you can make payments with, use on crypto networks or use in smart contracts to pay dividends, but which you can convert back to fiat currency at any time.”The USD coin is based on the Ethereum blockchain and Circle has set up internal regulatory standards, called “Center,” to overlook the protocol. The company has also highlighted Center as an integral part of its long-term vision and aims to build it as the leading platform for other stablecoin projects.Developing a New Financial SystemAllaire added that cryptocurrencies are the “next layer of infrastructure” of the internet, enabling speed-of-light monetary transfers around the world and binding, verifiable contracts for trustless peer-to-peer businesses.Related Article: Circle Raises $110M to Create ‘USDC’ Ethereum-Compatible StablecoinCircle is backed by big-name banks looking to enter the cryptocurrency market. For example, it raised $3 billion from Goldman Sachs and Baidu in 2017. Most recently, mining giant Bitmain led a $110 million investment round in the firm.A comparable venture is Vancouver-based Stably, founded by Kory Hoang in 2017. The company is currently developing the “Stable USD” on the Ethereum blockchain, with Hoang calling the stablecoin market a “huge opportunity.”He added:“Fruit sellers on the streets in Zimbabwe could accept your digital payment via an app. Their fiat money is almost worthless, but they could receive tokens in seconds and sell them very easily for a small commission.”However, some cryptocurrency executives remain divided over the best method of achieving price stability for digital assets.Liquidity Equals Non-VolatilityLondon-based Coinfloor believes the market must attract far more money to ensure higher liquidity and large trading volumes, which subsequently leads to less volatility.Coinfloor Director Obi Nwosu maintains that robust regulations will attract institutional money into the market, indicating stablecoins may not be needed if liquidity is adequate. However, he also notes widespread concerns about money laundering and terrorist financing must mitigate before the aforementioned is possible.Stablecoin outfits require centralized bodies to control their supply and back their tokens, which ultimately leads to a market conflicting with the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, according to Nwosu.The entrepreneur considers stablecoins as the “worse of both worlds,” referring to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.Tokenize it All?Instead, Nwosu advocates the tokenization of real-world assets such as real estate and precious metal, courtesy of smart contracts governing legality, ownership and price action.Echoing his thoughts, Akbar Thobani of SFOX said:“We think that tokenizing assets, such as trucks, cars, planes and real estate, will become big business.”While the fight for solving scaling issues, price volatility and ease-of-payments prevails in the cryptocurrency space, only time will decide what direction the market takes–favoring Goldman Sachs-backed ideologies or Nakamoto’s free-market solution.Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, Analysis, Stablecoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

After purchase, the platform provided tools for the cryptocurrencies to be traded with no withdrawals.eToro also recently added deposits and real trading of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, and Stellar Lumens. This is huge, as prior to the change profits could only be realized in fiat currencies, not crypto.While eToro is not currently available for U.S. users, there is a waitlist for users to register in advance.eToro continues to make major moves improving its position as a top cryptocurrency business. While it’s not clear if these teams plan to hold onto the received Bitcoin, this partnership is a fantastic step for the worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency.Posted In: Bitcoin, Israel, Adoption, Altcoins, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Ethereum, NEO and Stellar, meanwhile, have remained in their same positions; however, Bitcoin has risen to No. 10, compared to its No. 16 ranking in July. Beyond the top 10, Cardano’s No. 14 ranking came as a surprise, despite its status as the second biggest proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network in market valuation.As for the No. 1 position, EOS’ high ranking is based on its advanced PoS consensus algorithm.Furthermore, smart contract protocols and blockchain networks designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) have been shown to rank higher in the CCID rankings due to the technology and application scoring categories. However, this doesn’t explain Bitcoin’s uptick, as there have been no foundation or monumental changes in Bitcoin network.It remains unknown what prompts the changes in the rankings of these blockchain projects, as the past four months haven’t shown any trackable trends, and consumers should use caution when using these rankings as metrics for buying or trading cryptocurrencies.The CCID includes contributions of researchers and professors from China’s most prestigious educational institutions.Posted In: China, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

434,CryptoSlate,Asia Head of BitConnect Arrested at Delhi Airport,Sam Town,1534730400.0,"Divyesh Darji, the alleged Asian head of defunct cryptocurrency platform BitConnect, was arrested by Indian authorities at Delhi Airport on August 18. The arrest is set to provide a modicum of justice to those affected by what has been dubbed the biggest scam in cryptocurrency history.Local news media reports Darji was arrested after his arrival at Delhi Airport from Dubai, identifying Darji as the Asia head of the BitConnect platform, which is registered in the UK and operated from the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai.BitConnect Saga ContinuesThe arrest is the latest event in the ongoing BitConnect saga, which began with a December 2016 initial coin offering that saw the value of BCC, the platform’s native token, surge to an all-time high market cap of $2.6 billion in January 2018.Related Story: The Taller They Stand, The Harder They Fall: The Collapse of BitConnectBCC values plummeted to zero in late January, however, after a series of cease and desist orders from regulatory bodies and an announcement form BitConnect that the platform was shutting down revealed the platform to be fraudulent in nature.Darji was one of the most outspoken promoters of BitConnect both within India in abroad and has been linked to a series of scandals involving prominent Indian ex-members of parliament and the extortion of 2,000 BTC from BitConnect investors.In statements released to the Times of India, Indian State Police Director General Ashish Bhatia announced that Darji’s arrest was executed based on an existing lookout notice that resulted in the BitConnect representative being brought to Gandhinagar on Saturday.The BitConnect platform achieved significant penetration in Indian financial markets subsequent to Reserve Bank of India demonetization action that saw the elimination of ₹500 and ₹1000 notes of the Mahatma Gandhi series, resulting in a loss of public faith in fiat currency in late 2016 and an increased interest in cryptocurrency platforms.Bhatia noted in statements that BitConnect held an office in Surat, India, and “lured” investors with promises of up to 60 percent return on interest on a monthly basis. In addition to Bhatia’s announcement of arrest a statement from the Indian CID state that 169 Bitcoin and 8kg of gold were captured as a result of an investigation into the BitConnect case.Indian Authorities Pursue BitConnect LeadersDetails released to Financial Express by inspector P G Narwade of Criminal Investigation Department of Gujarat police reveal that Darji’s arrest is the result of the third case currently being investigated by the Indian CID in relation to the BitConnect scam.Indian law enforcement activities related to BitConnect includes the arrest of Surat-based builder and BitConnect investor Shailesh Bhat, who kidnapped employees of BitConnect promoter Satish Kumbhani and extorted thousands of Bitcoin at gunpoint.The final exchange trading BitConnect tokens — TradeSatoshi — announced on August 10 that it will delist BCC on September 10, heralding the official, final death of the BitConnect token and adding it to the long list of “deadcoins”.The following coins will be delisted from Tradesatoshi Exchange the 10-09-18BCC, LBC, EBLU, SLC, BSS, FRX, HYPER, DMCC, JESUS, TPAY. pic.twitter.com/6jEn8N8y8K— Trade Satoshi (@TradeSatoshi) August 10, 2018Posted In: Altcoins, Scams     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
435,CryptoSlate,Venezuela: Petro Cryptocurrency Becomes National Unit-of-Account,Shaurya Malwa,1534496400.0,"The cryptocurrency situation in Venezuela received a push on Tuesday, Aug. 14, after President Nicolás Maduro announced that the state-issued Petro token is legally a unit-of-account in the crisis-stricken country, ABC International reports.Maduro’s Giant Cryptocurrency ExperimentLaunched in February 2018, the oil-backed cryptocurrency Petro was developed by the Venezuelan government to evade U.S. and European economic sanctions amid the deepening political crisis.After launch, the controversial token was offered to several countries as an option for purchasing Venezuela oil at a discount, a move which all parties understandably denied.Now, the country is pegging the Petro as a monetary unit and even aims to pay salaries and provide pensions with the cryptocurrency.First announced on a televised interview with a state-run news channel, Maduro stated national oil company PDVSA will begin to use Petro as an “official” unit-of-account. In addition, Venezuelans will be introduced to a new salary system that partly incentivizes talent with cryptocurrencies, alongside changing the tariffs for several products linked to the Petro.Maduro told viewers:“As of next Monday, Venezuela will have a second accounting unit based on the price, the value of the Petro. It will be a second accounting unit of the Republic and will begin operations as a mandatory accounting unit of our PDVSA oil industry.”Making Economic InroadsThe president believes Petro could mark a “substantial improvement” in Venezuela economic woes, although the reasons for this proclamation are not readily clear. Maduro also promised better wages and the reappearing of the “maximum retail price” system, the disappearance of which caused the Venezuelan crisis in the first place.As it stands, Venezuela will now have two distinct state-owned currencies–the sovereign bolivar and the cryptocurrency Petro–after Aug. 20.Attempting to evade the crisis, Maduro noted that five zeros would be “taken away” from the bolivar to bring stability to the region and a hopeful monetary conversion in the future. The country’s private and national banks have already received the new banknotes, the president added.As per reports, the Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) will peg the bolivar to Petro prices, the latter of which shall be determined by international currencies. The step marks the world’s first instance of a national currency pegged to a cryptocurrency.At the time of ICO, Petro was marketed with 82.4 million units of its tokens and raised $734 million on the first day of pre-sale. The cryptocurrency was introduced after the prices of goods rose multifold and inflation touched a staggering 1,000,000 percent in 2018.Petro’s Supposed BenefitsDespite Petro’s controversial beginnings, the currency does hold relevance to Venezuela’s economic crisis if Maduro and his government proceed truthfully.The Petro whitepaper claims to be fully compliant with Venezuelan legislation, despite the country’s opposite claiming the contrary.Furthermore, citizens using Petro will be liable to pay 10 percent less tax than their fiat-welding peers, and the discounted prices are said to propagate into other payment systems in the future.Venezuela is also set to be benefitted from export trade as the Petro is easily converted into U.S. dollars and the bolivar. Although this point raises additional concerns about money laundering if transactions are entirely conducted in cash.It remains to be seen if this experiment marks the advent of using cryptocurrencies in an administrative framework or adds to the list of criticisms the burgeoning asset class faces.Posted In: Venezuela, Adoption, Altcoins, Regulation     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
436,CryptoSlate,Report: Fraudulent Monero Mining Generates $100K Per Month for Hackers,Shaurya Malwa,1534467600.0,"A German university released a cryptocurrency mining-centric report, Aug. 14, noting a rise in revenue generated by illegal mining software, despite the fall in “cryptojacking.”Coinhive Faces the Heat AgainAs reported by Digital Trends, RWTH University in Aachen, Germany, has presented a detailed account of the infamous, browser-based miner Coinhive being used to produce over $250,000 worth of Monero (XMR) per month for attackers, as per trading value denoted by CryptoSlate at the time of writing.Developed to be a social good, the Coinhive miner was initially introduced to crypto-enthusiasts to allow them to exchange their extra computing power for access to mine the Monero network. The code, however, targets websites seeking to make money without advertisements, meaning a user’s computer will slow down while it generates coins in exchange for ad-free viewing.Hackers, meanwhile, have configured Coinhive to send a user’s mined Monero to their own digital wallets by hacking websites and secretly installing the code. They are also plugging Coinhive into legitimate-appearing browser extensions.Interestingly, the Coinhive miner accounts for 1.8 percent of Monero’s hashing power, with a majority of mining incentives realized for nefarious purposes.The report noted:“If we sum up the block rewards of the actually mined blocks over the observation period of four weeks, we find that Coinhive earned 1,271 XMR.”At the time of writing, Monero is trading at $89.28, signifying a $113,474 profit for hackers in a month of fraudulent mining. Meanwhile, Coinhive developers receive over 30 percent of this amount for providing their tools.Only 10 Addresses Getting RichThe research also claims that only 10 wallet addresses received a chunk of the fraudulently mined Monero. In this regard, attackers are using a “short link” service to redirect advertisements to their servers and paying a commission to website administrators.The report explained:“With Coinhive, the creator of the short link receives a share of the block reward that is mined by the users visiting the short links.”For research purposes, the university team ran a “WebAssembly” script to detect web-based mining software running on the internet. Scan results showed a clear dominance of Coinhive, which accounted for 75 percent of mining usage. Comparable scans include AuthedMine, WP Monero Miner and CryptoLoot.The JavaScript-based Coinhive proves to be an easy target for hackers around the world due to its choice of programming language, and attackers have deployed the open-source mining software to a diverse range of victims–including government websites, corporations and even the San Diego Zoo.

438,CryptoSlate,Decentralized Exchange AirSwap Launches OTC Trading,Jonathan Kim,1534291200.0,"Built on Ethereum, AirSwap is one of the first decentralized exchanges to gain public adoption as a peer-to-peer value transfer network. On Aug. 15, AirSwap is revealing a new OTC trading product for mainnet rollout.AirSwap Introduces Conversational OTC TradingFounded in 2017, AirSwap became a leader in decentralized exchanges (DEX) by offering frictionless peer-to-peer trades for over 60 ERC20 tokens to a network of retail investors. The company’s board of advisors includes Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin.In a blog post released Aug. 10, AirSwap announced a set of updates to its Widget, Toolkit and over-the-counter trading product. Among the new features is a private chat for traders to negotiate transaction terms and an identification interface designed in partnership with Wyre.The incoming AirSwap OTC block trading product could enable investors with deeper pockets to trade virtually any quantity of digital assets on the decentralized exchange. Don Mosites, co-founder of AirSwap, explained:“It essentially allows you more flexibility on price and the ability to know your counterparty, assess with whom you’d like to do business more directly. With the OTC tools, this unlocks a totally new world of liquidity. This is going to enable trades of any size to happen with the AirSwap network.”With the rise of institutional solutions to cryptocurrency investing, more accredited investors and investment firms are inclined to join the sector and catalyze incoming capital.While DEX’s might be less efficient than centralized exchanges, the benefits of minimal transaction costs and user custody prove invaluable to investors processing large volume trades. AirSwap says it hopes to become the streamlined solution for OTC trading, which typically requires real-time negotiation and several days until settlement.AirSwap is also introducing requests for quotes (RFQs), which can be broadcast by liquidity takers to the entire network. Upon discovery, makers can select to respond and negotiate the terms of the trade in a quick, frictionless trading process.Source: AirSwapIt’s apparent that institutional investors may still be reluctant to trust a DEX platform for large investments. However, AirSwap hopes to mitigate security risks for its OTC trading feature by partnering with BitGo, a multi-signature wallet provider used frequently by high-end custody clients. BitGo recently added support for AirSwap’s AST tokens.AirSwap has also introduced a new identification interface, with verifications processed externally by Wyre, a regulated money services business (MSB). This feature ensures institutional investors that AirSwap is in compliance with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulatory policies.Targeting an institutional client base, AirSwap appears on its way to delivering decentralized digital asset trading to a spectrum of cryptocurrency investors.Posted In: Altcoins, Exchanges, KYC, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Facebook goes on record that it will not partner with Stellar, according to Cheddar.In a statement to the news outlet, a Facebook spokesperson said:“We are not engaged in any discussions with Stellar, and we are not considering building on their technology.”The news of the rumored partnership came shortly after a Business Insider article, published Aug. 10, noted that the social media behemoth has been speaking with several crypto projects, including Stellar, while it seeks ways to use blockchain technology.The article also noted that “Facebook could use blockchain technology to rival big banks’ payment networks.” However, it also stated that the social media site “already appears to be taking other steps to break into banking” and has considered “showing users their bank balance or fraud alerts.”The price of Stellar’s Lumens rose roughly 8 percent following Business Insider’s initial report.David Marcus Steps Down from CoinbaseIn addition to the fact that Facebook will not be partnering with Stellar, David Marcus of Facebook has stepped down from the Coinbase board, citing a conflict of interest, according to CoinDesk.Marcus, who has been with Facebook since 2014, joined the Coinbase board in December 2018 and according to Business Insider, also leads the Facebook blockchain team.In a statement to Cheddar, Marcus said:“Because of the new group I’m setting up at Facebook around blockchain, I’ve decided it was appropriate for me to resign from the Coinbase board.

442,CryptoSlate,IOHK Calls Out Ethereum’s Casper Protocol In Favor of Own “Ouroboros”,Shaurya Malwa,1534053600.0,"Based on two social discussions over Reddit, H.K.-based IOHK, the parent company of Cardano and Ethereum Classic blockchains, released a detailed comparison between Casper and Ouroboros, two proof-of-stake protocols.IOHK Hits OutStarting with the fundamentals, IOHK noted that Ouroboros is duly analyzed and contains a formally specified assumption for ensuring security guarantee. The proofs, model designs, and mechanism descriptions are all made public, thus making protocol properties, correctness proofs, and underlying assumptions open for scrutinization.The Ouroborous protocol, as written in the official statement, is said to provide the “strongest possible guarantees” regarding the stakes validating transactional operations.For the purposes of this comparative study, IOHK referred to the original version of Ouroboros published in 2017, including a majority of comments from Praos and Genesis updates, and the Friendly Fidelity Gadget (FFG) white paper for Casper, published in 2017 as well.IOHK pointed out the absence of published, publically available sources in the Casper protocol confirming its mode-of-operation or proving verifiable guarantees about the system. In this regard, the foundation stated Casper provides “much weaker guarantees” about the adversary stakes needed to operate the blockchain network, in addition to publishing several other points for proving their protocol as superior.Casper’s WoesFor the uninitiated, Casper is an innovative proof-of-stake system defined by Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir in November 2017. The protocol relies on all validators staking a portion of their ethers to validation transactions on blocks; rewarding the larger stakers with a higher reward and vice-versa.Malicious actors are quickly identified and appended from participating in the system, which triumphs over a proof-of-work protocol by mitigating the risk from mining groups participating in the dreaded 51 percent attack.The Face-offThe foundation compiled several aspects to compare, a few of which are listed below:Falsifiability of ClaimsIn the Ouroboros protocol, the participants’ programs are continually defined by the system, including interactions, transactions, executions, and communications with others. This prevents a corruption of the system by nefarious participants. Furthermore, the model helps satisfy mathematically-formulated security guarantees and liveness properties for the protocol.IOHK believes such a system is immensely well-defined and leaves nothing to “interpretation or reader perspective.” In contrast, the foundation states Casper has no such publically available documents or models present, rendering it “impossible” to prove the “correctness” of the Ethereum protocol.The statement added:“Good design intuition and best effort are just not sufficient when a ledger consensus protocol is supposed to carry assets worth billions.”“Proven” Ledger ConsensusIn terms of ledger consensus, IOHK defines the Ouroboros protocol as “proven” to liveness under clearly defined assumptions. However, Casper is merely a PoS enhancement atop a PoW “block proposal mechanism,” meaning the guarantee of the system’s security depends on the security of the proposed mechanism.IOHK pointed out the authors of Casper themselves noted that “a wholly compromised block proposal mechanism will prevent Casper from finalizing new blocks,” adding that certain versions of the Casper protocol, such as Casper FFG-RPJ, are “incomplete” and unaccompanied by any verifiable security mechanisms.ShardingIOHK compared its Hydra protocol to one of Ethereum’s most-awaited updates – Sharding – a proposed mechanism that validates transactions via node clusters specific to defined geographies instead of the globe. On paper, the protocol is primed to parabolically scale transactions as a large amount of processing power enters the system.The Hydra is said to be released shortly, along with a detailed white paper describing the problems solved, solutions deployed, mathematically functions used, and evidence of all proofs used.Meanwhile, IOHK called out the Sharding update’s lack of any documentation in terms of protocol description and quantifiable security proofs.Posted In: Cardano, Ethereum, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
443,CryptoSlate,Bitcoin Core Developer Revealed as Bitcoin Cash Bug Informant,Jonnie Emsley,1534071120.0,"After anonymously notifying Bitcoin ABC developers in April of a critical ‘chain-splitting’ bug in the Bitcoin Cash code, a Bitcoin Core developer has emerged to claim responsibility for the discovery — what he describes as a “wake-up call” for the entire cryptocurrency industry.In a post on Medium, Cory Fields revealed that he was the individual responsible for the anonymous tip-off, having alerted Bitcoin ABC of the SIGHASH_BUG on the 25th of April, 2018.According to Fields, the bug could have caused an unintended split in the Bitcoin Cash network — compromising the integrity of transactions, and potentially bringing the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to its knees.The vulnerability was addressed by the ABC team, however, and was announced to have been mitigated on May the 7th. Included in the incident report was a technical description of the issue:“An attacker may construct a malicious transaction which would be accepted by Bitcoin-ABC 0.17.0 and mined into a block. This block would be rejected by all other versions of Bitcoin Cash compliant implementations.”Having avoided what Fields described as the “potential for catastrophe”, Bitcoin ABC acknowledged the actions of their unknown hero and offered them an unspecified bounty.The Dangers of DisclosureFor Fields, however, anonymity meant safety.The developer explained that, had he openly disclosed the bug to ABC, he would be the first in the firing line if a hacker had exploited it — as the only identified individual to have knowledge of the vulnerability. Explaining his reasoning, Fields noted that “people have been killed for much less”:“I would have no way to prove that I was not the attacker. Then consider that, collectively, billions of dollars could have been lost as a result of this exploit. People have been killed for much less. So not only was anonymity important, I considered it a necessity for my safety.”Fields went on to explain that Bitcoin ABC’s lack of a responsible disclosure policy may be partly to blame — a legislation he describes as a “must-have for any security-critical project”.Where some would see the BCH bug as water under the bridge, Fields maintains that the issue was not endemic — and was a “real-world example” of the significant challenges facing all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. He wrote:“I’m often asked at conferences and workshops what I consider to be Bitcoin’s greatest challenge in the future. My answer is always the same: avoiding catastrophic software bugs.”According to the developer, all projects must be adequately prepared for any eventuality — one might entertain the idea that disclosure policy is the tip of the iceberg.

444,CryptoSlate,Augur: Fake Data Loophole Discovered by Bounty Hunter,Shaurya Malwa,1533776400.0,"Blockchain-based predictions marketplace Augur is under fire after a significant security vulnerability was uncovered by bounty hunters who could potentially be used to sift off millions of dollars.Betting on Augur’s Security?As per a report by The Next Web on Aug. 7, the decentralized betting platform has low levels of customer and interface security–allowing hackers to duplicate the platform, create fake datasets and rig betting outcomes.First published on HackerOne, a crowd-sourced ethical hacking platform that rewards users who detect bugs, ethical hacker droblin created a post that listed “Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security” as a “weakness” of the Augur protocol.The hacker listed some steps that made it possible to fake several aspects of the Augur protocol:Such attack vectors are called “frame jacking” by security experts, meaning a protocol’s underlying HTML code is manipulated and exploited by nefarious actors to gain control of the output. In this case, Augur’s prediction data.A “frame-jacked” user would view the correct domain name, but be shown false data originating from the hacker’s servers.Droblin explained the extent of such a vulnerability in his post on HackerOne:“User visits a link from the internet; an attacker replaces his Augur application data then–market data, Ethereum addresses, everything.”For a platform like Augur (REP), which relies solely on correct data and collated information to function, this lapse in security is insurmountable.The primary question arises of how data is manipulated when blockchain is fundamentally immutable, and the answer lies with Augur’s decision to store a certain number of files in local servers belonging to the company. Hence, while Augur’s blockchain is fully intact and working well, hackers have, or could have, manipulated the front end.For a project that raised $5.5 million in 2016, such poor design choices represent a single point of failure, especially considering the increased attention the cryptocurrency industry enjoys from hackers and other bad actors.Meanwhile, the security research blasted out on Augur’s comments on the HackerOne post after the company classified the hack under “medium severity:”The researcher also explored the possible consequences of such bugs,  after disagreeing with its medium-grade severity classification by the Augur team. Droblin stated:“Someone could find it and just create post a Medium or somewhere else, describing how is it easy to hijack Augur’s UI data,”And added:“This stupid, simple, small and critical bug was found in Augur’s bug bounty program, the one with very high bonuses for essential bugs and meager expectations for such bugs being actually found.”While the post has since been taken down and Augur’s developers have maintained their classification of the incident, droblin was paid $5,000 in bounties, up from the standard $1,500 amount for that level of severity.Related: Augur Prediction Market Confirms First $20K in Bets Have Paid OutCryptoSlate first reported on the enterprising and successful launch of the prediction marketplace in July, finding that the platform paid out $20,000 to punters in its first week, spread across a wide range of betting markets.There may be a few malevolent aspects to Augur’s platform, courtesy of the decentralized, open-for-all, censor-free derivatives markets.Celebrities assassinations, for instance, also became a hot topic for the platform in July ahead of other forms of betting, such as sports or weather forecasts.Posted In: Altcoins, Derivatives, Hacks     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
445,CryptoSlate,Ethereum Classic Remains Immune to Market Volatility as Coinbase Finalizes ETC Support,Sam Town,1533555000.0,"Ethereum Classic has firmly entrenched itself as one of the biggest gainers for the last week of July 2018, rising 14% subsequent to Coinbase’s confirmation that ETC support is expected to roll out in the next few days.ETC prices have risen steadily since the announcement, pushing against a bearish Bitcoin value held down by negative BTC market sentiment. Coinbase’s public affirmation of ETC support, issued on August 3, heralds the impending integration of Ethereum Classic support into the list of Coinbase-supported cryptocurrencies.Our engineering team is beginning final testing of Ethereum Classic on Coinbase products.

Inbound transfers will be enabled for 24-48 hours via Coinbase Pro and Coinbase Prime before trading is enabled, placing the launch of live ETC trading between August 8 and 9.The launch of ETC trading on Coinbase Markets will be preceded by a post-only opening of ETC books with a minimum duration of 10 minutes in order to establish sufficient liquidity, at which point ETC trading will be enabled on Pro and Prime.Coinbase Consumer accounts can expect to wait between one and two weeks for ETC support, with Coinbase stating that Consumer customers won’t be entitled to Ethereum Classic credits:“Ethereum was not supported on Coinbase Consumer until after the fork, therefore there are no corresponding Ethereum Classic credits for Coinbase Consumer customers.”Ethereum Classic Volume IncreasesEthereum Classic trading volume has surged subsequent to the Coinbase announcement, with daily volume currently exceeding $230 million USD. With daily Ethereum Classic transactions breaking through the 50,000 level and the current rollout of Coinbase GBP support, it’s possible that ETC could experience a dramatic breakout after Coinbase ETC consumer support is implemented in late August.

447,CryptoSlate,IOHK Launches Cardano Blockchain Smart Contract “IELE” Testnet,Shaurya Malwa,1533110400.0,"On July 30, 2018, the IOHK Foundation announced the launch of the second Cardano testnet, the IELE virtual machine (VM) smart contract update.Cardano “IELE”As published on their official website, developers can now experiment with smart contracts technology based on the Cardano blockchain and test it for bugs and other nuances which can be passed on to IOHK developers for troubleshooting.The protocol’s parent body believes the launch is an essential step in Cardano’s development and community promises, apart from offering a “robust and reliable financial infrastructure.”The IELE VM is built on an “attendant low-level language” to ensure developer inclusivity and is primarily designed to execute smart contracts on the Cardano’s protocol. The update is a collaborative effort between IOHK and Runtime Verification, a global research body. The former provided funding for the project while the latter provided technical expertise.Salient FeaturesThe IELE focuses on fulfilling the rising demand for transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in the global markets by making it an easy-to-use platform which developers could make beneficial use of. Some of the protocol’s salient features are as follows:Providing Solidity compilation support and other widely-used computer languages. Solidity is the framework of Ethereum and enjoys substantial interest from the younger develop community.Serving as a platform to translate and execute smart contracts from “high level” languages.Providing a uniform GAS model, across all languages.Providing a “correct by construction” language that auto-corrects any code errors during writing, instead of waiting for the compilation stage.The IELE can be further classified into two categories: a “correct by construction” VM interface and a Solidity-to-IELE compiler component, both designed using Cardano’s K framework.As stated by IOHK:“With this update, Solidity programs will catch many of the errors that previously would have been missed and that have caused many smart contracts to fail or be exploited.”IOHK revealed Python, Javascript, and other such “surface languages” will be integrated into the platform as the development of IELE progresses, providing an easy method for deploying smart contracts on everyday applications.Testnet and Feedback EncouragedCurrently, the IELE language and VM are ready to be deployed on to the Cardano blockchain in weeks to come. Meanwhile, developers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts can use the IELE VM with either Remix or Mallet tools for executing and creating their engineered smart contracts using the IOHK testnet site.Apart from Cardano, cryptocurrency protocols like NEO, Hyperledger, Ethereum offer smart contract capabilities to individuals and organizations. Of these, Ethereum is arguably the most popular, as was evidenced recently in a cross-border almond shipping trade route between Australia and Germany, as reported by CryptoSlate.However, the IOHK alleged that businesses had encountered technical issues while trying to integrate smart contracts into their existing infrastructure. The foundation called out DAO hacks and Parity bugs to prove its point and stated the bugs continue to reappear despite widespread publicity about the snags.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
448,CryptoSlate,"Tron (TRX) Achieves 2000 TPS, Surpasses Ethereum",Jonathan Kim,1532916000.0,"Tron’s recent mainnet launch marked its official migration from the Ethereum blockchain. Following its partnership with BitTorrent, Tron’s new blockchain has achieved 2000 transactions per second (TPS).Justin Sun and “The World’s Largest Decentralized Ecosystem”Tron was able to reach speeds of 2000 TPS following its mainnet launch, according to a company blog post. Migrating completely off the Ethereum network, Tron is now boasting speeds 80 times that of its greatest competitor.TRON is 80 times faster than Ethereum. With 14 years of experience, @BitTorrent is providing a world-class service to 100 million users in 138 countries. Add the two together and you get the largest and most advanced peer-to-peer network in the world! #TRONBT $TRX pic.twitter.com/EsQd34Vq4u— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) July 27, 2018On July 27, 2018, Tron CEO Justin Sun boasted the potential of Tron’s $140 million acquisition of BitTorrent in a tweet and dubbed the company, “the world’s largest decentralized ecosystem.”BitTorrent is the owner and operator of popular torrent client µTorrent, which reportedly has over 100 million active users and runs up to 40% of the world’s internet traffic on a daily basis, according to its website.Earlier this month, Sun announced his campaign to run for one of 27 block producer positions on the Tron network and was elected the day following, garnering 120 million votes by TRON token holders in under 24 hours.TRON vs. EthereumTron is able to exceed Ethereum’s maximum 25 TPS by using an adjusted delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism known as TPOS.27 TRON “super representatives” are elected to make structure and governance decisions on behalf of the greater community. A TRON super representative acts as a key node on the Tron protocol – capable of validating transactions, creating new blocks on the network and competing for block rewards.Related: Co-Founder Joseph Lubin: ‘Ethereum Entering Phase 2’On a blockchain-based operating system, a smaller number of nodes means quicker transaction confirmations and higher throughput.Ethereum’s future Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism requires that more than 13,000 active Ethereum nodes verify each transaction before it’s confirmed – causing low TPS and a susceptibility to congestion.In light of these scalability issues, Ethereum is pursuing second-layer solutions, such as plasma and sharding.Sharding is a scaling solution that uses micro-chains – call shards, to process separate types of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain – requiring only a group of nodes to verify relevant transactions rather than the entire network.Similar to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, plasma adds a second layer of off-chain branches to the Ethereum main chain in order to process high-volume smart contract protocols more quickly, updating the base layer only when transactions are complete.Related: TRON (TRX) Independence Day – Project Officially Breaks Away from EthereumEach second-layer system is meant to improve scalability on the platform by running dApps independently from the Ethereum main chain. On July 10, Co-founder Joseph Lubin said that Ethereum was moving onto ‘Phase 2’ of development.Both competing smart contract platforms have made extravagant claims at the potential speeds of TRON and Ethereum.In early June, Vitalik Buterin told viewers in an OmiseGO AMA that Ethereum could potentially achieve 1 million TPS once second-layer solutions were fully integrated. Prior to their mainnet launch, TRON CEO Justin Sun stated in a tweet that the network aims to eventually achieve 10,000 TPS – a major selling point for early dApp developers building large-scale projects.Posted In: Ethereum, Tron, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
449,CryptoSlate,Mastercard CEO: “Cryptocurrency is Junk”,Jonnie Emsley,1532750400.0,"Just days after Mastercard filed a patent to link fiat and cryptocurrency transactions, the payment giant’s CEO lashes out at cryptocurrency — once again describing the asset class as “junk” that should not serve as a medium of value-transfer.As a board member of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, President and CEO Ajay Banga argued during the 6th New India lecture in New York, that the volatility and anonymity of “cryptocurrency” debase its worth as a “medium of exchange”.I think cryptocurrency is junk. The idea of an anonymized currency produced by people who have to mine it, the value of which can fluctuate wildly – that to me is not the way that any medium of exchange deserves to be considered as a medium of exchange,According to CNBC, the Indian executive went on to claim that cryptocurrency is used for 95% of all nefarious purchases made on the dark web — including narcotics sales and credit card fraud.While the comments would offer much-needed vindication to crypto-naysayers, they may highlight some of the common misconceptions surrounding cryptocurrency — held even by industry heavyweights such as Banga.Volatile?Like any other emerging asset, cryptocurrencies tend to be prone to volatility as Banga claims. To discredit their usage on account of this quality, however, would ignore the solutions offered by stable coins — which nullify price fluctuation and remain constant in value, and perhaps the more organic, long-term solution — stabilization of price as the industry matures.Anonymous?Where cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin provide more anonymity than third-party payment systems, they are not in fact anonymous. As they link all transactions to an individual’s public key, they are arguably less anonymous than (physical) cash transfers. Several privacy coins that use various cryptographic techniques to mask identity and transactional data — such as Dash, Monero, or Zcash — may indeed be anonymous, however.Debaucherous?In describing a cryptocurrency that must be mined, Banga is presumably referring to Bitcoin, the largest and well-known cryptocurrency. Defining the exact number of Bitcoin transactions involved in criminal activity may be an impossible task. However, a January 2018 report filed at the University of Sydney puts the number at 44% — less than half of Banga’s figure of 95% — and a figure that should invariably shrink under the weight of worldwide regulation.A number of corporate executives may feel an affinity for Banga’s claims, namely, JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, and BlackRock’s Larry Fink — both of whom have slandered cryptocurrency in spite of the positions of the corporations they represent.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
450,CryptoSlate,EOS Block Producers Vote to Raise RAM Supply to Lower Cost of Running dApps,Jonathan Kim,1532689200.0,"After a turbulent launch, the EOS mainnet faced further issues with its controversial network constitution and a shortage of RAM supply. On July 26, 2018, EOS block producers voted to increase the RAM supply and lower costs for developing applications on the network.EOS RAM Supply DoublesOn July 26, EOS block producers voted to double the network’s supply of RAM – effectively lowering the cost of launching decentralized applications (dApps) on the network.In order to distribute RAM across the network, the EOSIO Dawn 4.0 mainnet uses an updated market-based allocation approach allowing token holders to buy and sell database space at prevailing market prices.Decentralized applications require a significant amount of memory space to store temporary data for their programs, which developers can purchase with EOS on the EOS RAM market. Opening a new EOS account also requires a minimum of 4kb of RAM, putting the current cost of onboarding a new user at about 3.5 EOS or $30.15.Although an innovative solution to RAM distribution, the market-based approach leaves the allocation of RAM susceptible to shortages and price inflation.Related: Hoarders Drive EOS RAM Market Prices Beyond AffordabilityRecently, the network faced a centralization issue, with hoarders and speculators holding nearly 85% of the network’s RAM capacity – preventing developers from accessing necessary RAM for building and deploying dApps.With over 85% of available RAM being kept by select individuals, the demand for the scarce developer resource was driving prices beyond affordability.On July 4, the cost of 1MB of RAM was approximately 715 EOS (~$6455 USD), according to data by MarketstackD.Block producers have the power to resolve issues with RAM capacity by voting to add new RAM to the network. On July 24, 15 of 21 active block producers voted to approve the network upgrade and increase the EOS RAM capacity from 64GB to 128GB. Requiring 15 votes to pass, the upgrade is currently in effect and will increase RAM capacity at 1kb per block (~120kb per minute) until it reaches 128GB.Source: MarketstackDSince the block producer voting session, RAM prices have fallen significantly with 1MB of RAM costing approximately 235 EOS at press time. The current RAM capacity utilization is at 76.2%, according to data by MarketstackD.Posted In: EOS, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

The platform will allow customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency at the best value among all the venues.As many only check exchanges they use most like Huobi, Binance, or Coinbase, the Voyager believes it excels by showing prices of 10 different cryptocurrency exchanges and three additional market makers.The Voyager staff includes current CEO Stephen Ehrlich – former E*Trade CEO and founder of Lightspeed Financial and CEO Oscar Salazar, founding Uber architect and chief technology officer. Stephen Ehrlich told Fortune in an exclusive interview,“we saw an opportunity to build a dynamic smart order router that can take advantage of the marketplace and also offer customers no commissions.”Beta Testing & Crypto DecisionsThe last week of July 2018, Voyager will enter beta testing and hopes to release the full product by the end of October 2018. Cryptocurrency news and analysis features are expected to be added to the mobile app to help investors make buying and selling decisions.The list of the 15 cryptocurrencies Voyager will trade is currently still being finalized, Ehrlich asserted,“If you see it being traded today by some of the most prominent players, we will definitely have those plus some.”However, the CEO states that his company is “leaning towards” other currencies that aren’t listed by other major U.S. exchanges such as Ripple and Stellar.Voyager’s free trading product has already been approved in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Montana and hopes to operate in at least 40 U.S. states. Approval for all fifty states will take time, and the company already has pending applications with the state of New York.Ehrlich concluded his interview with Fortune by saying:“We don’t think crypto has been adopted yet by the masses in the United States. I believe the market space itself is extremely large…We think the opportunity for both retail and institutional is vast, and we want to be part of that, and help the industry grow, and be good citizens to the industry, and help people get more knowledgeable in crypto assets.”Posted In: Altcoins, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
452,CryptoSlate,"Skrill Adds Wallet Support for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum",Shaurya Malwa,1532660400.0,"On July 25, 2018, London-based Skrill announced its support of four major cryptocurrencies on its popular wallet application.Skrill’s Cryptocurrency PushAs per a report on Finance Magnates, Skrill added Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum currency options for its customer base of over 25 million spread worldwide.Customers can now buy and sell the cryptocurrencies using any of the 40 available fiat currency options, including USD, EUR, SGD, and NZD. The digital wallet and mobile payments facilitator was founded in 2001 as “Moneybookers,” and rebranded to Skrill in 2011.Customers from over 30 countries can directly purchase digital assets via the Skrill platform, including UAE, Australia, and Canada.It must be noted the update was not rolled out to U.S. and Russia, two critical digital payment markets, due to strict legislation around cryptocurrencies.The update is the payment provider’s first step in the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector, joining a small list of other providers which now offer similar services. Interestingly, Skrill offers licensed gambling and sport betting applications in a few jurisdictions, and it remains to be seen if the addition of cryptocurrencies increases, or decreasing, the controversial recreational activities.Lorenzo Pellegrino, the CEO of Skrill and sister-company Neteller, expressed his opinion on the newly-launched cryptocurrency feature:“The world of cryptocurrency trading is exciting and dynamic, and our digital wallet service very much lends itself to this environment.”Neteller to Introduce Cryptocurrencies SoonPellegrino added that customers would now have the ability to “easily and quickly” via Skill’s platform and fully expects the service to remain until the far future.

453,CryptoSlate,Audi Think Tank to Explore IOTA’s Tangle,Jonnie Emsley,1532649600.0,"IOTA and Audi Denkwerkstatt — the German car manufacturer’s think tank — have teamed up to explore the Tangle for building a permissionless mobility ecosystem, together embarking on a one-week Google Design Sprint in Berlin.#IOTA Foundation: Audi Think Tank & IOTA Foundation explore Tangle-based mobility use caseshttps://t.co/Q4dJXTEA9P#IOTA #Mobility #miota— IOTA News (@iotatokennews) July 25, 2018Starting July 25, 2018, the collaboration will include the production of a low-level prototype, gathering customer feedback, and exploring usage cases for IOTA’s Directed Acrylic Graph (DAG) ledger technology.This is not the first time IOTA has piqued the interest of the automobile industry, with Volkswagen announcing in June 2018 it will tap into the Tangle to distribute trusted vehicle software over-the-air.While this is IOTA’s first outing with luxury car giant Audi, the IOTA team hint at hopes of having a productive relationship — stating on their blog:This new way of working is exemplary for how car manufacturers approach innovation and is a great opportunity for IOTA to be maybe integrated into a new mobility solution with expertise from Audi.Audi Denkwerkstatt (translated “the Audi ideas workshop”) focuses on developing a variety of products and business models in tandem with members from the digital ecosystem. While mobility is a central concern of Audi’s research outfit, a number of IOTA’s strong-suits would appear to be of interest to the 15-member think tank, who seek “innovations in the areas of HR, IT, data security, sales, finance or similar.”IOTA: Making WavesAccording to IOTA, their technology couldn’t be a better fit for the job. In an announcement on the IOTA blog, the team described their open source protocol as being “predestined” to revolutionize “any kind of business ideas that rely on trust in data, scalable & safe machine to machine communication & transaction settlement.”IOTA — the 9th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization — would appear to be continuing its impressive momentum in 2018, with a number of equally heavy-hitting corporations and political bodies announced their commitment to utilizing the Tangle, most recently the United Nations and the Norwegian Bank. As IOTA sees the addition of smart contracts with its long-awaited Qubic upgrade, the Germany-based project may prove unprecedented utility for DAG technology.Posted In: IOTA, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

The company believes its synergy with Stellar would help augment its operations in developing nations and while making cross-border payments cheaper.The partnership represents a win-win situation for both involved parties. Stellar network participants can now utilize TransferTo’s deep network in underdeveloped markets. The latter is said to have processed over 100 million transactions since its launch in 2005.Speaking of the development, TransferTo acknowledged Stellar’s protocol that boasts of speedy transactions and high-security data storage. Not considering hacks from third-party services, the Stellar network has impressively not found itself in any major security breaches since its inception in April 2015.The release stated:“By partnering with Stellar our goal is to trial the blockchain technology and scale our cross-border payment service to better serve our partners and reduce costs. This can enable our partners to better serve both the migrant workers sending money home and their families receiving it.”Stellar regarded the partnership as a noteworthy development for expanding their current and potential future network, alongside continuing to “drive greater financial inclusion” for the underbanked market.Stellar’s Blockchain DominanceFor the uninitiated, the blockchain-based Stellar platform provides a smooth transaction execution system and fast payment settlements aimed at individuals, banks, and financial institutions to process cheap cross-border payments in real time, using its native XLM token or the Stellar protocol.The project received positive press in recent times after several progressive developments for both foundation and token.In June 2018, Stellar acquired Chain, a San Francisco-based blockchain startup in a deal worth $500 million of XLM tokens. The company offers a “cloud blockchain” services for organizations willing to integrate the technology into existing infrastructure.As reported by CryptoSlate on July 18, 2018, Stellar was certified “halal” by the Islamic scholars of Shariah Review Bureau (SRB). In effect, XLM became the first cryptocurrency to receive Sharia compliance certification and integrate with financial firms in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, two Islam-dominated regions.Posted In: Stellar, Adoption, Altcoins, Partnerships, Payments     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
455,CryptoSlate,Bitcoin.com Accused of Strong-Arm Tactics Over Bitcoin Cash Exchange Listings,Sam Town,1532590200.0,"Roger Ver’s campaign to promote Bitcoin Cash (BCH) adoption has sparked debate in the cryptocurrency community after the release of an email exchange between crypto trading platform Bity and Bitcoin.com.Details published by Bity via Reddit on July 25, 2018, reveal a new tactic from the Bitcoin.com team to promote the adoption and usage of BCH, offering crypto exchanges that don’t list the Bitcoin fork as a choice — to list BCH, or face being delisted from the Bitcoin.com “buy Bitcoin” database.Bity will soon be taken off https://t.co/OAor8jWA1X's exchange listings page. Here's a post from our team explaining why: https://t.co/FSgws6Yaqf— Bity (@bity) July 24, 2018Ultimatum Draws IreThe Bity team published an email exchange between the Swiss cryptocurrency exchange and Bitcoin.com in which the Bitcoin.com team purportedly delivered an ultimatum dictating that the platform must list BCH within 30 days:“We are making a change on our exchange listing requirements that all listed exchanges must offer Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in order to remain listed on our website. For exchanges that we currently list who do not meet this requirement, they will be removed from the exchange listings page and won’t be offered as an option moving forward unless this requirement is met.”Bity, as a Switzerland-based cryptocurrency exchange, is unable to identify a use case for BCH in the country, as the local crypto-economy is based primarily around Ethereum and Bitcoin — as outlined in the Bity response to the Bitcoin.com team’s directive:“In Switzerland there is currently no economy that we are aware of which uses BCH. There are no cases of businesses being built around the direct use of BCH, unlike with Ethereum (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC) … We have not seen any real use cases in Switzerland or with our user base of BCH that shows potential to be integrated in the future financial system.”BCH Drama ContinuesBitcoin.com appears to back up the threat of delisting with the statement that the platform is one of the “ top most viewed websites in the cryptocurrency space with millions of views per month.” Bitcoin.com, however, is not the only crypto site that has delisting platforms that don’t conform to their perspective — Bitcoin.com was removed from the CoinMarketCap Bitcoin Page in early May 2018.Data from the Internet Archive shows Bitcoin.com listed as “website 2” on the CoinMarketCap Bitcoin page, whereas the current page only lists Bitcoin.org as the official Bitcoin website.Bity, however, is remaining diplomatic regarding Bitcoin.com’s high-pressure BCH listing tactics, stating that the Bity exchange platform is crypto-agnostic:“We would also like to share that we are crypto agnostic and we understand that things can change in the future. If we see a change in market behaviour towards BCH then we would reconsider offering it on our platform”Posted In: Bitcoin Cash, Altcoins, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Taking it to the extreme, Augur users created the first assassination prediction markets prediction on the platform.A decentralized prediction market, Augur’s open-source protocol gives users complete control over which markets they create and trade on – letting people bet on anything from weather predictions and election outcomes to the life expectancy of the current U.S. president.Source: gateway.ipfs.ioAssassination markets are inevitable on a platform with uncensored flexibility. Although not the most popular, similar markets have emerged. Augur users are gambling on whether U.S. Senator John McCain and actress Betty White will survive until 2019 – stirring legal and ethical controversy around the unregulated prediction market platform.The obvious danger in illegal assassination markets is that users could bet on the death of a public figure and go on to instigate or actually murder that person for profit. The mere existence of such markets may perhaps cause these events to be more likely to occur, even if only incrementally.A few decentralized application (dApp) browsers are removing search results for markets related to celebrity deaths, but the decentralized nature of Augur’s mainnet makes it impossible to truly remove these markets from the network.Augur ‘Kill Switch’ and ‘Wisdom of the Crowd’Until July 23, 2018, Augur’s developers held a network “kill switch” that could lock up all contracts under dire security breaches or technical failures to save the platform from further hacking. However, the successful launch of the platform gave developers the confidence to transfer ownership of the kill switch to a burn address, decentralizing control over the network.Happy two weeks! 🎉 Ownership of the escape hatch has been transferred to the 0x000..0001 address.— Augur (@AugurProject) July 24, 2018With the removal of the centralized kill switch, some question whether Augur is avoiding liability for the potential illegal outcomes of assassination prediction markets among other illicit betting schemes.Foreseeing the possibility of such behavior on the network, Augur has enabled users, called “Reporters,” to flag specific markets deemed unethical and prevent further betting on them.Related: Augur Prediction Market Confirms First $20K in Bets Have Paid OutHowever, the network relies on a “wisdom of the crowd” principle that entrusts reporters with such powers without any real incentive to do so. In fact, reporters can be penalized for flagging markets as unethical if done so incorrectly.How Augur will maintain its decentralized immutability and user control while remaining an ethical, legally-compliant platform is yet to be uncovered.For more information about Augur, including price, market cap, founders and technical information, visit the CryptoSlate Augur coin profile.Posted In: Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

459,CryptoSlate,eToro Releases Cardano (ADA) Market Research Report,Chelsea Roh,1531983600.0,"On July 17, 2018, eToro, the world’s largest social investing platform, published a market research report on Cardano – the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market cap.The Cardano research summary by eToro’s Senior Market Analyst, Mati Greenspan dives into Cardano’s team, history, development, use cases, technical components, and it’s roadmap.Cardano DevelopmentGreenspan begins by outlining Cardano’s origin. Together with Jeremy Wood, Charles Hoskinson, former co-founder of Ethereum, founded Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) – the entity responsible for the funding and development of the Cardano network.Related Article: IOHK Redesigns Cardano With Brand Refresh, Releases Updated ADA RoadmapThe report explains that the first part of the network, Byron, was released to the public on September 29th, 2017 and was quickly introduced in several major cryptocurrency exchanges.Cardano is still in its early stages of development and its new version, Shelley, is anticipated to be released at the end of 2018 or by April 2019. Shelley will introduce key elements for a decentralized and secure Cardano network.After Shelley, there are three subsequent phases of Cardano – Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. Goguen will showcase a language specifically designed for Cardano and implement a virtual machine while Voltaire and Basho are designated for the scalability of the Cardano network and focus on governance.Greenspan commented on the development of Cardano:“Even though Cardano is still in the early stages of it’s [sic] roadmap it is definitely one of the most promising blockchain projects we’ve ever seen. It is also the first blockchain project that is being developed using a collective scientific philosophy, based on peer-reviewed scientific research. A great number of its most important features are still under development.”Cardano Use CasesThe report details that Cardano implements a ‘complete’ blockchain-based environment where smart contracts, decentralized applications, and secure, quick transactions are readily available.Greenspan outlines various industries that could use or be disrupted by Cardano, and include:Financial ServicesOfficial RecordsSupply Chain ManagementAccountingDecentralized Applications (dApp)Third generation blockchains, like Cardano, aim to develop more scalable and sustainable networks that maintain privacy and the security and governance of the most established projects in the cryptocurrency space.Proof-of-Work (PoW) vs. Proof-of-Stake (PoS)The report then goes into Cardano’s consensus algorithm– which is what separates Cardano from Ethereum and Bitcoin. The Proof-of-Work algorithm, used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum, has proven to be costly in terms of the amount of energy required to mine.Cardano uses Ouroboros, a Proof-of-Stake algorithm that does not require any mining. Instead, the blocks on the blockchain are generated by stakeholders.Future Developments of CardanoThe reward system for the stakeholders will be later deployed, as Shelley is the top priority for the Cardano team. Currently, the Cardano network is run by nodes controlled by the three governing bodies of Cardano– IOHK, the Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo.The Cardano team follows the strategy of releasing its new, thoroughly-tested developments, one-by-one, to avoid potential complications with the code upon release.Cardano also keeps a running interactive roadmap for its investors and enthusiasts, which tracks project progress in percentage from completion.The interactive roadmap is accessible here.Accessible RisksAt the end of the eToro Cardano research report, investment risks with cryptocurrency and smart investing guidelines are explained by Greenspan:“Cryptocurrency markets are associated with high volatility, and Cardano is no exception. The project is still in a relatively early stage, and the roadmap is very long, so although the potential of the project is vast, as outlined in the previous sections, it is important to consider that the short-term fluctuations will depend mostly on speculation.”   Cardano 9 Apr at 6:43 pm UTC$0.04  2.55%Cardano, currently ranked #12 by market cap, is up 2.55% over the past 24 hours.

461,CryptoSlate,Research: Illegal Cryptocurrency Mining May Have Reached Its Peak As Monero Prices Plunge,Shaurya Malwa,1531875600.0,"The burgeoning cryptocurrency sector gave rise to scores of unauthorized cryptocurrency mining malware infiltrating millions of computers worldwide. However, recent reports suggest the prominent hacking method may lose its relevance soon.Cryptojacking Losing Sheen?As reported by ZDNet on July 17, 2018, cybercriminals utilizing malicious software to mine cryptocurrencies are ironically facing the brunt of the energy-intensive activity as meager profits fail to justify their ill-intent.For the uninitiated, the process of illegally gaining access to a victim’s computing resources for mining cryptocurrencies on the hacker’s behalf – popularly known as “crypto-jacking” – gained traction in 2018 after being classified as an easy method to earn money.Hackers use unsuspicious looking emails or infiltrate gaming servers to infect smartphones, PCs, and even Amazon Firesticks, to secretly steal computing power.The anonymity of blockchain technology adds on to the appeal of cryptojacking as criminals do not face risks of identification. Additionally, the process allows for maintaining a presence for a more extended period than other hacking methods, as most users do not notice a slower PC or noisier fan.Reports suggest the illicit activity even superseded ransomware as a preference for hackers within a short period. The Q2 2018 Cybercrime Tactics and Techniques report by security researchers Malwarebytes indicates the fad may have begun its decline.Research FindingsThe report noted a stark decrease in the number of cryptojacking instances in recent months, with only 1.5 million detections of mining software in June 2018 compared to over 5 million in March 2018.Business corporations were significantly affected by the mining plague as well, yet, only 30,000 security compromises were noted in June 2018 compared to 100,000 in January 2018.However, hackers need to gain control over an extensive network of computers to make the efforts worthwhile, as cryptocurrency mining is an intensive activity requiring both patience and energy.Jérôme Segura, a security researcher at Malwarebytes, stated:“Simply compromising a few hundred sites with a web miner alone is not going to yield very much, since those hacked sites typically have low traffic.”XMR Prices Affect Hackers’ IntentThe report notes the decline in the prices of Monero (XMR), seemingly most preferred by crypto-jackers for the ease-of-access the CoinHive miner software provides, as a noticeable contributor towards the decline. The privacy-centric cryptocurrency traded at over $470 in December 2017 and is valued at $146 at the time of writing.Related Story: Tesla Hit By CryptojackingApart from the financial benefits, security firms have swiftly updated their software mechanism to prevent the installation of illegal mining programs on computers.Segura noted that cryptojacking was a “ripe for abuse” method when it initially gained prominence, however, the technique is now shielded from misuse, which forces attackers to “rethink their strategies.”Additional ConcernsMeanwhile, Malwarebytes expresses concerns over the resurgence of ransomware and other cyber-crimes after the decline in cryptojacking. The agency fears hackers may return to holding sensitive data hostage in return for a substantial payment – possibly demanded in cryptocurrency.However, the report also stated that cryptojacking may lose popularity, but will not be completely mitigated. This is reasonably possible as public interest in cryptocurrencies remains strong and the sector is experiencing a rise in optimal regulations and technical developments.Posted In: Monero, Altcoins, Mining, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

He stated:“I do not own any Ether. I have zero Ether. Historical fact — I’ve never actually owned any Ether my entire life. I was entitled to 293 thousand Ether — I didn’t take it. I told them: give it to someone else.”Where the figure may appear generous, it constitutes less than 2.5 % of the project’s initial allocation — nearly 12 million ETH being set aside solely for the Ethereum Foundation during the July 2014 initial public sale. Today, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, worth more than $45 billion at time of press.Hoskinson did not detail his reasoning for denying the sum, yet one might point to the developer’s contentious exit from the Ethereum team. After a creative disagreement with Vitalik Buterin — who conceptualized the smart contract platform in 2013 — Hoskinson departed in June 2014. Speaking of his exit, Hoskinson told Forbes:“At the time I was pretty pissed off, Ether went up [to a market cap of] $120 billion, so what the hell do I know?”Hoskinson’s feelings of stagnation would appear to have been fleeting, however. In 2015, the Colorado-born entrepreneur and mathematician teamed up with former Ethereum colleague Jeremy Wood to found prominent blockchain firm IOHK — the creators of Cardano.Related: Coinbase Exploring the Addition of Cardano, Basic Attention Token, Stellar Lumens, Zcash, and 0xAs previously reported by CryptoSlate, Cardano (ADA) is one of five coins currently being considered for addition by Coinbase:Now the 8th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Cardano’s success would presumably have paved the way for Hoskinson’s ascension to Forbes’ ‘Crypto Rich List’ — his net worth estimated at $500-600 million as of February 2018.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, People     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

465,CryptoSlate,"Coinbase’s New Listing Candidates: What Are Cardano, Basic Attention Token, Stellar Lumens, Zcash, and 0x?",Sam Town,1531717200.0,"Coinbase’s recent admission that the highly popular cryptocurrency brokerage platform is considering the addition of five more crypto assets has seen the values of each potential token surge dramatically subsequent to the announcement.The potential candidates for new listings are Cardano, Basic Attention Token, Stellar Lumens, Zcash, and 0x, all of which perform different functions, ranging from the establishment of decentralized exchanges, to facilitating completely private transactions, to completely restructuring the digital advertising industry.CardanoThe first in the list of potential new Coinbase listing tokens, Cardano, is an academia-driven blockchain platform that utilizes a unique consensus method with the goal of applying blockchain technology to a range of different disciplines.Related: An Introduction to Cardano: A Decentralized Smart Contract PlatformThe Cardano Project, which began in 2015, launched on September 29, 2017, and implements an innovative development process that involves small groups of academics and developers competing with peer-reviewed research, integrating the ability to upgrade post-deployed systems without hard forks.Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson highlighted the effectiveness of the Cardano development philosophy in a recent interview with Finance Magnates, anticipating that the project will supplant the current blockchain ecosystem leaders within the next year:“To be frank, within 6 months or a year, we will be pound-for-pound better than Ethereum and Bitcoin in every dimension and aspect, just based on how our roadmap is rolling out. That’s just generation one.“Basic Attention TokenThe Basic Attention Token is essential to the development of the Brave browser project, which intends to dramatically reform the entire structure of the digital advertising industry.Related: An Introduction to Basic Attention Token (BAT) – Blockchain-Based Digital AdvertisingBrave is focused on decentralizing the slow, cumbersome, and highly centralized digital and online advertising market by incentivizing consumers with tokens for viewing advertisements, permitting advertisers to bypass the issues present within the current advertising ecosystem.The digital advertising market, in its existing form, is rift with middlemen, high overheads, and fraudulent advertising impressions driven by bots. The Brave browser and BAT ecosystem permit advertisers to determine exactly how many impressions their advertisements capture, and has recently exceeded 3 million users worldwide.Brave founder and CEO Brendan Eich summarized the core goals of the Brave project in a recent interview with Panama Crypto:“Brave is for users who have the courage to defend their data against tracking and advertising, to support their favorite websites and YouTube creators directly, and if they choose to, be paid for their attention.”Stellar LumensStellar Lumens are native tokens used on the Stellar Network, a blockchain project that aims to bridge the gap between the opposing worlds of cryptocurrency and traditional centralized financial institutions. Using a federated byzantine agreement model that began as a fork of Ripple, Stellar is specifically designed to facilitate streamlined, low-cost international remittance.Related: Introduction to Stellar Lumens (XLM) – The Future of BankingStellar works by allowing users to transmit credit that is equivalent to fiat currencies over the Stellar blockchain, which issued by “anchors” —  approved financial institutions that bridge the gap between fiat and crypto.In addition to streamlining and lowering the cost of international remittance, Stellar also offers built-in features that let organizations to issue their own tokens, as well as, surprisingly, a build in decentralized exchange that lets ICOs completely avoid the costly and frustrating exchange listing process.Stellar founder Jed McCaleb commented on the similarities between the Stellar project and Ripple in February, noting the core philosophical differences between the two platforms in an interview with Block Zero:“At a philosophical level, we set up (Stellar) as a nonprofit because, like the Internet, I think it needs to be [as] open and neutral as possible. If you imagine the Internet created by a for-profit company, it just would be a very different world.”ZcashZcash is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency created as a fork of the Bitcoin project, beginning life as “Zerocoin protocol” before rebranding. Unlike Bitcoin, with Zcash users can choose between making public, open transactions, or private transactions that are facilitated by zk-SNARKs, or zero-knowledge proofs.Related Story: Introduction to Zcash (ZEC) – Zero-Knowledge CryptographyThe Zcash team likens the operation of the Zcash network to that of the internet — if Bitcoin can be considered equivalent to unencrypted HTTP, Zcash is equivalent to encrypted HTTPS.The major draw point of the Zcash platform is the extremely effective obfuscation methods used to ensure user privacy. Zcash founding scientist and zk-SNARKs co-inventor provided a succinct explanation of the Zcash zk-SNARKs privacy shield via Fortune last year:“It’s like a magical restaurant bill where the items are blanked out but the restaurant can’t cheat you, even if you can’t see the individual sums.”0xThe potential addition of 0x to Coinbase is arguably the most forward-leaning of the listing quintet. 0x functions as an open, permissionless protocol that allows for the trading of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Essentially, the 0x Protocol aims to power decentralized exchanges that facilitate the trading of virtually any kind of crypto asset.Related Story: An Introduction to 0x: The Protocol for Trading TokensThe technology driving the 0x project has already resulted in the creation of fully functional decentralized exchanges worth tens of millions of dollars, attesting to the efficacy of the 0x development community.0x project co-founder Will Warren outlines the core goals of the 0x protocol in his Medium blog:“We envision a world in which all forms of value are tokenized on public blockchains. This includes fiat currencies, stocks, bonds, commodities, debt instruments, real estate, video game items, digital collectibles, software licenses, reputation and much more.”Posted In: Basic Attention Token, Zcash, Coinbase, San Francisco, Adoption, Altcoins, Exchanges, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
466,CryptoSlate,Bitcoin Cash Stress Test Results Spark Centralization Concerns,Sam Town,1531738800.0,"A recent “stress test” conducted on the Bitcoin Cash has caused controversy due to the apparently highly centralized nature of the BCH network. Conducted by anonymous developer “Bitpico,” the community-driven stress test purportedly revealed evidence that the Bitcoin Cash network is operating with a significant number of full nodes located on the “same server rack.”The stress test was first announced on June 22, 2018, when Bitpico announced the launch of an attack that would leverage thousands of attack nodes over the course of 6 weeks, stating that 85% of all Bitcoin Cash nodes are located within two data centers:The #bcash $bch @bitcoin attack has been started; it will continue to run as we work to amplify it over the coming months.

Backing down the difficulty right now is a strategy. Wonder why 30% network hash-rate disappeared?  It’s ours; the miners that will continue what is set in motion… A handful of humans cannot stop what they have no control over”Bitpico’s empty threats did nothing to alter the result of the Segwit2x debate, leading many cryptocurrency community members to ignore the results of the developer’s Bitcoin Cash stress test. The evidence gathered by Bitpico during the test, however, echo similar sentiments expressed by Bitcoin developer Nick Szabo.The Case for Bitcoin Cash CentralizationSzabo announced concerns regarding the centralization of the Bitcoin Cash network in December 2017, referring to the network as “centralized sockpuppetry” and retweeting evidence gathered by software architect Sondre Bjellås that 54% of Bitcoin Cash nodes at the time were hosted by Alibaba.""Bitcoin Cash"" is centralized sock puppetry. https://t.co/OJJo5vwEfn— Nick Szabo 🔑 (@NickSzabo4) December 21, 2017In early 2018, Microsoft released a statement highlighting the threat to decentralization presented by block size increases such as those implemented by Bitcoin Cash, with Microsoft Identity Division Director of Program Management Alex Simons stating that layer 2 scaling solutions — such as the Lightning Network — are more effective and less centralized:“While some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity (e.g. blocksize increases), this approach generally degrades the decentralized state of the network and cannot reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale.”Evidence purportedly captured by the Bitpico stress test demonstrated that 98% of all show nodes currently sit on the “same server rack,” which could potentially leave the Bitcoin Cash network highly susceptible to security threats or seizure.98% of the shown nodes are sitting in the same server rack.— ɃitPico (@bitPico) July 9, 2018While the Bitpico stress test may claim that 49% of all Bitcoin Cash nodes are operating on Alibaba facilities, conflicting statistics published by BCHNodes show a fairly even spread between the US and China-based nodes.

467,CryptoSlate,Crypto Unicorn Hunters: The VC Firms Behind Billion-Dollar Crypto Startups,Sam Town,1531641600.0,"The ranks of “unicorn” companies — privately held start-up companies possessing a current valuation of $1 billion USD or more — have been infiltrated by a growing roster of crypto organizations that are dramatically rising in value. While the lineup of crypto unicorns are widely-known, the VC firms backing them are quietly positioning themselves to gain the most from the cryptocurrency revolution.There are currently over 27 fintech unicorns worldwide with crypto platforms such as Robinhood, Revolut, and Coinbase riding a wave of mass adoption and market growth well beyond the billion-dollar mark. Recent data published by finance intelligence platform CB Insights sheds light on the VC firms behind the success of crypto unicorns, and where they’re investing.VC Moves in on Crypto PlatformsCB Insights reveals that cryptocurrency platforms have become highly popular with some of the largest venture capital firms in the world. Coinbase, valued at $1.57 billion, Robinhood, valued at $1.3 billion, and Revolut, valued at $1.7 billion, are the first three crypto startups to reach unicorn status — growth predicted well in advance by forward-leaning VC firms.The three most highly valued crypto startups are present in virtually all of the most dynamic fintech-focused VC firms, with a significant portion of investors entering crypto startups in seed or Series A rounds.Where are Unicorn Hunters Investing?Ribbit Capital, identified as the most active investor in Fintech unicorns, is deeply invested in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, holding bets on Coinbase, Revolut, and Robinhood. Ribbit isn’t only invested in cryptocurrency juggernauts, however. The California-based fund entered into a joint investment fund launched in partnership between Pantera Capital, Fortress, Benchmark Capital and Ribbit Capital in early 2014, creating the Pantera ICO Fund LP Blockchain Investment Fund.Related Story: Crypto Funds Explode in 2018 as Venture Capital Attacks the ICO ModelIn combination with the Pantera Blockchain Investment Fund, Ribbit Capital has backed a broad spectrum of blockchain ventures, including 0x, Abra, Augur, Brave, Bitstamp, Filecoin, OmiseGo, Xapo, and more. Ribbit Capital founder Micky Malka has made several significant bets on blockchain-focused projects since 2011 — speaking at the 2017 Next Big Thing Summit, Malka highlighted the need for disruption within the current financial paradigm:“Money is ripe for disruption. Think about it. Today, it’s easier to make a phone call to anyone around the world for free than it is to send that person $100. It’s easier to buy a $200 smartphone than a $1 app.”CB Insights data highlights London and San Francisco-based VC firm Index Ventures as the fastest-moving fintech unicorn investor, backing both Revolut and Robinhood in Series A rounds, as well as Xapo and Bitpay. Index Ventures Partner Mike Volpi emphasized the long-term strategy of the firm in an interview with TechCrunch:“Bitcoin has gone through a very interesting stage over the last 12 months, where the currency itself went up, then down, then way up again. Now there’s this debate about the length of the blockchain. We still believe in it, but it’s going to be a long journey and we’re generally coaching [our entrepreneurs] to take a long-term view and don’t spend a lot of money and wait for things to settle out.”While Index Ventures is optimistic regarding the future of cryptocurrencies, co-founder Neil Rimer remains skeptical that crypto-based funding solutions such as ICOs are able to replicate every aspect of the VC industry:“Some of these [ICOs] will replace some VCs, and some will replace some [initial public offerings]. But we don’t just allow people to raise money as quickly as possible — we bring a lot of other help and advice, and I think there will continue to be demand for that.”VCs are able to invest in promising blockchain startups with a traditional equity deal, or can alternatively select a “simple agreement for future tokens” model that allows them to cash out in the form of tokens once the startup has launched. This model allows VC investors greater freedom and flexibility in investments, attracting high numbers of VC investors to the crypto market.Ultimately, venture capital interest in the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem is inevitable. VC firms typically find withdrawing from poorly performing investments — an issue solved by innovative investment models that have evolved within the blockchain industry.Posted In: Adoption, Altcoins, Analysis, ICOs     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Noticeably absent from the list is XRP.Today we are announcing that we’re exploring the addition of the following assets to Coinbase: Cardano (ADA), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Zcash (ZEC) and 0x (ZRX). https://t.co/qoECyR0V1f— Coinbase (@coinbase) July 13, 2018When Coinbase listed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in December 2017, the price spiked significantly. As a result, many accused Coinbase of insider trading.In an effort to ensure transparency, Coinbase announced:“We are making this announcement internally at Coinbase and to the public at the same time to remain transparent with our customers about support for future assets.”One can only speculate that Coinbase is making an effort to avoid further allegations of insider trading.Related: Coinbase Announces Ethereum Classic SupportCoinbase noted that these assets will need further exploratory work, and their future listings are not guaranteed.

469,CryptoSlate,EOS Block Producers Crash After RAM Fault,Jonnie Emsley,1531209600.0,"Several block producers of the recently-launched EOS temporarily crashed after running into a RAM-related limitation. The network’s integrity remains unaffected, according to EOS New York.Sounding the alarm on July 7th, 2018, top block producer EOS New York took to Twitter to explain the issue. While withholding the identities of the affected parties, the self-funded producer disclaimed their involvement in the error:Some Block Producers crashed when RAM usage on EOS exceeded 1GB tonight. Either they only had 1GB or they did not configure their node to properly set it at 64GB. This is a violation of the regproducer agreement. EOS New York produced on schedule. We are still confirming details.— EOS New York (@eosnewyork) July 8, 2018According to EOS New York, the issue occurred when the platform’s net RAM consumption exceeded 1GB — temporarily disabling a number of unnamed block producers. Theoretically, EOS block producers can support up to 64GB of RAM capacity collectively.Where faulty hardware may have been responsible, it would appear human error was the root cause — EOS New York explaining the block producers failed to configure their nodes correctly.Initially, EOS New York claimed that the error highlighted a violation of the blockchain’s reproducer agreement — a prospective block producer’s code of conduct. In a subsequent tweet, however, the New York-based outfit took the heat off their previous suggestion:Upon further investigation we learned that this is less a regproducer violation and more a failure to adjust a default configuration on a plugin in their producing node.— EOS New York (@eosnewyork) July 8, 2018Stepping in to substitute the crashed nodes, standby nodes ensured the continued operation of the platform, however.Block Producers and RAM: Conflict of Interest?While this particular incident may have been more bureaucratic than technical in nature, RAM appears to have become a nagging concern for EOS — as an increasingly sparse resource that is integral to the platform’s expansion.Related: Hoarders Drive EOS RAM Market Prices Beyond AffordabilityWhere EOS intends to challenge Ethereum with high-throughput decentralized applications (dApps), it would require large quantities of RAM to offer such performance. During times of heavy usage, that is, RAM becomes a commodity that is crucial to the growth and expansion of the platform’s dApps.The mechanism responsible for maintaining this supply/demand flow is the EOS Dawn 4.0 system —whereby any token holder may ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ memory based on prevailing market prices. While such a speculative system may alone be responsible for creating a scarcity of RAM, the privilege of block producers — who directly control the commodity’s supply — may be equally problematic.Several block producers have recognized such a potential conflict of interest, and maintain they will abstain from trading RAM. EOS New York, for one, writes:“EOS New York will not purchase or sell RAM for speculative purposes. We believe that the resources available on the EOS platform are meant to be used for their utility, not their ability to generate gains. EOS New York will use RAM for development reasons, either for our own projects or the projects of others which we support.”Block producer EOS Nation sees things differently, however. Upon being accused of “insider trading”  by one Reddit user, the community maintained their right to participate in the system, assuring users they would maintain full transparency around their movements.Posted In: EOS, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

The first ten million ONT airdrop on March 8th rewarded users with 0.1 ONT per NEO held. Like the first airdrop, this one will again dispense 0.1 ONT per NEO to holders.Valued at around $4.30 per token, the twenty million ONT dropped represents a total value of $86 million.Related Story: Introduction to Ontology (ONT) – A Distributed Trust Collaboration PlatformJuly 9th is also the beginning of Ontology’s token migration. Although originally built on the NEO network, with the successful launch of the Ontology MainNet, “Ontology 1.0” on July 1st, users must now move their tokens over to Ontology’s blockchain.Other projects that also recently had a token migration include EOS and Tron.Airdropping tokens close to the mainnet launch is an effective way to raise awareness for the project and can also be used for increasing popularity and capital.Sending 0.2 ONT to NEO’s much larger and robust community clearly demonstrates ONT’s hopes of attracting some of the NEO’s community.

At that time, the current REP contract will be frozen indefinitely. The migration will take place over the rest of the day.— Augur (@AugurProject) July 9, 2018Augur looks to disrupt the current prediction markets and solve the issue of communal trust.Augur is based on the principle that you can get a good reading of the probability of an outcome if you incentivize users to use their knowledge. For example, if someone knows with a 90% certainty that it will rain today they will be incentivized up to a point to continue buying shares in the market until it no longer becomes profitable.Through this method, you could get a probability reading by creating a market around a certain event due to the hypothesis that markets are efficient.The purpose of Augur according to the development team:“Augur’s purpose is to democratize and decentralize finance. We’ll do this by enabling anyone, anywhere, at any time in the world to create and speculate on derivatives at a low cost for the first time.”Augur Completes Security Audit and Releases New Bug BountiesIn an update on March 12, 2018, Augur announced the completion of their security audit with Zeppelin – a smart contract security audit business that also performed audits of platforms such as Golem and Basic Attention Token.

472,CryptoSlate,Clothing Company Reveals World’s First Blockchain-Based Traceability System,Avi Felman,1530842400.0,"On July 5th, 2018, in partnership with KALTENDIN, high-end Chinese clothing brand, Waltonchain introduced the WTC-Garment System– the world’s first blockchain-based, clothing authenticity traceability system.Waltonchain is a Chinese based cryptocurrency company focused on creating products in the blockchain + IoT space. Their first initiative combines RFID technology with retail supply chains to improve traceability and data collection. Waltonchain is determined to tackle both the hardware and software components of the IoT industry.In an interview for the Waltonchain blog, the CEO, Mo Bing, said they aim to be “a combination of Qualcomm and Cisco” and,“Data is one example. Data collection may not be charged by the company; instead, it is determined by the user who buys the company’s products. Still, the company can make a profit from hardware, chips and various ‘blockchain +’ smart sensors. In this way, we can become the blockchain industry unicorn.”So, What is WTC-Garment?WTC-Garment is an attempt at disrupting a historically low-tech industry: clothing. There is little application and use of data in this area, mainly because standardized data collection has always been difficult. However, with the introduction of RFID chips on clothing, its now possible to track how often clothes are worn, bought, and handled.Clothing stores will be able to monitor bestsellers, the frequency at which clothing is tried-on, and many other data points to help in creating more effective sales strategies. According to the introductory video released on July 5th, Waltonchain will also be focusing efforts on the implementation of the production, storage, and store management system for Chinese apparel company KALTENDIN.In addition to informing customer interactions, The RFID chips will be key in tracking clothing shipments and ensuring production quality.This is the second major announcement by Waltonchain as in June, they announced the successful completion of R&D for a mid-RFID chip. In partnership with their supplier Silictec, they are now moving into the mass production phase for the proprietary chip.These announcements arrive on the heel of similar developments by a significant supply chain competitor, VeChain, who recently partnered with eight Chinese government organizations to launch a Shanghai Wine and Liquor Blockchain Alliance to track and verify wine quality.It is unclear when WTC-Garment will be fully deployed, but it is the first public blockchain company to develop significant partnerships in the retail space.The value of the WTC token in the network is derived from businesses needing the WTC token to issue and secure side chains where application-specific needs will function. For example, KALTEDIN’s data will be stored on a side chain and in order to store and retrieve data from the side chain, WTC will be required.At press time, WTC is trading at $7.01 up 1.01% against the dollar, but down 85% from its yearly high of $47.30.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Although platforms such as Uphold and eToro exist in offering several asset classes, there is yet to be a service that utilizes blockchain-based peer-to-peer software for both cryptocurrency and traditional asset class trading.Announced on June 5, payments-oriented blockchain Stellar Lumens is launching StellarX – a “universal marketplace” for free peer-to-peer trading.Announcing StellarX! A user-friendly and totally free place to trade on @StellarOrg's universal marketplace. https://t.co/tPNYGY2qe0You trade on-chain. We refund all network fees. Swap crypto, fiat, commodities, whatever. Get an invite here: https://t.co/CVSogvKJGE— StellarX (@stellarxhq) July 5, 2018In an industry-forward mission, StellarX plans to reveal a trading platform based on their distributed ledger technology– coined the Stellar universal order book, to achieve immediate settlement times and commission-free exchange.Stated on the StellarX website:“Transactions settle in seconds, and trading on StellarX costs nothing. We refund your network fees and we even return Stellar’s automatic 1% APR inflation to our users, keeping none of the weekly airdrops for ourselves.”The platform confirms that cryptocurrency, fiat, bonds, and commodities will be available for trading and ensures security of asset ownership through a wallet that is controlled solely by the user.“StellarX is built on Stellar’s universal order book. Trades happen directly between traders. No middlemen, no miners. You trade from your own wallet and keep total control of your keys.”To ensure initial and consistent liquidity, StellarX also mentioned that market maker rewards in the form of 100k XLM will be distributed to top market makers on a weekly basis.In the midst of emerging security token exchanges, StellarX joins a new consortium of nascent asset marketplaces. StellarX is yet to release a public launch date but plans to release the platform in the summer of 2018.

474,CryptoSlate,Kingdom of Thailand Publishes New ICO Legalization Framework,Sam Town,1530842400.0,"The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission officially announced the upcoming launch of a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), scheduled to come into effect July 16, 2018. The pro-crypto Southeast Asian nation recently announced the legalization of domestic cryptocurrency markets with two royal decrees earlier this year.In an announcement published on Wednesday, Thailand’s SEC released information on the new ICO guidelines, which will see the kingdom become one of the first countries worldwide to allow the launch of domestic ICOs in a completely regulated environment.Thai SEC Moves to Support Domestic ICOsThe Thai SEC’s statement unequivocally outlines the Thai government stance on ICOs, stating that the SEC “supports the issuance and offering of digital tokens via ICO.” The launch and operation of initial coin offerings within Thailand will be governed by the Digital Asset Management Act of BE 2561 from July 16, 2018, and will require prospective ICOs to pass a screening process.ICOs operating within Thailand must be submitted by a Thai company with a registered capital of no less than 5 million Baht ($150,000 USD) and will be screened by an SEC ICO portal to evaluate the business plan and distribution structure of tokens. Interestingly, the SEC’s ICO portal will also audit project code repositories.The Thai ICO legalization framework also takes institutional and venture capital participation in the initial coin offering ecosystem into account, limiting the total amount sold to retail investors to 4 times that of shareholders’ equity or not more than 70% of the total offering value.Related Article: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin Among 7 Cryptocurrencies Now Legal in ThailandWhile ICOs will be legal in Thailand under the Digital Asset Management Act, organizations operating ICOs will be limited in the remittance methods used to sell tokens during crowd sales. ICO issuers are able to receive only Thai baht, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, XRP, or Stellar Lumens.Securities and Exchange Commission Secretary-General Rapee Sucharitakul commented on the new regulatory framework, highlighting the importance of investor due diligence when investing in ICOs:“The SEC’s criteria will help set the standard for ICOs and enhance the screening process in order to protect investors from being deceived. SEC licensing for digital token offerings, however, does not guarantee the success of a fundraising project … investors should study the information thoroughly and in order to be sure they can accept the risk involved before investing.”The Thai government holds a progressive stance toward cryptocurrency regulation, making the country fertile ground for promising blockchain ventures — notably, Bangkok-based OmiseGO, which is currently the 20th most successful blockchain venture by market cap.Posted In: Thailand, Adoption, Altcoins, Regulation     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
475,CryptoSlate,Hoarders Drive EOS RAM Market Prices Beyond Affordability,Jonathan Kim,1530666000.0,"Little-known to the average investor, data markets hold tremendous value for both developers and traders. The EOS RAM market – selling memory space to developers – is seeing a spike in price per megabyte due to centralized ownership.Intro to the EOS RAM MarketIn order to distribute RAM across the EOS network, the EOSIO Dawn 4.0 mainnet uses an updated market-based allocation approach allowing token holders to buy and sell database space at prevailing market prices.Decentralized applications require a significant amount of memory space to store temporary data for their programs, which developers can purchase with EOS on the EOS RAM market.Although an innovative solution to RAM distribution, the market-based approach leaves the allocation of RAM susceptible to shortages and price inflation.In the blog post announcing EOSIO Dawn 4.0, CTO Daniel Larimer wrote:“Under the Dawn 3.0 system contract, you could only sell RAM for the price you paid. The goal was to disincentivize hoarding and speculation.As stated, the previous version of the RAM market used a fixed price mechanism to prevent hoarding and speculation in the marketplace. Alternatively, the updated RAM market lets trades fluctuate the value of RAM on the network.“Under Dawn 4.0 the system contract now buys and sells RAM allocations at prevailing market prices. This may result in traders buying RAM today in anticipation of potential shortages tomorrow.”Whales Corner the MarketIt’s becoming evident the new market-based approach enables speculators to profit from hoarding RAM – removing the incentive to leave database space available for developer use and causing the price per MB to rise rapidly.An EOS community member, @ferdousbhai, took to Twitter to share the increasing scarcity of RAM on the EOS network:When buying RAM, you are trading against Bancor algo. The algo is fed $EOS from all people that bought RAM before you.The algo doesn’t care how high the price is and will pay literally anything until people start giving back the RAM.At 99% utilization, 1KB RAM costs 147 EOS. pic.twitter.com/atv2mdGyDj— Ferdous ฿hai (@ferdousbhai) July 3, 2018With over 85% of available RAM being kept by select individuals, the demand for the scarce developer resource is driving prices beyond affordability. At the current rate, the cost of 1 MB of RAM is approximately 715 EOS (~$6455 USD).Given that there are no applications currently running on the EOS platform, it makes little sense why 85% of the available RAM has already been claimed for use. The reason? Speculators are hoarding RAM in anticipation of rising demand and price.Source: marketstackdAs a solution to RAM hoarding, the EOS community has proposed block producers confiscate utilized RAM from hoarders who intend to profit rather than allocate data space for developer use. Alternatively, the EOS network could increase the available capacity of RAM on the platform.An EOS blog post mentions that through Moore’s Law – a prediction that computation power will double every two years – the network’s supply of RAM will eventually increase to 4TB.“Over time Moore’s law will allow block producers to upgrade to 4TB or even 16TB of RAM and this increase in supply will trickle into the the EOSIO RAM market lowering prices.”However, this upgrade to RAM capacity requires a two-thirds or greater vote by the 21 block producers governing the EOS network – leaving the future of the RAM market in the hands of a centralized body who may or may not own RAM themselves.RAM traders and speculators hoarding their RAM holdings in a market shortage have little incentive to free up memory space for developer use, creating an unanticipated obstruction to DApp development on the EOS platform and a price per MB that will continue to rise towards infinity.As stated in the EOS blog post announcing EOSIO Dawn 4.0:“As RAM is reserved the price will automatically increase so that the price approaches infinity before the system runs out of RAM.”Unless resolved, the development of dApps on the EOS network may soon become too expensive. What the EOS community and block producers decide as a solution to the RAM market shortage has yet to be uncovered.Posted In: EOS, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
476,CryptoSlate,More than 600 Cryptocurrencies Dead as Bitcoin Approaches 75% Retracement,Jonnie Emsley,1530608400.0,"In the wake of Bitcoin’s hearty correction, there are now more than 600 cryptocurrencies that have been erased from the marketplace.According to Dead Coins, approximately 635 cryptocurrency projects have failed to maintain nodes, been abandoned by developers, scammed, or hacked — any one of the criteria landing the coin in the website’s “deceased” category.To this effect, in theory one in three ICOs are now destined for failure — with 1602 active cryptocurrencies listed on CryptoSlate as of July 3rd 2018.Coupled with a market-wide retracement, the market’s expanding graveyard appears not to have dissuaded Initial Coin Offering (ICO) investment, however. With 539 ICOs raising nearly $12 billion, the first six months of 2018 have more than doubled the entirety of 2017’s $5.6 billion ICO contributions.Buyer Beware?In the face of a feverous investment landscape, a number of high-profile establishments are appealing for prospective ICO investors to maintain vigilance.In May, the Wall Street Journal reported 271 of 1450 ICOs reviewed as having “red flags” — projects incorporating plagiarized material, guaranteed return on investment, or “fraudulent tactics to lure investors”. While more these suspect offerings received more than $1 billion  from investors, losses totalling $273 million have been reported to lawsuits and legal proceedings.Smack bang in the middle of New York Blockchain Week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched HoweyCoins — a bogus ICO site incorporating all of the classical “flags”. While seasoned cryptocurrency advocates may cringe at the site’s claims — such as holding a “pre-planned pump” — the SEC’s message appears to have been picked up by a wider audience. A regular commentator on US finance law, attorney Frost tweeted:HoweyCoin—Too Good To Be True . #VirtualCurrency #HoweyCoin #SEC #ICO #InitialCoinOffering #MaryLundstedt #frostandassociates #taxattorney https://t.co/mHCDMNKbjP— Frost & Associates (@IRSTaxIssues) June 26, 2018Not all flagged projects are illegitimate, however. DADI, for one, has remained on the market since February after sidestepping an admission of plagiarism. Weeks before the decentralized cloud computing platform’s ICO, the project ruffled feathers when one prospective contributor discovered parts of the DADI whitepaper had been copied from its closest competitor — SONM. Thrown in with an accusation of a false partnership with Nano, DADI nevertheless concluded a successful $29,000,000 raise on the 29th of January.Highlighting the order of events, one Twitter user commented:Red Flags DADI – Think buy or not!1. It appears as though some of DADI’s whitepaper has been directly copied from SONM’s whitepaper.2. DADI had claimed a partnership with XRB. XRB have come out publicly and said this is NOT the case.#redflag @dadi #SCAM #ICO #criptocurrency— @Андрей Колмогоров (@CriptoActive) January 29, 2018All questions of legitimacy aside, ICOs would appear to remain a wholly lucrative venture. Should an individual have invested into every one of 2017’s 435 ICOs — including failed projects — their net holdings would be up 1320%. In an increasingly regulated ICO market, one might see the eradication of failed coins as a necessary culling — perhaps akin to the dotcom bubble.Posted In: Bitcoin, Altcoins, ICOs     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

You can’t, Ethereum doesn’t support any of these languages. They can’t even run a single viral app on the platform. If you look at the top 10 languages, none of them works on the system, so, by definition, all those developers aren’t developing for the system, they have to go and learn new tools and new stuff. With Cardano, first off, we’re backward-compatible, 100%, we’re running an EVM.”It’s evident that the Cardano blockchain was built with developers in mind, as the platform will enable compatibility to several popular coding languages for the writing of smart contracts and decentralized applications on the platform.With Cardano’s KEVM testnet currently active, Googlers were curious to know which milestones Cardano plans to reach this year in the early stages of its next-gen blockchain development:“Our goal is to release the next major version of Cardano some time this year, called Shelly. We are working really hard towards that. It might slip, but the odds are that it won’t… In parallel, we are releasing testnets for smart contracts. The first one will be released at the end of the month, and this is done with something called the KEVM.”Although a partnership was not discussed, it’s worth noting that Google, a site that currently bans cryptocurrency ads, is taking interest in a specific blockchain project. Whether the two organizations will collaborate on the development of blockchain-related technology is yet to be uncovered.Posted In: Cardano, U.K., Adoption, Altcoins, Privacy, Rumors     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

479,CryptoSlate,Burst Dymaxion – The Linux of Blockchain,Jonathan Kim,1530497460.0,"While several emerging smart contract platforms make only slight revisions to derivative blockchains, Burst combines several unique features and mechanisms to bring users a truly distinct distributed ledger experience.In an effort to unite the best of both worlds, Burst uses a main blockchain with customizable, IOTA-like tangles built upon it. The unique integration of both decentralized systems, along with privacy features from other blockchains, allows Burst to overcome the common issues of energy efficiency, scalability, and speed.Written in the Burst Dymaxion whitepaper, it states:“The original Burstcoin blockchain is used as underlying layer to open and close an arbitrary number of general purpose transaction channels, similar to the Lightning Network proposal of Bitcoin, but using IOTA-like tangles for propagation and verification… This concept takes the best traits of the original Burstcoin, IOTA, Monero, ZCash and the newest Bitcoin proposals to create a currency suitable for truly global use.”A Unique Proof-of-Capacity EmphasisLaunched in 2014, Burst is a unique blockchain platform using the PoC consensus mechanism.Using a Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) consensus mechanism, Burst enables users to sidestep additional costs and contribute computing power directly through their hard drives – acting as the only blockchain to enable HDD mining.Burst Community Figure, Tom Créance told CryptoSlate why Burst chose PoC over more common mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS):“PoW is not only energy consuming, it is also causing of a lot of heat and noise, it needs specialized, non-reusable hardware, and it leads to centralization of the mining process. A PoS system is inegalitarian in two areas: initial distribution and mining reward. Initial distribution is made through ICOs, crowdsales, airdrops or similar processes. As a result, distribution happens in a short period of time and concentrates the majority of coins in the hands of a minority.”By using data chunks called plots, the Burst network is able to achieve mining at a consumption rate of only 0.0024 kWh per transaction compared to the 1037 kWh used to process a single Bitcoin transaction.The use of PoC also allows users equal contribution power on the network and puts emphasis on true decentralization, since users aren’t influential based on ownership of coins or total network contribution.Tangle-Driven Infinite TPSThe Burst Dymaxion works by integrating the Burst blockchain as a base layer for toggling the tangles built upon it – allowing for an infinite number of independent P2P payment channels to actively operate separately from the main chain.Tangles can be customized by network size and validation requirements and exist temporarily or permanently for specific entities utilizing the Burst network, such as banks, financial exchanges, and other payment-oriented institutes.Through the use of independent, arbitrarily scalable tangles, Burst aims to achieve an infinite TPS. Explaining the Dymaxion structure, Créance told CryptoSlate: “With the Dymaxion, the Burst blockchain will become the backbone of a lightning network of colored Tangles… The Burst network will be able to handle hundreds of thousands of such scalable payment channels opened simultaneously, hence supporting a potentially infinite number of transactions per second.”In addition to IOTA tangles, Burst utilizes Zcash’s zk-SNARK technology and Monero’s ring signatures to allow users a transaction concealment option upon creating a tangle. Although absent from the main chain, the use of zk-SNARK and ring signatures can enable users to operate a P2P payment channel anonymously if chosen to do so.Burst aims to achieve its ultimate version of the Dymaxion through three hard forks – the first of which took place on June 11th, 2018. The Burst Dymaxion will be fully enabled with the second fork. The third hard fork will enable PoC3, an update to its consensus mechanism that will allow mining on important data, assuring it remains intact and accessible for future generations.For more information on Burstcoin, check out the Burst coin profile or visit their website.Posted In: Altcoins, Privacy, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
480,CryptoSlate,Kraken Fires Back at “Journalist Lemmings” for Tether Manipulation Accusations,Sam Town,1530504000.0,"A recent investigation into Tether activity on popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken triggered scathing responses from the exchange, who fired back at journalists that, according to Kraken, fail to understand market basics.Related Story: Tether Exchange Vulnerability Raises Security Concerns, New Research Suggests USDT Wash Trading on Kraken“On Tether: Journalists Defy Logic, Raising Red Flags,” published July 1, 2018, appears to have been issued as a direct response to a recent Bloomberg investigation claiming several patterns identified by a Bloomberg research team were indicative of wash trading or other less-than-scrupulous exchange practices.The Kraken team took to the exchange blog to post a damning retort to the research published by the news platform, highlighting the fact that the investigation performed overlooks several key factors:“ … a recent article in which a reporter covering market structure for Bloomberg News inexplicably fails to comprehend basic market concepts such as arbitrage, order books and currency pegs.  More troubling, however, was the applause from other “journalist” lemmings as they followed in walking their reputations off a cliff. It defies logic.”Bloomberg Doesn’t Appear to Understand StablecoinsOne of the primary points raised within the Bloomberg study — the apparent unnatural stability of USDT — is the focus of a significant portion of Kraken’s response, which takes the time to explain to less technically adept market observers that USDT does not experience the same level of volatility because it is collateralized with $1 US dollar.“If an order book is too hard a concept to grasp, think about stock at your grocery store.  Why doesn’t the price on avocados change every time you put one in your basket?”Kraken’s response also dismantles accusations of market manipulation, stating that the exchange strives to operate an open and fair platform to all users and would never jeopardize our reputation by engaging in or supporting manipulation:“After reading the Bloomberg article, we scratched our heads, questioning just what type of manipulation was being claimed. Price manipulation?  Is it so hard to believe that an asset-backed stablecoin could trade, well… with so much stability?”Kraken also notes the recent increase in USDT supply, which “appears reasonable” given fiat currency inflows to the platform between January 2017 and April 2018.The key driver behind Bloomberg’s accusations of market manipulation is the presence of orders possessing multiple decimal places — a data point that, according to experts consulted by the news platform, is “indicative of wash trading.” Kraken, however, provided succinct insight into the reasoning behind such orders:“Oh, and we asked the botter responsible for the mysterious 13076.389 orders.  The answer: “literally randomly selected”. So, there you have it.”Kraken CEO Burns Bloomberg Reporter Live on TwitterKraken co-founder and CEO Jesse Powell took to Twitter to voice his disappointment with the level of journalistic intelligence present within the crypto news cycle subsequent to the event.The market for intelligent reporting in crypto hit an all-time low today on @Bloomberg. https://t.co/XDOpzLaoiH. @cryptoscopia slays: https://t.co/Hfy7rM4dVv— Jesse Powell (@jespow) June 29, 2018The tweet quickly captured a response from Bloomberg investigation author Matthew Leising, who questioned the Kraken founder on his apparent failure to reply to queries during the composition of the article.

481,CryptoSlate,"Tether Exchange Vulnerability Raises Security Concerns, New Research Suggests USDT Wash Trading on Kraken",Sam Town,1530414000.0,"This week, US-Dollar pegged stablecoin Tether once again captured cryptocurrency community attention for the wrong reasons with poorly-implemented Tether exchange integration resulting in the successful execution of a double spend.Tether’s tenuous relationship with the cryptocurrency market has been further stressed by an in-depth investigation into USDT movement on Kraken that experts labeled as “indicative of wash trading.”Concern regarding the integrity of Tether code was sparked on June 28, 2018, when Chinese blockchain cybersecurity  company SlowMist posted a tweet evidencing a potential security vulnerability exploit used to execute a double spend:交易所在进行USDT充值交易确认是否成功时存在逻辑缺陷，未校验区块链上交易详情中valid字段值是否为true，导致“假充值”，用户未损失任何USDT却成功向交易所充值了USDT，而且这些 USDT 可以正常进行交易。我们已经确认真实攻击发生！相关交易所应尽快暂停USDT充值功能，并自查代码是否存在该逻辑缺陷。 pic.twitter.com/EPzZIsZFzH— SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) June 28, 2018Translated, the tweet reveals that by sending a transaction to an unnamed exchange without entering correct field values on a transaction, a user was able to successfully execute a double spend. JR Willett, the founder of OmniLayer — the platform upon which Tether was built — commented on the exploit via Reddit, providing an explanation of the vulnerability:“It appears that what happened here is that an exchange wasn’t checking the valid flag on transactions. They accepted a transaction with valid=false (which they should not have), and then the second “double spend” transaction had valid=true, which they also accepted.”The double spend, according to Willett, occurred not due to a flaw in the Tether code, but instead with the exchange itself, which failed to integrate Tether in a secure manner:“Unless I am missing something, this is just poor exchange integration.”Tether Releases Statement, Exchanges RespondTether was quick to assuage fears that the code that drives the USDT token secure, taking to Twitter to post an update denying culpability for the exploit:Yesterday's #USDT issue was related to the implementation logic of a specific exchange and not with either Tether or the OMNI Protocol.Please refer to the following guide for OMNI core integration best practises: https://t.co/SSgKBGrIeL https://t.co/TJZLrFP9ZI— Tether (@Tether_to) June 29, 2018OKEx issued a public statement subsequent to the SlowMist announcement, notifying users that the exchange is aware of the loophole and is not exposed, shedding light on the method through which the exploit is executed:“When a digital asset exchange is processing a USDT deposit, it may fail to verify if the validity of the transaction is “true”. So, a user’s account can be credited with USDT, even if the deposit failed, and the user will be able to trade with the tokens credited.”New Analysis Hints Toward Suspicious USDT ActivityWhile the small-scale double spend controversy appears to stem from a minor exchange implementation issue, a new study released by Bloomberg on Tether trading activity on popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken may have far more serious implications.Published via Bloomberg by a group of analysts on June 29, the analysis examined Kraken order book data that consisted of 56,000 trades between May 1 and June 22, revealing several data points that market experts have highlighted as potentially indicative of wash trading.Related: The Final Frontier of Crypto Decentralization: DEXs and The Liquidity ProblemThe impact of wash trading and unscrupulous liquidity management techniques within the cryptocurrency market is a pressing issue in the current crypto ecosystem. The Bloomberg study, performed with assistance from New York University Professor Rosa Abrantes-Metz and former Federal Reserve bank examiner Mark Williams, found several “red flags” associated with market manipulation.Strangely specific order sizes extending to over 5 decimal places occurred frequently within the dataset examined by the investigative team, a factor that causes Abrantes-Metz and Williams to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs — triggering automated wash trading.Williams commented on the suspicious nature of transactions expressing a fifth decimal point:“Many of the trade amounts are frequently occurring to the fifth decimal point, a unique identifier which increases the probability it is being generated by the same person or entity,”The University of Texas Professor John Griffin, who published a study on USDT-assisted Bitcoin price manipulation that shook the cryptocurrency market last month stated that the data provided by the study was “suggestive of wash trading” in an interview with Bloomberg:“Not sure what the motivation is. The more I looked into it, the more sketchy it seemed … No human would enter that order. It doesn’t make sense.”Kraken Chief Executive Officer Jesse Powell, however, denies that the exchange has any involvement with Tether-related market manipulation in a statement issued to Bloomberg:“Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed.”Posted In: Tether, Altcoins, Analysis, Exchanges, Stablecoins, Trading     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
482,CryptoSlate,Block.one Officially Proposes EOS Constitution Overhaul,Sam Town,1530406800.0,"The ongoing issue of EOS governance is rapidly growing into a decisive crisis that could see the entire EOS constitution entirely rewritten. Stemming from a missed block producer meeting, the complex three-party EOS governance structure debate could potentially be solved by a new constitution proposed by EOS developer Block.one.The EOS blockchain allows community members to interact with and guide the EOS project in a democratic manner, with a governance structure described as a “holistic blueprint for a globally scalable blockchain society.” The EOS constitution is the cornerstone of the EOS project, and functions as a “multi-party contract entered into by the Members by virtue of their use of this blockchain.”Related: EOS Governance Divides Crypto CommunityThe current state of the EOS constitution, however, caused significant controversy within the blockchain ecosystem, with EOS CTO Dan Larimer — the creator of the constitution — proposing a complete constitutional overhaul via Telegram earlier this week.Larimer’s proposition appears to have taken root within Block.One, who subsequently published an official proposal for an “EOS Constitution v2.0” that resembles a clarified edit of Larimer’s proposed EOS constitution referendum Medium post.EOS Constitution v2.0 Would See The End of Protocol-Level Arbitration OrdersBlock.one’s constitution overhaul proposition expands on Larimer’s perspective of law defined by the “intent of code,” relying on block producers to function as a jury:“Block.one suggests ending all protocol-level arbitration orders other than to render non-binding opinions on the intent of the code. We believe the elected block producers should be the jury, and must render a 2/3+1 decision to alter a broken contract.”Interestingly, the Block.one proposal establishes a clear stance on transactions accepted to the blockchain, stating that enabling a fall back to arbitration to dispute the validity of a signature after the fact opens up more issues than it solves. The issue of lost and stolen keys, states the proposal, will be solved by native EOS Apple Secure Enclave, Touch ID, Face ID, and time delay integration.Wallet Security Will Eliminate Stolen KeysThe proposed constitutional update could streamline the relationship between ETAC, the element of the EOS governance structure that handles arbitration orders, and block producers. Roshan Abraham, the head of technology at block producer EOS Authority, commented on the proposition:“The major change is limiting arbitration orders to fixing errors in the code and not dealing with arbitration for stolen funds. With EOS, the “intent of code is law” rather than “code is law”Abraham notes the changing relationship between the ETAC and block producers, highlighting the recent controversy regarding EosStore’s failure to comply with an ECAF emergency measure of a protection order“The block producers have a new telegram group and other private channels to be alerted of such notices. However, I don’t see account freezes happening once the new constitution is in place. Arbitration ruling will be only for emergency code changes.”The first step in protecting the EOS community from both stolen keys and governance overreach, states Abraham, is the creation of a secure wallet solution that integrates virtually impenetrable security features. The first wave of EOS secure wallets, soon to be released on iOS, operates in a similar manner to a hardware wallet, retaining private keys within a secure enclave native to iOS:“Block.One is also expected to roll out a much more secure enclave iOS wallet which will make it easy (to integrate) unique EOS security features like time delay (and) active / owner key systems, along with multiple account signature. The current problems we have with stolen keys are in the import process from Ethereum where only one EOS key was set!”   EOS 7 Nov at 2:27 am UTC$8.04  0.31%EOS, currently ranked #5 by market cap, is up 0.31% over the past 24 hours.

The launch marks the transition of VEN tokens from the ERC-20 standard to wholly unique tokens on their own blockchain as VET tokens, a move already endorsed by major exchanges.The launch of the VeChain Thor mainnet follows the release of the project’s new development plan and whitepaper in May, with the distributed ledger-based product ID and supply chain initiative releasing details on governance, partnerships, and initial coin offerings on the new blockchain.At exactly 08:00:09 the first block was successfully mined. The VeChainThor Blockchain has officially launched. pic.twitter.com/aYZs19GoAO— VeChain Foundation (@vechainofficial) June 30, 2018Successful Alpha Culminates in Mainnet LaunchThe VeChain alpha test, which concluded late June, saw a team of over 100 third-party security expert and auditors assess the VeChain code ahead of mainnet launch. The new VeChain mainnet aims to address the obstacles that stand between enterprise organizations and large-scale blockchain adoption, allowing big business to access the benefits of distributed ledger solutions without the attendant development cost.VeChain founder and former CIO of Louis Vuitton China published a farewell tweet to Ethereum subsequent to the mining of the VeChain Thor genesis block:Salute & Respect, Ethereum where we start from but are marching to the new world! Thank you @VitalikButerin and entire ETH team and community #VeChainThor #GenesisBlock pic.twitter.com/6cB7pXVKCU— Sunny “No-Any-Promotion-Link” LU (@sunshinelu24) June 30, 2018The launch of the VeChain mainnet marks the entrance of a new blockchain solution geared towards enterprise organizations that rival those offered by platforms such as IBM-backed Hyperledger or the community-driven Ethereum Enterprise Alliance.Related: VeChain Partners with Safe Haven for Digital LegaciesVeChain, instead of using a single token that simultaneously functions as both a store of value and a utility token, establishes a two-token system. Token functionality is split between store of value, with VET tokens, and blockchain use cost, with VeThor tokens.The VeChain platform also uses a novel consensus method called “Proof of Authority.” In an explanation of the apotheosis of the VeChain project, the VeChain Foundation defines the underlying philosophy of the consensus method that drives VeChain Thor:“Neither a total centralization nor a total decentralization would be the correct answer, but a comprise and balance of both would.”Related: VeChain Reveals New Development Plan and Whitepaper, Announces First ICO on VeChainThorTo achieve a balance between centralization and decentralization that delivers the benefits of distributed ledger technology to businesses while still providing control and security, VeChain uses a hybridized consensus model that resembles Proof of Stake.Proof of Authority, however, requires that all nodes be approved and validated by a trusted central party, referring to them as authority master nodes.The VeChain Proof of Authority consensus model is defined by low computational power requirements, no requirement of communications between nodes to achieve consensus, and system continuity independent of the number of available nodes.VeChain Mobile Wallet One Week Away, Exchanges Announce SupportThe VeChain mobile wallet is set to become available on July 9, allowing VeChain token holders to obtain full control over VeChain assets. The new wallet app will also herald the launch of the new X-node monitor system and integration with the Ledger hardware wallet.Please view our VeChainThor Wallet Manual. This manual provides instructions for token swaps and X Node migration.The final X Node snapshot of the Ethereum chain is taking place in 20 mins.

Interestingly, the VeChain Thor mainnnet launch could see VeChain become one of the most profitable projects for node operators — should VET reach $1.66 after the 1:100 split, the smallest tier of X node will be worth $1 million USD.Posted In: VeChain, China, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
484,CryptoSlate,High Fidelity to Create New Virtual World on EOS Blockchain,Jonathan Kim,1530349200.0,"Blockchain and virtual reality are arguably two of the most innovative inventions of this generation. Bringing the future to the present day, VR platform High Fidelity is creating a new virtual world powered by the EOS blockchain.Backed by Billionaire Mike NovogratzOne of the earliest institutional investors to become a Bitcoin bull, Mike Novogratz and his Galaxy EOS Ecosystem Fund led a series D fundraising round for the High Fidelity platform with a $20 million investment, along with contributions from Breyer Capital, Blockchain Capital, Vulcan Capital, and IDG Capital Partners.Related Story: Mike Novogratz and Bloomberg Team Up to Create the First Institutional-Grade Benchmark for Crypto MarketCurrently in beta, the High Fidelity platform aims to use an EOS-based blockchain to support billions of potential VR users in a universe of virtual reality worlds, coined the Metaverse.In an interview with Reuters, CEO at High Fidelity Philip Rosedale said:“To reach this scale and to deliver safely on such a promise, VR must be decentralized, including deeply using blockchain technology.”High Fidelity has already developed a native cryptocurrency for its popular VR game, Second Life, using the Linden dollars (L$) as a medium of exchange to purchase goods and services within the virtual world.To date, Linden dollars have produced over $4 billion in virtual transactions globally and can be traded for USD on the LindeX exchange.CEO at High Fidelity Philip Rosedale, said in an interview:“If bitcoin had been around in 2005, I would have been delighted to use it for Second Life.”High Fidelity Coin – Intro to the Virtual World EconomyFounded in 2013, High Fidelity Inc is a social virtual reality company and developer of Second Life.For the new High Fidelity platform, Rosedale plans to issue a new stablecoin on the EOS network, called High Fidelity coin, with a 1:1 parity to the US Dollar.In the new virtual Metaverse, users will be able to use High Fidelity coin to purchase goods and services licensed by real-world merchants.Each transaction will be recorded on the EOS blockchain for merchants to verify.Sam Englebardt, High Fidelity board member and Head of Strategic Partnerships at Galaxy Digital, told Reuters:“Virtual reality may be the first killer app for blockchain. It’s a global phenomenon that fundamentally requires a trustless consensus mechanism for currency, property and identity.”Rosedale confirmed that High Fidelity raised over $70 million so far for the new project’s research and development, staff, and new offices in Seattle, WA.Posted In: EOS, Seattle, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
485,CryptoSlate,"Coinbase, Peter Thiel Back New ‘Reserve’ Stablecoin",Jonathan Kim,1530319800.0,"With the rise in popular interest, the cryptocurrency sector has seen several stablecoins emerge in decentralized and centralized forms. Backed by Coinbase and Peter Thiel, Reserve stablecoin is the latest addition to the digital asset marketplace.A Next-Gen StablecoinBased in San Fransisco, Reserve stablecoin raised $5 million in its seed round from over 40 funds and angel investors, including PayPal founder Peter Thiel, Coinbase Exchange, GSR.IO and Distributed Global.Unlike Tether and TrueUSD, Reserve uses a fully decentralized, future growth-backed stablecoin model to achieve a 1:1 parity with the US Dollar.The Reserve protocol will be open source at launch and use a smart contract called Vault to securely store its cryptocurrency collateral.Using both external digital assets and internal shares to offer stability, Reserve places an emphasis on transparency through decentralization.In a company blog post, Reserve Co-founder Nevin Freeman said:“If a future growth-backed stablecoin does reach this state of stable equilibrium, it has the benefit of being totally decentralized and thus censorship resistant.”Although transparent, the use of a decentralized model and hence external backing by digital assets is inherently difficult to sustain, as the assets backing a stable currency are volatile. Reserve must maintain collateral balances at two to three times the parity value to compensate for future price variation.In an interview with CCN, Freeman noted:“There is still a tail-risk that in a black swan event these assets could lose nearly all of their value, and that’s why we aim to create a diversified pool through securitized assets.”Stablecoins: Gateway to Crypto Mass AdoptionThe 20-member team behind the Reserve protocol includes engineers from Google, OpenAI, and former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. With current cryptocurrencies being too volatile for use in daily transactions, many believe the introduction of a successful stablecoin will be the beginning of mass adoption.Freeman wrote in a blog post released June 19:“I believe stable cryptocurrencies will be the first introduction to crypto for millions or billions of people.”Several stablecoins are competing to overtake the controversial Tether and become the leading stablecoin for global frictionless value exchange, everyday payments, and more.Related: Circle Raises $110M to Create “USDC” Ethereum-Compatible StablecoinSeattle-based Stably raised $500k in early April 2018 and uses a centralized stablecoin model backed by a fiat reserve to maintain its “organic price stability.”In mid-May, Circle raised $110 million in seed funding from Chinese mining giant Bitmain and others to develop its own Circle USDC stablecoin set to launch this summer.Posted In: Coinbase, San Francisco, Adoption, Altcoins, Stablecoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

With over 85 million daily visitors, Pornhub is currently ranked 13 across all website categories in the world! pic.twitter.com/9VlJm43Fnn— Tron Foundation (@Tronfoundation) June 27, 2018Despite its June 24, 2018, mainnet launch, TRON’s recent price action has been relatively stagnant. The June 27 announcement, however, seemed to spur on an hour-long buy rally.After the addition of privacy coin Verge in April 2018, Pornhub’s latest move will see a total of three cryptocurrencies accepted on the pornography site — which experienced 28.5 billion visits in 2017. TRX and ZEN will also be payment methods acceptable for Pornhub purchases and streaming, in addition to the site’s traffic and advertising network.The coin trio will also be accepted on 13 additional adult-oriented sites owned by MindGeek — the parent company of Pornhub.Citing the need to adhere to the “growing payment preferences” of its customers and community members, Pornhub Vice President Corey Price pointed to the advantages of cryptocurrencies over fiat:“Decentralized payment systems have continued to grow in popularity, and cryptocurrency adoption is exploding across a broad economic spectrum. Today, cryptocurrencies are especially viable in the adult entertainment industry because they are privacy-centric and incorporate more anonymity tools than traditional tender.”Pornhub may recognize the suitability of cryptocurrency for enabling privacy for users, yet the selection of TRON may puzzle some. Where ZenCash and Verge may be held up as privacy coins — which typically mask transaction data and addresses — TRON has not yet implemented any method to make transactions private.TRON: Spreading its Wings?Related: TRON Founder Justin Sun Set to Acquire µTorrent, BitTorrent, Inc.Having recently acquired BitTorrent, TRON founder Justin Sun appears to be casting a wide net for TRX usage.

487,CryptoSlate,Dan Larimer Proposes Revised Draft of EOS Constitution,Jonathan Kim,1530144000.0,"From its turbulent mainnet launch, the EOS network faced community backlash for freezing several user accounts. On June 26, 2018, EOS CTO Dan Larimer took to Telegram to propose a complete rehaul of the network’s constitution.Controversy With Current EOS Governance ModelDan Larimer, CTO of EOS and Co-founder of SteemitOn June 26, CTO of EOS and an original drafter of its constitution, Dan Larimer joined the EOS community on Telegram to propose a revised network governance model.Without permission from the majority of token holders, the EOS network’s 21 block producers froze seven accounts on June 17 – using the EOS911 Initiative to justify their executive decision and breach the blockchain’s immutability.Stating that the current state of the constitution is too centralized in its allocation of power to arbitrators, Larimer wrote:“I am merely saying that the current constitution is not wise… I don’t think unlimited power to arbs is [a] good idea. This governance process is [a] slippery slope and must maintain highest standards to keep community trust. Checks and balances and consent [are] required.”The three groups that comprise the EOS community are the arbitrators (EOS Core Arbitration Forum), 21 Block Producers (BPs), and token-holders.Larimer expressed that EOS arbitrator’s authority should extend only into disputes regarding the intent of code, not the overseeing of users’ assets.Given Larimer’s shared opinions, it was evident that the EOS CTO effectively suggested the complete rehaul of the network’s constitution to re-balance community autonomy with block producers’ and arbitrators’ governing powers.Dogecoin creator, Jackson Palmer took to Twitter to delineate Larimer’s comments:What a surprise that just 2 weeks after launching, #EOS is considering scrapping its entire “constitution” and starting over. (Source: https://t.co/z5abgMhyPP) pic.twitter.com/cYoH7w93zL— Jackson Palmer (@ummjackson) June 27, 2018New Constitution DraftedOn June 27, Dan Larimer’s blog post outlined the framework for his newly revised EOS constitution – stating boundaries limiting the authority of arbitrators and block producers on the network.“If there is a dispute on intent of code, then intent shall be determined by a super majority vote of elected producers or an arbiter mutually agreed to by the parties to the dispute and enacted by producers… At no time shall elected block producers freeze or modify contracts that are operating as intended.”Addressing the need to safeguard users from being robbed of their private keys and cases involving such circumstances, Larimer suggested an optional arbitration smart contract:“Those who want the elected block producers and/or ECAF to protect their interests can opt-in to a new smart contract where ECAF/producers are the arbitration system… The scope of arbitrator power would be limited to that contract alone.”The new EOS constitution attempts to balance the issues surrounding account freezes and arbitrator authority with greater user autonomy, using Ricardian contracts – combining both free-form terms and code terms – to better meet the community’s demands and prevent future controversy.The revised governance model outlines the role of block producers and arbitrators, a consensus for amendment, and terms of liability and immutability on the blockchain. It is still unknown whether the amended constitution will be approved by the community and implemented on the network.

To date, neither party offered an official explanation of the what the Nano Wallet Company described as an “issue discovered related to random seed generation”.The Nano Wallet Company, however, did beef up their original wallet release announcement with a touch of Public Relations — presumably wanting to distance Nano from the blunder:“The Nano Wallet Company is a separate entity, unconnected to the Nano Foundation. While there is some overlap in those working for both companies, the Nano Foundation has no control over the wallets and no relationship with the Nano Wallet Company.”Nano community members were quick to connect the dots to Nano’s previous security breaches. One user went as far as linking the wallet issue to February 2018’s Nano/Bitgrail saga — an alleged $150 million hack of XRB from the now-insolvent Bitgrail exchange.""There is no need to be upset if there is no @bitgrail anymore.

Reserves have always, and will always, match the number of Tethers in circulation.”FSS Report is Not an AuditThe Tether Transparency update may provide information on the amount of capital that Tether has access to, but it’s not an audit — notably, the report is composed by the law firm Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan LLP (FSS), not the original financial auditing firm Friedman LLP.FSS, co-founded by FBI director Louis Freeh, didn’t conduct an official audit, but instead published data gathered during a two-week period in which the firm had access to Tether’s accounts at two different banks:“Earlier this year Tether engaged Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan LLP (FSS) to review bank account documentation and to perform a randomized inspection of the numbers of Tethers in circulation and the corresponding currency reserves.”Related Article: Bitcoin Price Manipulation: Study Suggests $2.5 Billion Tether Used to Create Artificial BTC DemandThe entirety of the report, available via Tether’s website, consists of a mere three pages. The report shows that at a single snapshot point on June 1, 2018, Tether held a little over 2.5 billion USD across two bank accounts. The firm then concluded that “unencumbered assets exceed the balance of fully-backed USD Tethers in circulation” as of the same date.While Tether did hold enough capital to back each USDT at one point, the report does not demonstrate that Tether has consistently secured each individual Tether issued since launch, and does not prove that each Tether is fully backed right now.Tether Official: Audit is ImpossibleStuart Hoegner, Tether’s general counsel, admitted in a phone interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday that it’s not actually possible for Tether to deliver the level of assurance that an audit would provide:“The bottom line is an audit cannot be obtained.”Hoegner stated that major accounting firms are unwilling to engage in an audit of the Tether platform:“The big four firms are anathema to that level of risk … [Tether has] gone for what we think is the next best thing.”Under U.S. law, auditors can be held accountable by third parties for financial information — the 1931 Ultramares decision enabled auditors to be held liable for negligence to the extent that it is equivalent to fraud. The developing nature of the cryptocurrency industry, combined with the lack of regulatory oversight, makes the potential risk associated with a comprehensive audit of the Tether platform too high for professional auditing firms.However, Tether Chief Executive Officer JL van der Velde vehemently defends that the platform does indeed hold sufficient capital to back each USDT. Van der Velde claimed that the FSS report is sufficient evidence that Tether maintains enough reserve capital at a “given moment” in a statement issued to Bloomberg:“Despite speculation, we have consistently stated that Tether is backed by USD reserves at or exceeding the Tethers in circulation at a given moment, and we’re glad to have independent verification of this to answer some of the questions posed by the public.”Posted In: Tether, Altcoins, Stablecoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads You might also enjoy...

Announced on June 18, 2018, ICON (ICX) will initiate a token swap from ERC20 ICX to its mainnet coins in the coming days.ICON Token Swap DetailsAfter a delay originating from a transfer disable issue, ICON is finally migrating off of the Ethereum blockchain and initiating a token swap to its own native mainnet platform.I just published “ICX Token swap schedule announcement” https://t.co/4olPHaUtBs— ICON (@helloiconworld) June 18, 2018According to the official announcement, ICON token swaps will only be made available on three participating exchanges – Binance, Upbit, and Bithumb.“Only Binance, Upbit and Bithumb are the official exchanges that have agreed with ICON for the token swap support. Please beware of other exchanges or third-parties claiming that they support ICX token swap. The list of exchanges will be updated.”The aforementioned exchanges will accept deposits of ERC20 ICX up until June 20. At which time, the token swap will initiate and deposit/withdrawals of ICX will be suspended until the migration process is complete.ICX coins will have a 1:1 exchange rate from ERC20 to mainnet coins (1 ERC20 ICX token = 1 mainnet ICX coin). After the token swap, users will not be able to convert their mainnet coins back to ERC20 ICX.It is also worth noting that only approved exchanges will support ICX mainnet coin trading until further notice.Warnings by ICONGiven that only a few select exchanges are participating in the ICON token swap currently, ICON has warned users of potential scams by third-parties seeking to exploit unknowing users for their ICX coinsIn the “Important Notice” section of the announcement, ICON states:“There may be SCAM attempts impersonating ICON. ICX token swap will only be made through ICONex, Binance, Upbit and Bithumb(as of June 18th). If you find any SCAM attempts such as asking to send your ICX to an individual wallet for the token swap process, please let us know ([email protected])”With false marketing and fraudulent activity still prevalent in the cryptocurrency sector, users and traders are reminded to remain cautious and be aware of suspicious activity.For more information on specific exchange’s token swap details, visit the original announcement here.Posted In: Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
496,CryptoSlate,"EOS Block Producers Violate Constitution, Freeze 7 Suspect Accounts",Jonnie Emsley,1529404200.0,"In violation of the rules of the EOS constitution, the project’s 21 block producers have frozen seven accounts suspected to be compromised.The move was made in line with the EOS911 Initiative — a new security protocol designed to recover stolen funds and return them to the victims of phishing attacks.Knowingly violating rules of the EOS constitution, the block producers are facing criticism for acting beyond their authority. As per the constitution, such action can only be authorized by the blockchain’s arbitration bodies — EOS block producers may only execute their decisions.Article III of the constitution outlines the breach in question:-# Article III – Rights -The Members grant the right of contract and of private property to each other, therefore no property shall change hands except with the consent of the owner, by a valid Arbitrator’s order, or via community referendum.Why did they do it?Put forth by leading block producer EOS42, EOS911 was a hurried initiative to safeguard a number of token holders that were robbed of their private keys. While funds were offered momentary protection by the inactive EOS blockchain — as soon as the mainnet’s 72-hour staking period ended, all affected wallets were vulnerable.EOS block producers (BPs) pleaded their case to EOS Core Arbitration Forum representatives — effectively the blockchain’s law enforcement agency. Waiting for a green light from the arbiters, the BPs received a preliminary notice from ECAF warning the freezing of accounts would soon be sanctioned.Although, all did not unfold as expected. Pointing to the current interim constitution, ECAF’s ruling of inaction meant EOS BPs did not, in fact, have permission. However, this was not enough to deter BPs who swiftly froze the 7 accounts, explaining:“EOS New York chose to enact this freeze because we believed that we were following the spirit of the governance system we as a community seek to create, despite it being formally absent. EOS is a platform meant to enable solutions which protect life, liberty, and property and that’s what we believed we were doing through this emergency action.”Response to the move has been mixed.Amongst proponents of decentralization, the collusion of the block producers has typically been met with disdain. Charlie Shrem, tweeted:If crypto mass adoption involves someone having the power to control, freeze or reverse a transaction.If it involves someone having the power to edit or reverse data on the chain.If it involves losing immutability.Then crypto mass adoption is not worth having. https://t.co/RRHuZKattE— Charlie Shrem (@CharlieShrem) June 19, 2018In favor of EOS, many have been quick to defend the actions, pointing to the BPs’ protection of legitimate account holders.

498,CryptoSlate,The Importance of Stablecoins in the Supply Chain,Izak Fritz,1529377200.0,"Distributed ledger technology and blockchain are poised to revolutionize many industries. Everyone is waiting for that “first killer app” in the blockchain space — an area where the strength of a distributed immutable ledger will fill an immediate need. A natural fit would seem to be the supply chain.The supply chain is the process in which goods are manufactured and moved both overseas and domestically from maker to buyer. Currently, each manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer works within their own systems, with their data squarely locked in their internal database.Any time something goes amiss — such as a late shipment, canceled order, or chargeback — the individual party has to sift through their system data and try to correlate this with any acknowledgments or paper trails they can find from their trading partners — an inefficient and inaccurate process.What Can Blockchain Offer?Blockchain brings about the potential to develop and implement a standardized industry-wide supply chain management system. With an immutable record of every transaction taking place, each party will be privy to the status of products moving through the chain — from manufacturing all the way to the retail customer.Related Story: How Blockchain Technology is Shaking Up the Logistics IndustryWholesalers and manufacturers want to ensure the secure delivery of merchandise, be that to a specific retail store or distribution centers. Equally, retailers have a need to ensure merchandise authenticity arriving from verified and authorized manufacturers. This is especially important in relation to medical products.With the entire process recorded on the blockchain and all the actors having access to the same ledger, immutability and automation provide all parties with the information that will guarantee that merchandise moves at optimal speed through the chain.Smart contracts will be able to automatically trigger actions such as payments of invoices — for example, automating both accounts payable and receivable will eliminate hundreds of man hours spent reconciling documents.Companies are looking at different hybrid methods today whereby blockchain will augment their current practices. Despite this, their financials still revolve around traditional methods such as letters of credit, getting factors to approve invoices for early payments, and manual paper checks.The last step needed for blockchain to fully automate and revolutionize the supply chain space is for payment to be tied in.As cryptocurrency becomes more accepted, many large players in the supply chain are viewing it as an alternative to traditional currencies. The benefits are enticing due to the ease and security of instantaneous and cross-border payments — coupled with the removal of fluctuating values experienced through currency exchange. However, since the start of 2018 key players in the industry are still hesitant to accept crypto payments.With cryptocurrency prices fluctuating so wildly, it becomes almost impossible to forecast or plan a business model around receivables that could be valued at ten times the receiving price — or half of it — within a few weeks.StablecoinsThis is where stablecoins like Stably and the StableUSD stablecoin come into play — allowing companies to immediately stabilize their dollar values and escape the fluctuation that’s rampant in the crypto space.Providing companies with further ability to hedge or invest their receivables in the marketplace give companies the ability to earn more on their services and increase profitability and cash flow.Stably provides the last missing piece of the supply chain/blockchain solution and looks forward to the transformative role StableUSD can play in the near future.Posted In: Adoption, Altcoins, Opinion, Stablecoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

The Russian Central Bank’s piloting process usually takes no more than 45 days, yet the group expects this pilot to come to completion in about two weeks’ time. With that said, digital assets may be available to Russian retail investors banking with Sberbank and Alfa-bank shortly.Anna Ivanchuk, Deputy Head of Sberbank Private Banking said:“We want to offer our clients a completely transparent version of the entrance to digital assets that fully meets the regulatory requirements that will allow them to invest in an interesting product in Russia.”The assets offered on the platform will take the form of six cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC). Not all the digital assets offered were named, but the news report states that the digital assets chosen, account for “75% of the capitalization of all digital assets in the world.” Six of the most trusted digital currencies will be chosen and reviewed every quarter.According to the algorithms used on the platform, the weights of the digital assets change dynamically. According to Alexei Prokofiev — Managing Partner at AddCapital and Chairman of the OCP — the algorithms that will be used show significantly higher yields than individual digital assets or the indexes composed of them.Mr. Prokofiev told Kommersant:“The client actually receives a fund unit. The assets of the fund are stored using custody solutions and audited by the Group IB cyber security. The unit is liquid, it is possible to request a withdrawal to the currency of the client at any time.”According to Prokofiev, the trades on the sandbox platform will only be carried out by audited cryptocurrency exchanges — such as Bitstamp and Kraken.Russia Moving ForwardRussia’s stance on cryptocurrency may have wavered throughout the months, but it wasn’t until early this year that the country made its official stance. Due to the country’s uncertain standpoint, Russian banks were seen to hold back on the integration of blockchain technology, while many banks around the globe jumped on board.Related: Russia’s Supreme Court Decision Paves the Way for Safer Bitcoin and Crypto JournalismIn January of this year, Sberbank made the announcement that is would be opening its own cryptocurrency exchange options via its Swiss branch and just last month, the bank made an even bigger announcement.As per Forklog, Sberbank and the National Settlement Depository (NRD) plan on piloting Russia’s first official Initial Coin Offering (ICO) via the regulatory sandbox.Igor Bulantsev, an executive at Sberbank CIB, told reporters that his banks consider Russian ICOs to be “highly promising” and many of its clients are extremely interested in this new way of fundraising.Posted In: Bitcoin Cash, Russia, Adoption, Altcoins, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

501,CryptoSlate,How Blockchain Technology Is Transforming Digital Advertising,Sam Town,1529301600.0,"The disruption of the cumbersome supply chain industry by platforms such as Waltonchain, VeChain, and Ambrosus is evidence of the potential blockchain may have on centralized systems. However, the next industry to be revolutionized after the decentralization of the supply chain ecosystem may an unexpected one.Accountability and traceability are aspects of blockchain technology that are absent from the labyrinthine digital marketing industry, which is presently valued at over $250 billion dollars annually.The entire digital advertising landscape is unclear, prone to interference from middlemen, notoriously centralized, and highly inefficient – making it the ideal ecosystem for the application of transparent, immutable distributed ledger technology.Waltonchain’s WTC token and VeChain’s VEN soared over 1000% since the Q3 launch in 2017. Which blockchain platform focusing on advertising industry will follow suit?The Digital Advertising Industry: Centralized, Opaque and FraudulentDigital advertising surpasses every form of advertising in the world, including print, television, and billboards. Despite its massive size, the industry is extremely centralized with few large middlemen maintaining controlling a significant portion of the market.Google and Facebook currently dominate the digital advertising ecosystem, controlling an estimated 73% of all online ads. Data collected by the Interactive Advertising Bureau in 2017 shows that 75% of all online ad revenues are dominated by the top 10 companies. The top 25 companies account for an additional 8%, and only 18% of the revenue of the entire digital advertising market is held by the rest of the industry.Digital advertising industry revenue distribution via IABWhile it’s true centralized middlemen are a prominent issue within the digital marketing, the primary issue isn’t with the limited number of advertising channels available to advertisers — it’s the manner in which ad performance is tracked. The digital marketing industry revolves around impressions, which is the number of instances any given advertisement is served to a consumer.2017 monthly total ad expenditure lost on fraud via ANAThe process of tracking impressions can and is easily disrupted by ad-bot scams, fake traffic generation techniques, and a range of other exploitation methods that obfuscate the actual value of a digital marketing campaign. This makes it extremely difficult for organizations purchasing digital marketing to determine whether it is cost-effective.A marketer may spend over $2 million on digital marketing to achieve 1 million impressions, but it’s commonplace for half of them to be generated by bots.This opaque, difficult to track ecosystem results in significant wastage. Published in 2017, Juniper Research’s “Future of Digital Marketing: AI, Ad Fraud, and Ad Blocking” report reveals that more than $51 million is wasted daily on fraudulent impressions. Another study by the Association of National Advertisers in 2017 found that over 9% of desktop display and 22% of video spending was inauthentic, demonstrating the extent to which digital advertising industry is compromised.The three biggest problems facing the digital advertising industry are:Determining whether real people view adsHow to track the effectiveness of advertisingThe absolute control the digital advertising oligarchy exerts over the market — all of which blockchain technology can solve simply and effectivelyHow Blockchain Technology is Revolutionizing the Digital Advertising IndustryThe same features that make distributed ledger technology uniquely suited to the optimization of the supply chain industry make it ideal for solving issues plaguing digital marketing. Blockchain’s transparency, traceability, immutability, and efficiency are set to make the digital marketing oligarchy obsolete.Blockchain technology eliminates the reliance on third-party middlemen crippling the current digital marketing industry. Using blockchain-based platforms, advertisers can connect directly with publishers in a completely transparent manner. The ability to transact via smart contracts ensures that publishers will be able to determine precisely what they are paying for and to only pay if smart contract terms are met.Similarly, the transparent nature of blockchain technology eliminates the possibility of ad fraud. Impressions can be recorded on an immutable distributed ledger, making it far easier for publishers to access consumer metadata to improve campaign efficiency.Consumer data privacy trust via GigyaThe Gugya 2017 State of Consumer Privacy and Trust report shows that consumers have an increasing understanding of the impact of data security, with 68% of consumers refusing to trust brands with their personal information.Blockchain technology enables user metadata to be completely anonymized, or in some cases, even provide consumers with incentivization for sharing their personal data.Bringing the digital advertising market onto the blockchain allows publishers to access meaningful, actionable information by engaging directly with both advertisers and consumers without the need for middlemen.Who is Disrupting the Digital Advertising Industry With Blockchain Tech, and How?The digital advertising blockchain revolution isn’t on the distant horizon — it’s already here.Basic Attention Token is an Ethereum-based token that improves the efficiency of digital advertising by creating a new unit of exchange between publishers, advertisers and users.One of the most successful blockchain-based digital advertising projects is the Basic Attention Token, created by JavaScript creator and Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich.Operating from two successful seed rounds raising $7 million across 2015 and 2016, the BAT project captured over $35 million in an ICO that sold out in just 30 seconds — to only 130 people, with five individuals capturing over 50% of the tokens sold in the crowdsale.The Basic Attention Token, while limited to use only within the Brave browser, takes an interesting position on digital advertising. The Brave browser privately monitors user attention, rewarding consumers with Basic Attention Tokens. Publishers receive BATs for user attention, with revenue increasing or decreasing in tandem with efficiency. Advertisers pay both publishers and consumers with BAT, delivering a transparent, traceable, and cost-effective ecosystem for all parties — as long as consumers are using Brave.MetaX’s adChain solution is another blockchain-based solution intending to disrupt the digital marketing ecosystem without requiring the use of a specific browser. Instead, the adChain project wants to allow buyers to purchase individual impressions, which are encoded into a block and shared with chain participants.Publishers are able to verify impressions, adding them to the ledger to create an audit trail eliminating the risk of ad fraud. Buyers can see how many times an impression was seen, who saw it, and how budget capital was spent by publishers.MetaX recently released its 2018 roadmap for the adChain project, with the adChain advertiser registry set for a late Q3 2018 launch. Alanna Gombert, the Global CRO of MetaX, highlighted the importance of combating ad with blockchain technology in an interview with CryptoSlate:“We are excited to bring transparency, decentralization, and token consensus models to digital advertising. Digital advertising is full of fraud (to the tune of 9 billion dollars) and arbitrageurs. The adserving technology is dated and monolithic. It does not bring in the voice of the people. adChain aims to fix all of that.”The MetaX solution may aim to eliminate digital advertising fraud altogether, but another project is focused on eliminating middlemen. The AdEx platform is designed to destroy the digital advertising oligarchy by creating a smart contract executed marketplace in which advertisers are able to bid for advertising slots.The AdEx solution for publishersAdEx launched the beta of the AdEx dapp in early 2018 and more recently published a roadmap that will see the AdEx protocol — including smart contracts, generalized advertising infrastructure, and a scaling solution — by September 2018.AdEx CEO Ivo Georgiev outlined the upcoming goals of the AdEx platform in an interview with CryptoSlate, asserting that the project is “generalizing/standardizing trading advertising in a decentralized way with the aid of blockchain.”Georgiev stated:“What is coming soon is this protocol definition, and also we’re looking into possibilities to also implement bidding for advertising over NFTs.”There are many other blockchain-based digital advertising platforms, such as Oyster Protocol, AdHive, and Bigbom – all of which incorporate different approaches to the issues presented by the current market paradigm. All operate with similar goals but are presented with the same obstacles — slow adoption rates and the difficulty in delivering a strong value proposition, especially in the enterprise sector.However, the creeping adoption of blockchain technology in the supply chain industry is a strong example of how the self-evident value of distributed ledger efficiency and transparency causes organic implementation — a phenomenon soon likely to be mirrored in the advertising industry on a widespread basis.Posted In: Basic Attention Token, Adoption, Altcoins, Enterprise, Opinion, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

This partnership will allow users access to a host of necessary solutions for continuity.”What is Safe Haven?The trustless, immutable nature of blockchain technology may offer unparalleled security, yet Singapore-based Safe Haven anticipates that cryptocurrencies face the issue of legacy.In acknowledgment, the VeChain team asked:“Safe Haven resolves the question that everyone should be considering: how would your loved ones and partners gain proper access to your digital legacy when you are gone?”Pointing to lost private keys, unwanted blockchain forks, and “stories of lost Bitcoin and other digital assets”, Save Haven highlights the need for a safeguard against unforeseeable losses of cryptocurrency and digital assets.In an explanation, Safe Haven founder Jurgen Schouppe writes:“As I thought of bringing this technology into my family’s everyday life, I knew then and there that my legacy would not pass with it. If I make a paper wallet and the house burns, everything is gone. If I trust an exchange and I am compromised, I lose everything. If I misplace my private key, all is lost with it.”Under the terms set by an individual or business,  Safe Haven’s smart contracts will distribute their private keys, passwords, and bank account credentials to designated third parties for inheritance.While the legacy of cryptocurrencies may be a central concern, Safe Haven will also target other digital assets — including bank and social media accounts, and various passphrases.A dose of success by proxy from VeChain — the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization — may not go amiss as 2018’s extended bear market dissuades investors.Posted In: VeChain, Adoption, Altcoins, Partnerships     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
503,CryptoSlate,"EOS Blockchain Temporarily Halted, Criticized For its Ability to Suspend User Accounts",Joseph Young,1529207700.0,"EOS, the most valuable initial coin offering (ICO) of all time that raised over $4 billion throughout its 1-year-long token sale, has recently received criticisms regarding its latest blockchain halt and controversial statements on its Termination of Agreement, or Article XV.Controversial Centralization IssueEarlier this week, one of the members of an online cryptocurrency community released the Termination of Agreement between EOS and its investors, sparking a debate on the ability of the EOS team to gain control over user funds and reverse transactions.The agreement in question, Article XV, read:“A Member is automatically released from all revocable obligations under this Constitution 3 years after the last transaction signed by that Member is incorporated into the blockchain. After 3 years of inactivity an account may be put up for auction and the proceeds distributed to all Members according to the system contract provisions then in effect for such redistribution.”Essentially, the EOS team explained that if an EOS holder is inactive for more than three years, meaning the holder does not initiate any transaction or hold onto EOS without receiving or sending a transaction, EOS has the authority to take over the account.Related Article: EOS Blockchain Goes Live as Voting Target Reached, Block Producers SelectedOn any other major public blockchain, it is up to the users to spend or hold their funds and it is unacceptable to take that authority away from the users.If a blockchain project has the authority to reverse transactions and suspend the accounts of users, to begin with, it is difficult to argue that the project is decentralized to a large extent.In a decentralized and peer-to-peer ecosystem, logically, no central party should have any sort of authority over transactions and accounts of users. For instance, on Bitcoin and Ethereum, no central party can reverse or suspend the accounts of users, and it is virtually impossible without carrying a 51 percent attack.Even Rick Schlesinger, co-founder of EOS New York, who previously noted that the Termination of Agreement of EOS and the team’s ability to suspend accounts was specifically employed to prevent users from holding onto the cryptocurrency for years without contributing to the ecosystem, recently admitted that Article XV should be scrutinized and it is not appropriate for EOS to decide for what its users can use the tokens.Schlesinger said, in an interview TNW Hard Fork’s Neer Varshney:“I do think the community is going to scrutinize [Article XV] closely (as they should). This is why we’re here – to experiment with this nascent technology and learn about how a governed blockchain can respond to the community’s will.”Still, Schlesinger criticized publications that reported EOS has a fund centralization issue, as those reports failed to consider the fact that exchanges account for the majority of EOS as of current.“The key misstep Trustnodes and others have done is that they’re aggregating the exchange wallets which account for many thousands of individual accounts. If you do not extract these accounts the analysis will be incomplete: garbage in, garbage out.”Recent EOS Blockchain HaltOn June 17, the EOS blockchain was put to a halt after a bug was discovered merely several days after its mainnet launch. The EOS developer community revealed that the bug was originated from a NodeOS issue, which has since been fixed. Block.one, the company that oversees the development of EOS, announced the release of 1.05 with a block producer node and NodeOS upgrade.The EOS team said:“A method to unpause the chain was formulated and is currently underway. Normal EOS chain functions should be available within 3 to 6 hours from the time of the publication. Incoming connections to the network are not being accepted while the work is taking place. Please wait for an update from the Top 21 Block Producers before attempting EOS mainnet transactions.”Related Story: EOS Raises Record-Breaking $4 Billion from CrowdsaleAfter raising $4 billion, EOS has been heavily criticized by industry experts, analysts, and its own investors for a few key controversial decisions and events, leading investors to speculate the long-term future of EOS and the standard of the codebase of the blockchain project.The EOS team remains confident that it will be able to swiftly address bugs and upcoming issues without risking user funds. For long-term growth, experiencing early bugs could be beneficial for EOS as it may allow the blockchain project to develop resilience towards future attacks. But, as of current, some investors remain dissatisfied with EOS and the progress it has made since pre-mainnet launch.

The launch of the Digital Citizen Card will see IOTA’s unique Tangle consensus method and platform used to establish an entirely new digital identification system.The Digital Citizen Card emerged from a partnership established between the Germany-based IOTA foundation and the municipality of Taipei city in January 2018 as the first of a series of projects aiming to establish Taipei as a “Smart City Living Lab.”To comply with context of #GDPR, #TangleID is adapting uPort components into $IOTA network for self-sovereign identity management on which #Taipei Smart City Project Management Office (TPMO) would build several applications.

The Air Box project will see palm-sized air sensor complete with humidity, pollution, light, and temperature detectors installed in homes across Taipei, sharing air quality data via the Tangle and incentivizing participation via IOTA incentivization.Wei-bin Lee, the Commissioner of the Department of Information Technology in Taipei City Government, commented on the future of Taipei and blockchain technology implementation:“IOTA is one of the innovative players in the cryptocurrency world because of its unique technology. With Taipei City always thinking ahead and with IOTA’s technology, this partnership is a strategic move to usher in the era of smart cities to the citizens of Taipei. We welcome the IOTA Foundation to Taipei City and are excited to embark on the future together.”The Tangle-powdered Digital Citizen Card won’t just be used for the elimination of identity theft and voter fraud, however. If successful, the project could be expanded in scope to encompass secure identity-based data sharing across other public service domains such as medical history tracking.IOTA Foundation co-founder David Sønstebø highlighted the flexibility and readiness of the IOTA solution at the announcement of the Taipei Smart City partnership earlier this year:“We are so excited about teaming up with Taipei City. It proves that our next-generation technology is ready for real-world use cases and is more than just a theory.

As such, the lineup of block producers is expected to change rapidly as the EOS blockchain stabilizes and voting continues.The distribution of EOS block producers is located primarily in the US, China, and South America, but retains fairly global distribution as evidenced in a map of EOS block producer distribution created by EOS community members.Interestingly, cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex was able to capture a position as a block producer due to the votes of just four EOS holders. Statistics captured by EOS community members via EOSstats.io demonstrate that Bitfinex captured over 50% of its vote from just four voters, with the top voter accounting for 27% of all votes for Bitfinex.While the consensus method used by the EOS blockchain does allow network participants to exert control over block producer elections, the influence exerted by whales in the election process has a demonstrably significant impact.The EOS token performance has exhibited strong gains subsequent to the launch and is currently swinging upward on a wave of positive market sentiment due to recent SEC clarification on the regulatory status of Ethereum.

As the EOS block producer voting process requires 15% of all tokens to be used for voting before the launch process is complete, the launch is subject to an indefinite delay — shaking market confidence in the project.The EOS mainnet launch was officially announced on June 10, with EOS block producer candidates coming together to deliver a unanimous ‘yes’ to launching the mainnet. However, the complex launch process has run into a roadblock — EOS token holders are not contributing to the voting process, which is essential to the establishment of the new EOS blockchain.EOS mainnet is now live!

The delay in voting response is partly due to the relatively complex method used to submit votes — Block One, the creator of the EOS project, has left the development of a voting tool to the EOS community, causing a significant amount of confusion.Related Article: EOS Go to Launch: Unanimous Yes Vote Gives EOS Blockchain Green LightMoreover, in order to vote, EOS token holders must provide their private keys as part of the voting process — a very concerning proposition for many security-conscious cryptocurrency investors. The only officially supported voting method is the Cleos command line tool released by Block One – a method that requires basic programming comprehension.There are several tutorials available to EOS token holders explaining how to vote with a range of different tools, including the EOS Portal and Scatter, EOSC, EOS-Voter, and Tokenika. The Tokenika solution is the simplest and allows users to cast their vote offline without revealing their private key. The Tokenika platform has also made all code available for public review, yet the prospect of divulging private key information is undoubtedly still hindering the voting process.EOS Community Will Come Together to Launch MainnetDespite the slow response in voting time, EOS community members are confident that the launch will go ahead once 15% of tokens have cast their votes. Roshan Abraham, the Head of Technology at EOS Authority, one of the block producer candidates, commented on the delay in voting:“EOS is a truly decentralised platform and the community is eagerly waiting for the chain to get activated. We are currently at over 6% votes and need 15% for chain activation. We saw EOS registrations take a long time but eventually we got over 98.8% manual registration!”Despite such assurances, EOS token performance has taken a significant hit as a result of the delay in launch, falling by over 10% as market sentiment shifts away from the ailing platform. A conclusion to the voting process could potentially see the value of EOS recover amidst the current bearish market run, but this relies on the EOS community coming together.

The announcement of integration in advance, according to the Coinbase Blog, is to remain consistent with step three and four of the official Coinbase process for adding new assetsWe are pleased to announce our intention to add support for Ethereum Classic (ETC) on Coinbase in the coming months.https://t.co/bUG4iLUr2J— Coinbase (@coinbase) June 12, 2018Coinbase Token Support Set to ExpandThe integration of Ethereum Classic into the list of tokens supported by Coinbase will not occur immediately — Coinbase states that customers will begin to see public-facing APIs and other signs that the asset is being added to the platform while engineering work expands:“When we reach the final testing phase of the technical integration, which we expect to occur over the next few months, we will publicly announce a launch date for trading via our blog and Twitter.”Ethereum Classic, when integrated, will be available across the entire spectrum of Coinbase products — Coinbase Markets will add trading support for Ethereum Classic, and if ETC books achieve sufficient liquidity within a one-hour post-only opening, ETC trading will be available on Coinbase Pro and Prime, as dictated by Coinbase trading rules. Addition to Coinbase will occur after ETC is listed on Pro and Prime.Ethereum Classic will also be integrated into the Coinbase Index, which will be rebalanced to include ETC. Coinbase Custody will add support for Ethereum Classic deposits and withdrawals, with Coinbase hinting that their custody service may offer a wider range of tokens than other Coinbase services:“Note that Custody will likely support more assets than those available to trade on Coinbase Markets, Coinbase Pro, Coinbase Prime and Coinbase for the foreseeable future.”It’s likely that Coinbase Markets, Coinbase Pro, and Coinbase Prime will list more assets than the vanilla Coinbase platform — listing on Coinbase Markets does not guarantee a listing on Coinbase.

We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can’t shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks are only possible in order to correct actual platform bugs or provide functionality upgrades, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests.“Posted In: Coinbase, San Francisco, Altcoins, Exchanges, Price Watch     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Earlier this year, the IOTA team announced the successful operation of the world’s first vehicle charging station at which charging and paying utilize IOTA.IOTA’s upcoming demonstration with Volkswagen, which will occur on Tuesday, June 12 at the Cebit 2018 conference in Hanover, will present a panel discussion entitled “Blockchain in Future Mobility.” The core goals of the IOTA/Volkswagen project is the establishment of a process that facilitates secure over-the-air updating of vehicle software via an immutable storage medium.The importance of data integrity when it comes to vehicles can’t be understated — the FBI warned consumers as early as 2016 of the danger of malicious parties exploiting vehicle software. More recent data released by the SANS Institute Infosec Reading Room demonstrates that it’s possible to inject malicious code into vehicle software updates, disabling or interfering with power steering, applying brakes at any speed, overriding acceleration, and even tighten the driver’s seatbelt.Vehicle security vulnerabilities via SANS InstituteJungwirth, who currently works as Volkswagen’s Chief Digital Officer as well as operating as a member of the Supervisory Board of the IOTA Foundation commented on the importance of blockchain technology in data-sensitive industries:“Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are crucial for the future of trusted transactions. IOTA has great potential to become a DLT leader with the Tangle approach.”’Interestingly, the same report references a two-year legal battle between Volkswagen and a team of European security researchers that identified and attempted to publish the details of a security flaw present within the Volkswagen remote keyless vehicle entry system. Volkswagen tried to shut down the researchers, using litigation as a method of keeping security flaws under wraps.Volkswagen’s latest work with the IOTA project, however, will see the automotive manufacture push for “transparency and digital trust with customers, authorities, and third parties” by using the immutable nature of the IOTA blockchain to implement software updates and, in future, provide customized services such as usage-based insurance.Posted In: IOTA, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
516,CryptoSlate,"IOHK Redesigns Cardano With Brand Refresh, Releases Updated ADA Roadmap",Sam Town,1528512840.0,"Academia-driven blockchain project Cardano announced earlier this week a major redesign of its brand and roadmap, incorporating a new aesthetic drawn from organic structures inspired by the creative efforts of the Cardano community.The Cardano brand redesign was catalyzed in January when IOHK founder and former Ethereum CEO Charles Hoskinson shared a video with the IOHK creative team. Created by YouTube user “Crypto Gource,” the video used Gource, FFmpeg, and Perl to create a sophisticated visualization of the Cardano development process, illustrating the organic growth of the project.Community-Created Content Catalyzes IOHK Creative RebrandThe aesthetic functionality of the video immediately captured the attention of the IOHK team. Drawing from data available via GitHub, the video provides a clear, effective insight into the Cardano project’s activity since inception and demonstrates that for a long time, Cardano was the busiest blockchain project in the industry.“This sparked an idea at IOHK. We’ve had our fair share of trolls, making false accusations online that Cardano is ‘vapourware,’ i.e. that we have no product. This animation wasn’t just beautiful, it was functional, because it destroyed those claims completely.”As the IOHK design team had already launched a project to refresh the Cardano brand, the IOHK team decided to adopt the aesthetic provided by the Cardano development visualization video.With the assistance of creative minds from the Cardano community, the IOHK team reworked the Cardano roadmap and leveraged the technology behind the video — Gource — to make it available via each Cardano website.The Reworked Cardano RoadmapThe newly-refreshed Cardano roadmap incorporates a number of design improvements. Community members can now easily navigate the list of developer commits, browse new features and receive notifications for roadmap updates.The roadmap now provides a countdown to the next report, with a weekly technical report and links to the Cardano community. It’s possible to filter results between separate milestones, such as Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire.Cardano Technical Development Powers AheadThe technical elements of the Cardano project are also pushing forward, with the technical team releasing a rapid-fire spate of updates. The launch of a series of testnets and the early 2018 collaboration between Cardano and another blockchain project — Zencash — has made Cardano one of the more active blockchain projects in the industry.The new Cardano RoadmapZencash announced its partnership with Cardano in January 2018. The two platforms now work together to develop blockchain-based solutions intended to provide financial services to the unbanked.The Cardano team has also been making steady progress on the Daedelus wallet — a release published in late May saw the addition of paper wallet functionality to the wallet, as well as asynchronous wallet restoration and a range of minor ease of use improvements.

517,CryptoSlate,EOS Go to Launch: Unanimous Yes Vote Gives EOS Blockchain Green Light,Sam Town,1528454160.0,"The EOS blockchain launch has been confirmed for launch at 1PM UTC time today, with a unanimous decision amongst voters. The mainnet is now in the process of being launched, with a live feed provided by EOS Authority counting down the seconds to activation.The EOS mainnet activation process has been lengthy, with block producer candidates — who will function as validators in the network — voting to determine whether the blockchain will go live or not. The EOS project, created by Block. One, raised roughly $4 billion and will use a consensus mechanism that allows network participants to “vote in” block producers.EOS LAUNCH IS A GO! The blockchain will launch at 1300 UTC Saturday. GO EOS!! #eosio #blockchain #cryptocurrency— EOS Go (@go_eos) June 9, 2018EOS Mainnet Launch UnderwayThe EOS mainnet launch is currently in full swing and will consist of five stages. The snapshot stage follows the finalization of the EOS ICO last week, which has resulted in a final snapshot of all balances and accounts for the crowdsale completed by block candidate EOS Authority first.Related Story: EOS Raises Record-Breaking $4 Billion from CrowdsaleThe second stage of the launch is the boot stage, in which the EOS chain is booted with snapshot data and all initial contracts, followed by the test stage. The test stage, already complete as of the time of this report, was subject to a short delay due to a range of security tests and the necessity of a “go” vote from block producer candidates.The enable stage will see the block producer community release a joint statement once it’s safe for network participants to vote. For the EOSIO chain to be considered enabled and valid. 15% of all tokens will need to stake votes for block producers. There is no set period for this voting process — the time frame of the enabling stage will depend on the EOS community.Roshan Abraham of EOS Authority commented on the voting process:“We are currently working with other block producer candidates to launch the EOS mainnet. The chain will be launched with EOS v1.0.2 which was released a few hours ago.”Once 15% of all tokens have been staked and used to vote, the EOS chain is considered valid, resulting in all normal functions of the chain being activated. Appointed block producers will be replaced by the block producers that have been voted in by the EOS community, and the chain will go live. At this stage, EOS holders will be able to unstake their EOS balance and begin executing transactions such as RAM trading, payments, Dapps, and more.Block Producer Candidates Go Head to HeadThere are currently more than 200 EOS block producer candidates competing for nomination as community-appointed block producers — a map provided by EOS GO demonstrates a wide distribution of candidates across the world:EOS Block producer candidate map via EOS GOThe sheer amount of different block producer candidates available to vote for makes it difficult to determine which players are able to best contribute to the EOS ecosystem. Community efforts toward block producer classification, however, have resulted in the creation of a comprehensive list that breaks down block producer candidates by public presence, tech plans, scaling plans, community engagement, and more.The launch of the EOS mainnet is a major step forward for the high-profile EOS project, which has captured a large amount of both positive and negative community attention since inception. The manner in which the genesis block of the chain will be created should prove to be an exciting event, as the final candidate will be chosen randomly from the list of communist-elected block producers.Posted In: EOS, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Offer subject to change, ID required, validity decided at the sole discretion of Block One.— Daniel Larimer (@bytemaster7) May 28, 2018Should Block One recognize all 12 bugs, this would equate a net payout of $120,000 for a week’s work, according to the hacker:Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week.— Guido Vranken (@GuidoVranken) June 4, 2018Having previously discovered nine bugs, Vranken — who describes himself as an “Ethereum Foundation dedicated fuzz tester” — will earn more than $200,000 for his contributions to the program.EOS: All Systems Go, or Cracks Appearing?Vranken’s findings come just days after a Chinese cybersecurity firm discovered a “critical bug” in the EOS codebase. The report notes:“The attacker can steal the private key of super nodes or control content of new blocks. What’s more, attackers can pack the malicious contract into a new block and publish it. As a result, all the full nodes in the entire network will be controlled by the attacker.”After identifying and exploiting the “buffer out-of-bounds write vulnerability,” Beijing-based Qihoo 360 reported the issue to Dan Larimer — who quickly clarified the rumored delay of the mainnet launch:Media has incorrectly reported a potential delay in the release of EOSIO V1 due to software vulnerabilities. Our team has already fixed most and is hard at work with the remaining ones. EOSIO V1 is on schedule; please stay tuned to our EOSIO channels for official information.— EOS (@EOS_io) May 30, 201878 hours on at the time of press, the boot process has been initiated — the first of four stages in the launch. A public block producer appointed by EOS, EOS Nation describes the current state of play:“Verify Snapshot & Boot: ERC-20 token Snapshot is verified by EOS Mainnet Launch Group (EMLG) and third parties. Appointed Block Producers within the EMLG initiate the Boot process.”While Vranken’s compensation may appear generous, one must note that EOS — a $12.5 billion start-up — now stands in a pivotal position.

A recent positive swing for RHOC, however, has seen the value of the tokens transferred climb to $1.45 million. Pithia released a statement regarding the purchase in a recent press release:“With the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, this investment is a strong indicator of the confidence DigitalTown has in RChain, the future success of the network, and the future success of digital currencies in general.”Posted In: Seattle, Adoption, Altcoins, Regulation     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
520,CryptoSlate,IOTA Unveils Qubic: The Key to an “IOTA-based World Supercomputer?”,Jonnie Emsley,1528070400.0,"After weeks of speculation, IOTA has given clarity on its enigmatic Qubic project — or what it describes as “the most significant contribution to the IOTA stack” to date.Aimed at facilitating smart contracts, oracles, and outsourced computation, the young Qubic protocol may be a future asset to IOTA — the 9th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.The move will likely come as welcome news to IOTA enthusiasts, who have waited precisely a month since the team’s May 3 unveiling of the project:We are moving rapidly towards the next epoch of IOTA, today the IOTA Foundation is excited and proud to start the official unveiling of Qubic.https://t.co/U87nKaZWnI#IOTA #Qubic— IOTA (@iotatoken) May 3, 2018What is Qubic? A self-stated “work in progress”, Qubic is a new protocol layer for the IOTA ‘Tangle’.Where IOTA may offer near-instant transaction through its DAG-based ledger technology, its architecture may have limited its application to specific scenarios — namely the Internet of Things.Enter: Qubic — purportedly offering IOTA the functionality of a fully-fledged smart contract platform such as Ethereum — while offering the scalable, zero-fee utility permitted by DAG technology.IOTA explains this evolution on Qubic’s own sub-domain:“The original Qubic idea had some hard to overcome problems. The IOTA protocol was, in fact, created to help solve those problems. Indeed, IOTA was designed to become the global standard for IoT messaging and payments. Qubic follows that standard, and is made possible by fee-free IOTA transactions,”Originally conceived in a September 2012 post on BitcoinTalk, Qubic — or Quorum Based Coin — denotes the idea of a cryptocurrency offering all the utility of Bitcoin, with none of its disadvantages.While building on this concept, the IOTA team have quickly disclaimed that IOTA’s Qubic will not employ a new token or any form of airdrop.Qubic: IOTA’s Secret Weapon? While IOTA has positioned itself primarily as “Enabling the true Internet-of-Things,” the reported functionality of Qubic would suggest loftier heights are in sight.In a manner remarkably close to Ethereum’s mission statement, IOTA describes how Qubic will ultimately “secure the IOTA Tangle: an IOTA-based world supercomputer.” When described in detail, it can be seen how deep the (Qubic) rabbit hole goes:“Specifically, Qubic is a protocol that specifies IOTA’s solution for quorum-based computations, including such constructs as oracle machines, outsourced computations, and smart contracts. Qubic provides general-purpose, cloud- or fog-based, permissionless, multiprocessing capabilities on the Tangle.”That is, Qubic’s broad scope would transform IOTA into a regular dynamo — a jack of all trades up against a plethora of blockchain-based rivals: smart contract platforms, distributed computing networks, oracle networks, messaging platforms, peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies, and more.The IOTA Foundation’s track record of execution and recent momentum would certainly lend IOTA enthusiasts enough reason to place their faith in Qubic.Posted In: IOTA, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Now, it has been discovered on the Ethereum blockchain that the EOS project sent 200,000 ETH to Bitfinex for liquidation. The massive selloff is preceding the June 2nd launch of the EOS network.Trustnodes tracked the transactions that EOS made to Bitfinex through the Ethereum blockchain. The EOS team sold off millions of dollars of ETH over the past thirty days, flooding Bitfinex, in what some believe to be a move to lower the price of ETH.EOS has publicly declared that their direct competition is Ethereum and that they have the technology to displace the blockchain giant.Flooding the MarketRelated: Is EOS a Factor in the Ethereum Price Crash?On the 28th of May, the price of Ethereum plummeted on Bitfinex.The usual trading volume of ETH on the exchange is around 20,000 an hour, however, on that Monday morning, the trading volume was upwards of 180,000 ETH in just one hour on the one exchange, with other exchanges, such as GDAX, still experiencing normal trading volumes.The price of ETH dropped to around $515 (trading at less than $500 on Bitfinex) – around a 9% drop in less than 24 hours. The rumors were that EOS was behind the move and thanks to Ethereum’s public blockchain, it has been confirmed that they were in fact behind the sale.Will EOS Win the Smart Contract War?It remains to be seen who will become the go-to platform for distributed smart contract-based applications.On paper, it seems that EOS project may be able to disrupt the Ethereum network as it will be able to handle more transactions per second. However, the Ethereum network has a strong first-mover advantage and Vitalik Buterin was quoted as saying that second-layer solutions such as sharding and plasma will allow the network to eventually process 1 million transactions per second.All Love is Not LostRelated Story: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Helps Daniel Larimer Code, Says EOS “Not Actually Safe”Although the two decentralized application platforms appear to be at war, all love is not lost between the two teams.In May of 2018, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, offered advice to Daniel Larimer, one of the developers and founders of EOS.Block.one is launching the EOS network on June 2nd.

IOTA’s open-source ledger allows for feeless peer-to-peer microtransactions and the interconnectedness of machines. For a more thorough and concise introduction to IOTA, please see our guide.Lasse Meholm, Head of Distributed Ledger Technology at DNB, said about the partnership:“As Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) communication and payment for microservices seem to escalate in the future, we think engaging in a Distributed Ledger based technology like IOTA gives us valuable experience and know-how on future revenue streams and business models. We are looking forward to dive into the IOTA space.”Earlier this week, IOTA partnered with the United Nations. The UN is interested in using IOTA’s technology to cut down on intermediary expenses.Assuming DNB ASA discovers a logistical use case for the Tangle, the partnership is an important milestone for the IOTA Foundation. IOTA’s most recent partnership with the Norwegian bank, alongside their recent UN partnership and the announcement of the Trinity wallet, is well received amongst the IOTA community.Investors remain optimistic, IOTA is up 11.33% today and currently trading at $1.93For more information about IOTA including price, market cap, technical information and social media links, please see our IOTA coin profile.Posted In: IOTA, Adoption, Altcoins, Partnerships     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Currently, Weiss Ratings assigns letter grades to nearly 55,000 investments and institutions such as stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, insurance companies, and banks. The company made the pivot to cryptocurrencies back in January 2018.Weiss Ratings ScaleThe ratings given to these cryptocurrencies are based on an average of two different grades that are given based on the project’s investment risk/reward grade and technology/adoption grade.Martin Weiss, founder of Weiss Ratings noted:“The overall Weiss Rating is based on a complex algorithm — not simply an average of the two component grades. At this stage in the industry’s transition to newer technologies, it remains extremely difficult for any one coin to achieve top scores across the board. Older generation coins with broader adoption typically lag in technology. Alternative coins with more advanced technology lag in adoption. And none currently have a risk-reward balance that’s comparable to many traditional investments.”The company states their overall goal is to help the public avoid the ‘hype and fear’ and to invest with more confidence and awareness of potential dangers.Investors should interpret Weiss’ grading scale with these terms:A = ExcellentB = GoodC = FairD = WeakE – Very WeakThe plus or minus in a grade indicated the lower or upper third of a grade range. The F grade is assigned to cryptocurrencies that have had credible allegations of fraud.Weiss’s WinnersNo cryptocurrencies on the list received an A or B+ rating, but 14 received a B or a B-.

Sun wrote:“Today, I announce with confidence that development for TRON Mainnet, Odyssey 2.0 is complete and all materials have been submitted to Github. From this day forth, the TRON community will be able to download and run TRON’s official mainnet Odyssey 2.0 on the TRON Github page.”Of course, TRON’s emergence as one of the most popular blockchain platforms didn’t occur without a little assistance.Related Story: TRON Prepares for Mainnet Launch and Competition with EthereumTRON acknowledged Ethereum’s role in helping the company achieve its early fundraising acquisitions and initial platform proliferation.However, they cited Ethereum’s shortcomings as the reason for their pursuit of an independent blockchain. More specifically, Ethereum’s slow adoption of modern blockchain standards and what TRON describes as “an authoritarian system dominated by the foundation and develop team” initiated the move.However, developing an independent blockchain capable of achieving TRON’s goals is a significant undertaking.A Community ApproachIn his comments on the platform’s release, Sun noted the extensive efforts of the TRON development community to create an entirely new platform in just three months.In less than a year, TRON’s team expanded from fewer than 20 paid participants to a global collective of more than 200 people, and this growth is evidenced by the platform’s rapid progress.Mr. Sun identifies several of the platforms noteworthy accomplishments in that time, including:2,153 commits547 merged forks15 software iterations102 new features384 unit tests461 function testsIn short, it’s been a very busy several months for the TRON team, and the next several weeks will be full of further developments and advancements.A Time for TestingAlthough it officially launched on May 31st, Odyssey 2.0 will remain in beta testing throughout June, and it will formally transition on June 25th. TRON is billing this date as the network’s Independence Day. At this time, TRON token migration will be complete, and they will operate as an independent blockchain entity.TRON promised additional regarding blockchain explorers, wallets, and infrastructure-related apps will be announced on June 5th.Harkening Neil Armstrong’s triumphant moon landing proclamation, Mr. Sun exclaimed:“Odyssey 2.0 launch is one small step for TRON, one giant leap for blockchain.”Interestingly, TRON’s announcement did not have a positive impact on its digital currency’s value. At the time of publication, TRON’s value dropped 15% in the past week, and it’s down slightly since the announcement.

527,CryptoSlate,ADA Bounces Back 13% After Cardano Launches First Smart Contracts Testnet,Sam Town,1527552660.0,"Academia-driven blockchain platform Cardano, launched the first iteration of its KEVM test net, catalyzing an ADA price recovery of over 13% in the last 24 hours.Announced on May 28, the new testnet is the first correct by construction version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine — KEVM is designed to define the formal semantics of the EVM in the K framework in a manner consistent with the methodical and scientific approach adopted by the Cardano team in the development of the project.The KEVM smart contracts testnet has been launched! Developers will be able to take any application that runs on the EVM and execute it on the KEVM – This is a necessary step towards the promise of third-generation blockchains. Read more on our forum: https://t.co/m0RgsQQsz0— Cardano Foundation (@CardanoStiftung) May 29, 2018KEVM Testnet Goes LiveThe new testnet is set to accelerate the growth of the Cardano project, as developers will be able to take any application that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine and execute it on the KEVM. This process can also be used to determine whether smart contracts work correctly by formally specifying the desired properties of the contract in K, which is then combined with the KEVM specification. In turn, the K framework can be used to verify the desired properties.The development of the KEVM testnet is led by Runtime Verification founder and UIUC Professor Grigore RosuI, who commented on the release of the testnet:“This is an important first in cryptocurrency that is a necessary step towards the promise of third-generation blockchains.”The launch of the KEVM testnet precedes the upcoming launch of the IELE testnet, which will function as a Cardano virtual machine. Unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine, IELE will operate as a register-based machine — IELE will possess an unbounded number of registers and support unbounded integers.In a similar manner to the Ethereum, IELE will implement a gas limit in order to restrict resource usage and prevent DoS attacks. These features, while difficult to implement, were labeled “tricky but manageable” by the Cardano development team.   Cardano 7 Nov at 2:21 am UTC$0.21  13.37%Cardano, currently ranked #7 by market cap, is up 13.37% over the past 24 hours. ADA has a market cap of $5.33B with a 24 hour volume of $178.26M.Cardano Price Chart  Cardano Aims to Eliminate Smart Contract VulnerabilityThe two testnets are intended to make it easier to compose secure smart contracts, establishing automated techniques that mathematically authenticate contracts and allowing IELE to support smart contracts written in any language with formal semantics in K.  Ultimately, KEVM and IELE will enable official verification tools to eliminate smart contract vulnerabilities before they occur.Related Story: Cardano (ADA) Update: Latest Technical Release Reveals Solid Foundation Being BuiltThe issue of smart contract vulnerabilities is a major point of concern within the cryptocurrency ecosystem — the upcoming launch of the EOS mainnet recently suffered a temporary setback when a Chinese security company identified smart contract execution flaws that could jeopardize the security of the entire network.A recent investigation into the security of smart contracts entitled “Finding The Greedy, Prodigal, and Suicidal Contracts at Scale” found that 3.4% of all smart contracts are faulty. The study, which verified 125,000 smart contracts with an algorithm that checked for the most common vulnerabilities found that nearly 4,905 ETH could be captured by exploiting faulty contracts.Smart contract exploits have led to notable, significant hacks in the history of cryptocurrencies, such as the $55 million DAO hack or the 150,000 ETH Parity hack. The issue of faulty smart contracts is growing rapidly as blockchain technology and cryptocurrency gains real-world traction, making smart contract safety critical.The launch of the new Cardano KEVM testnet is a key milestone in establishing new protocols and standards that result in the creation of reliable, safe, smart contracts as the industry matures.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Price Watch     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
528,CryptoSlate,Potential EOS Mainnet Launch Delay: Internet Security Giant Identifies High-Risk Security Vulnerabilities (Updated),Sam Town,1527594000.0,"Qihoo 360, China’s largest internet security company, recently published an announcement that the upcoming EOS mainnet launch scheduled for June 2, 2018, could potentially be delayed due to a series of high-risk security vulnerabilities that could cripple the entire EOS network.Update: Chinese media outlet Jinse reports that the security flaw identified by the 360 team was isolated and resolved by the EOS development team at 2 PM on the 29th.The May 29th announcement states that the 360 team identified a flaw within the EOS code that would make it possible for nodes within the EOS network to be remotely compromised:“Recently, the 360 Vulcan team discovered a series of high-risk security vulnerabilities in blockchain platform EOS. It has been verified that some of these vulnerabilities can remotely execute arbitrary code on the EOS node. That is, remote attacks can directly control and take over all nodes running on EOS.”Qihoo 360 States EOS Susceptible to “Supernode Attack”The EOS development team is currently pushing toward the June 2nd launch of the EOS platform, with exchanges such as Binance, Bitfinex, and Kucoin all announcing support of the shift from an EOS ERC-20 token to the new EOS blockchain.The launch, however, may be interrupted if the EOS development team is unable to correct the glitch identified by Qihoo 360 before the launch date. According to Qihoo 360, the EOS network makes it possible for malicious individuals to publish a smart contract containing code that could potentially create an attack vector.1/ Chinese Internet security giant 360 has found ""a series of epic vulnerabilities"" in the #EOS platform. Some of the bugs allow arbitrary code to be executed remotely on EOS nodes and even taking full control of the nodes.Source (in Chinese): https://t.co/pt6nj6EodP— cnLedger [Not giving away ETH] (@cnLedger) May 29, 2018Concerningly, the flaw identified by the Qihoo 360 team could be used to repackage a malicious contract into a new block, which would then cause all full nodes in the network to be controlled remotely. This eventuality, states the Qihoo 360 team, would be catastrophic to the EOS network:“Since the system of the node is completely controlled, the attacker can “do whatever it wants”, such as stealing the key of the EOS super node, controlling the virtual currency transactions of the EOS network; and acquiring other financial and privacy data in the EOS network participating node system — such as a user’s key stored in the wallet, key user profiles, privacy data, and more.”Such an incident, according to Qihoo 360, would make it possible for attackers to capture a node in the EOS network into a botnet.EOS Mainnet Launch Could Be DelayedThe Qihoo 360 team notified EOS officials on the 29th, and are currently actively working with the EOS development team to ensure the issue is fixed before launch. There is a chance, however, that the launch may be postponed if a solution is not found before June 2nd:“On the early morning of the 29th, 360 first reported the vulnerability to EOS officials and helped them repair the security risks. The person in charge of the EOS network said that the EOS network will not be officially launched until these issues are fixed.”The alleged security flaw is apparently located within the smart contract virtual machine on the EOS platform, but the Qihoo 360 team has not yet published any documentation regarding the security issue.Roshan Abraham, the Head of Technology at EOS block production candidate EOS Authority, states that while EOS Authority has not given any specific information regarding the security vulnerability, it’s unlikely that the EOS project has VM issues:“The VM used in EOS is web assembly. Web assembly is actively developed by Google, Microsoft and other major companies. It is highly unlikely to have VM issues. It is most likely to be a specific issue with nodeos (the program that runs the block production on each block producer’s server)”Collaboration between the EOS team and Qihoo 360 will likely benefit the EOS project, allowing EOS to leverage the experience and resources of the security giant in order to enhance the overall security of the EOS blockchain before the anticipated launch date.Addendum: Information provided by Jinse demonstrates that the 360 team was able to confirm the exploit at 1 PM on May 28 and subsequently reported the security flaw to the EOS development team at 10 PM the same day. EOS requested that 360 not disclose the details of the vulnerability and subsequently repaired the security issue by 2 PM on the 29th.Posted In: EOS, Altcoins, Privacy, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

With the EOS mainnet launch only days away, questionable sell-offs of ETH suggest the competing smart contract platform may be the price crash culprit.EOS Dumping ETHRelated Article: Price Watch: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin Continue Massive DropsEthereum went from $570.85 to $508.14 USD in the past 24 hours in a bearish downturn.Ethereum is currently trading at $523.58 USD.Unusually high volumes of Ethereum trading on the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange indicates that the Ethereum price crash could be the result of one entity.The second largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Bitfinex leads the total 24-hour trading volume of Ethereum at $250 million USD. This is nearly double the amount traded on OKEx – the next highest exchange by volume, at $110 million USD.Data gathered from CoinMarketCap on 5/28/18.Trustnodes reported a staggering 180,000 ETH was sold within one hour on Bitfinex around 10 p.m. PST on Sunday, May 27th, while other leading exchanges, such as GDAX and OKEx remained stable – trading an average of 20,000 ETH per hour.In the past four days, EOS spent nearly $1.4 million USD in ETH, $400,000 of which was exchanged within the last 24 hours.Source: TrustnodesEOS Hoarding ETHFrom early April 2018 to May 2018, Trustnodes reported that almost $950 million USD– or 1,268,066 ETH, was spent by EOS under its parent company block.one – a total transaction amount surpassing any other ERC-20 token at the time.According to Etherscan, EOS still holds 237,000 ETH in its “EOSCrowdsale” wallet address with an additional 916,000 ETH held under the wallet address “EOS-Owner.” In total, EOS currently holds an aggregate amount of 1.1 million ETH.Most of the 24-hour trading volume for Ethereum occurred on Bitfinex on the same day EOS was listed on the same exchange.

531,CryptoSlate,IOTA Releases Updated Stratified Testnet Scheme,Peter Ivancic,1527308220.0,"The development of the IOTA network has taken a significant step forward with the launch of several new testnets that will replace the current “Mainnet Lite” test Tangle. The suite of new IOTA testnets will allow developers to work on apps, collect statistics, and stress test transactional limit of the network, working toward the ultimate goal of pushing the Tangle to the limit.A recent blog post on the IOTA Medium page unveiled the team’s plans to roll out four separate testnets in order to serve the community’s needs. The post reveals how the current system of development has resulted in the inefficient management of projects, allowing exchanges and active marketplaces to utilize the testnet while community members continue function testing on the mainnet.The upcoming varied iterations of testnet work to streamline the development environment by allowing developers to interact with different versions of the IOTA Reference Implementation, a series of APIs and Libraries used to interface with the network. The new array of developer environments will consist of:Devnet – previously the Testnet, it will be running the latest stable version of IRI without costing developers any real tokens, allowing for limitless trial testingSpamnet – a convenient load balanced network that doesn’t require participants to operate a node, currently operating with seven nodes behind the load balancer primarily used to assist to analyze effects of spam on the networkCanarynet – an upcoming network, presumably used to operate the most recent experimental builds along with untested featuresTestnet – part of an upcoming suite of testnets, little has been revealed apart from its iterative and high throughput nature, allowing for greater expansion at a later dateThese new stratified Testnets are focused on providing developers with greater specificity when it comes to R&D, as previous localized simulations are often limited in scope when compared to real-world data. All testnets will be hosted at iota.org and will come with their own visualization tools and dashboards, examples of which have already been published for the spamnet.A Targeted Approach to Solving Recent IssuesIOTA’s main goal for the new testnets is to combat two prominent network phenomena that have been regularly recurring – blowballs and CTPS variance. Blowballs are a network structure in which a large number of transactions all reference a singular transaction, preventing the Tangle from growing organically by trapping incoming transactions inside of the blowball.CTPS variance refers to the overall instability in confirmed transactions per second.In the IOTA white paper the tangle is depicted as a uni-directional graph with a uniformly random set of connections between graph nodes. (Source)These new stratified testnets serve both the IOTA team and the developer community to better operate and experiment with realistic environments, allowing them to accelerate workflow and close the gap between development machines and the IOTA Mainnet release.The team’s commitment to providing tools to facilitate fast product turnaround demonstrate a concerted effort to maintain an optimum work environment for both internal and external sources of platform growth.IOTA is down 16% over the past week.Related Story: United Nations Office for Project Services Announces Collaboration with IOTAThe developer update follows IOTA’s recent signing of a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) to provide a permissionless, open source distributed ledger as the communications backbone for connected Industry 4.0 devices.The IOTA project is arguably one of the most unique projects present in the blockchain ecosystem, working toward the establishment of an “autonomous economy” of interconnected IoT devices on a massive scale.The launch of the new testnet suite is set to dramatically improve and streamline the development process, bringing IOTA’s machine economy future one step closer.For more information on IOTA including news, price, market cap and exchanges its being traded on, please see our IOTA coin profile.Posted In: IOTA, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

533,CryptoSlate,0x Up 30% After Paradex Acquisition and Coinbase Pro Announcement,Austin Tuwiner,1527228000.0,"Decentralized exchange 0x Protocol (ZRX) has increased 30% after Coinbase announced the acquisition of Paradex and the launch of Coinbase Pro.What is Paradex?Paradex is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on top of the 0x protocol, that allows hundreds of ERC-20 tokens and other cryptocurrencies to be traded from the comfort of users own wallets, in a fast, secure and decentralized manner.One of the greatest features of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is the removal of a trusted third party. Centralized exchanges are plagued with issues such as hacks and attempted 51% attacks, causing money to be lost, and innocent users to be harmed.What is Coinbase Pro?Coinbase plans to integrate Paradex’s features into GDAX, their Global Digital Asset Exchange, allowing Ethereum tokens and other cryptocurrencies to be traded. In addition to the integration, Coinbase plans to rename GDAX to Coinbase Pro.This is huge news, as many people have been criticizing Coinbase’s slow movement on adding more cryptocurrencies to their platform. This will also allow them to compete with other exchanges such as Binance, that plans to add fiat pairings and decentralization to their exchange.0x Price CorrelationWhalePanda, one of the Magical Crypto Friends and longtime cryptocurrency supporter, questioned the correlation between this addition and the jump in 0x’s price. He compares Coinbase’s use of Paradex to the Ripple Protocol having another bank onboard.The @coinbase acquisition of @ParadexIO resulted in a big $ZRX pump. What is interesting is that while Paradex uses the 0x protocol, they don't use the token itself. This is the equivalent of $XRP pump when a bank says they are using the Ripple protocol. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ #CryptoThings pic.twitter.com/umMipmcFym— WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) May 25, 2018While this a valid point, there is one main difference. The 0x protocol is self-governing, allowing users that hold a certain amount of 0x to have a say on the future of the project. Because Paradex’s acquisition will lead to more use of the 0x protocol, the underlying protocol can be seen as more valuable. From the 0x Protocol’s white-paper:“Protocol tokens may be used to drive a decentralized update mechanism that allows for continuous integration of updates into the protocol while also protecting the protocol’s users and stakeholders.”GDAX will officially be retired on June 29, 2018, and transitioned into Coinbase Pro. Paradex integration should be out in the next few months as the Coinbase team plans to make some changes to the project.Posted In: Coinbase, San Francisco, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Token migration from ERC20 TRX to Mainnet TRX will occur between June 21st – June 25th (GMT+8). If your TRX is held on an exchange, no action is required. If your TRX is held in a wallet, you must deposit your TRX to an exchange before June 24, 2018, to avoid any losses. From June 21st– 25th, TRX withdrawals on exchanges will be suspended. On June 25th, both TRX deposits and withdraws on exchanges will be suspended. Deposits and withdraws will resume on June 26th. During this period, TRX trading will not be affected. If your TRX is held in a wallet and you were not aware of the migration notice, or saw the migration notice after June 25th, please visit our permanent token-exchange counter to exchange your tokens for Mainnet TRX.”The TRON team is ensuring the token migration is as smooth and effortless for its investors by working with the exchanges currently holding TRX. If you are a holder of TRX on one of its major exchanges, no further action needs to be taken. However, if you hold your TRX in a wallet, you will need to transfer your funds to an exchange before June 21.Not all exchanges have agreed to physically handle the token migration, but most of the major ones are participating.TRON ExchangesOn May 23, Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, tweeted about the latest exchange to support the token migration.#TRX $TRX @Liqui_Exchange will support #TRON blockchain upgrade and token migration.🔉https://t.co/1Pjpjd9xZb— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 23, 2018The exchanges currently supporting the TRX token swap include:BiboxBinanceBitfinexBithumbBitpieBittrexBixinCoinnestCoinrailDragonexGate.ioLiquiRIGHTBTCUpbitZebpayMany TRX holders are waiting for OKEx, Koinex, Bit-Z, and Huobi to partake in the migration.Still, if the exchange that you use does not reach an agreement by next month, there is still the option to trade your tokens on TRON’s token exchange counter.TRX Price UpdateAt press time, TRX is currently trading at $0.07151 per coin, down -1.51 percent, in 24 hours.TRON is up 7 percent over the past week.For more information about TRON, including price, technical information and team members, see our TRON coin profile.Posted In: Tron, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
535,CryptoSlate,Lost In Tokenization: 65% of EOS Users Still Haven’t Registered for Token Swap,Peter Ivancic,1527129540.0,"EOS is set to launch its mainnet on June 2nd, but statistics from EOSAuthority, a block producer candidate in London, reveal that 65% of users have not registered their tokens for the upcoming migration.Since release EOS has operated on the Ethereum network’s ERC20 token, allowing the token to operate a groundbreaking one year long ICO to provide investors with greater availability. The migration will see EOS move onto its separate dApp focused blockchain designed to facilitate a theoretical million transactions per second.A Leap in Blockchain ThroughputThe EOS team revealed in a Medium post that worst-case predictions place the network at 1,000 TPS, which is still a significant boost from the current 15TPS supported by the Ethereum blockchain. The EOS back-end will be supported by 21 supernodes elected using the dPOS system of delegation with Bitmain’s Antpool running to be one of the networks official block producers.Related Story: EOSIO Dawn 4.1 Release Changes Core Token Name From EOS to SYSWhile investors have shown strong excitement for the mainnet release, the migration process has been anything but smooth. In order for investors to utilize the new network, they must migrate their tokens from the Ethereum network to the EOS mainnet via a registration process.Even though EOS has made the registration process fairly easy, statistics from EOSAuthority have shown that only 35% of EOS tokens have been registered. This is a major concern for unregistered holders of EOS, as ERC20 tokens not registered before the Mainnet launch will not be counted in the blockchain snapshot meaning the unregistered coins will be incompatible with the new network, rendering them worthless in the short term.Community Support to the RescueThere has been no official statement from the EOS development team as to whether unregistered tokens will be able to transition onto the mainnet at a later date, but community members have been working on a fallback solution. EOSAuthority’s Roshan Abraham spoke to CryptoSlate and said:“We encourage all users to complete registration and use a simple tool on our website eosauthority.com to confirm that you have registered successfully. The community is actively developing a fallback solution so that unregistered wallets will be registered automatically and claimed by converting an ethereum private key to an EOS private key.”With such a low rate of registration, concerns have been raised over whether users will be actively participating in the network upon release. Given the importance of community engagement within the dPOS network structure and their responsibility in voting for official block producers, the lack of activity could degrade some of the networks core functionality.While no one reasonably expects 100% registration of all EOS tokens, such a large portion of tokens locked out of circulation may cause a shift in the price of the mainnet token on release day.With a mainnet release just around the corner, excitement is building as the crypto community will be able to finally bear witness to the potential of a unique blockchain 3.0 platform.Posted In: EOS, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

537,CryptoSlate,"Verge Victim to Yet Another 51% Attack, XVG Down 15% In Past 24 Hours",Peter Ivancic,1527046800.0,"The privacy and security-focused coin Verge has been subject to yet another 51% attack, seeing a price of XVG drop 15% over the past 24 hours.Last month, a Bitcointalk forum user ‘ocminer’ announced Verge was experiencing a similar 51% attack due to a bug in its code which enabled attackers to spoof timestamps enabling the hacker to repeatedly use the same mining algorithm to mint blocks.Verge is down 14.9% over the past 24 hours.Under regular circumstances, Verge forces miners to use different algorithms for each block in an attempt to prevent any single mining pool from controlling the majority of the hashing power.By leveraging a series of exploits within the XVG code, the attacker was able to mine multiple blocks at one-second intervals using only the Scrypt hashing algorithm for three hours.The Verge team responded by patching the code with an emergency commit to the repo and later initiating a hard fork, which according to ‘ocminer’ invalidated the most recent snapshot causing new wallets to fail to synchronize when building from the chain from scratch.Recent Attack Vector Seems Eerily FamiliarThe most recent attack was announced yet again by ‘ocminer,’ by leveraging a similar attack vector as the previous the malicious party was able to repeat the timewarp attack across two of the coins mining algorithms. In a post on Bitcointalk he revealed:“Since nothing really was done about the previous attacks (only a band-aid), the attackers now simply use two algos to fork the chain for their own use and are gaining millions.”While it is unclear whether or not the perpetrators of the attack are the same as the last, what is clear is that currently 35 million XVG coins have been minted on the Scrypt and lyra2re algorithms ahead of schedule, causing mining difficulty to plummet and the currencies price to decline steeply.Verge’s Official Statement Remains Tight-LippedThe Verge official Twitter account has attributed the most recent hack to a “DDOS” attack on official mining pools. However, in light of teams track record and lack any supporting documentation, such a story is incomplete at best.We had a small hash attack that lasted about 3 hours earlier this morning, it's been cleared up now. We will be implementing even more redundancy checks for things of this nature in the future! $XVG #vergefam— vergecurrency (@vergecurrency) April 4, 2018With this most recent attack being the second in as many months, many in the wider crypto cryptocurrency community have voiced their concerns about the security of the network, drawing criticism from Litecoin’s own Charlie Lee:Verge mining is being exploited again. Someone has 51% attacked and taken over the Verge network again. PornHub transactions are being reversed! 😂Using 5 mining algorithms actually made it much worse. This is a great blog explaining what's happening: https://t.co/euf76UdDHN— Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) May 22, 2018While the first attack was quickly overshadowed by Verge’s announcement of their partnership with Pornhub, the worlds largest adult streaming platform, the most recent debacle has left many questioning the credentials of teams lead developers.Cryptocurrency continues to present itself as a target for hackers and malicious parties. As the market continues to develop, experimental platforms will need to ensure developers continue to err on the side of caution to ensure the safety of the users and the integrity of the blockchain.For more information on Verge, including technical information and price, see our Verge coin profile.Posted In: Altcoins, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
538,CryptoSlate,United Nations Office for Project Services Announces Collaboration with IOTA,Jonnie Emsley,1527075720.0,"In a joint venture to bring “transparency and efficiency” to the work of the United Nations, IOTA has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Office for Project Services. “Shared 🌍 problems require shared 🌍 solutions.” We've partnered w/ @iotatoken to explore how innovative data management tech can enhance the efficiency of humanitarian & development operations. | #distributedledger https://t.co/GHbbB2Pm9d— UNOPS (@UNOPS) May 22, 2018Operating across more than 80 countries, UNOPS has a stated interest in using IOTA’s DAG-based ledger to optimize its efforts in global peace, security, humanitarianism, and development.Who is UNOPS?The United Nations Office for Project Services is an operational arm of the United Nations, dedicated to implementing projects for the United Nations System, international financial institutions, governments and other partners around the worldA central operational arm of the United Nations, UNOPS is a self-financed subsidiary offering project management, human resources, procurement, infrastructure and financial management services to the UN.Regularly liaising with the World Bank, United Nations Development Program, and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the collaboration could be a significant milestone for the Germany-based IOTA.In a bipartisan press release, both parties explained how IOTA’s technology would economize the administration of UN documents, real-time transactional payments, and supply chains.While the news is a plainly positive sentiment-booster for IOTA, bulls would appear indifferent to the collaboration. Amidst late May’s sub-$8000 BTC price, IOTA’s value seems, in fact, to have declined since the announcement’s outbreak.Why IOTA?Aiming to become the “backbone” standardized ledger for the Internet of Things (IoT), IOTA facilitates transactions between the world’s 8.4 billion interconnected devices (according to a research report by Gartner).IOTA is focused on being useful for the emerging machine-to-machine (m2m) economy of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), data integrity, micro-/nano- payments, and other applications where a scalable decentralized system is warranted.Pointing to the scalability, security and cost-related issues of blockchain technology — currently limited to thousands of transactions per second — IOTA offers its ‘Tangle’ as the solution to accommodate the high transactional rate of IoT devices.Where a blockchain’s transaction time is generally limited by block creation and confirmation time, IOTA’s blockless architecture permits parallelized issuance of transactions — permitting a “significantly higher transaction throughput” according to IOTA.Yoshiyuki Yamamoto — UNOPS Special Advisor on Blockchain — explained how IOTA’s suitability to the IoT could be advantageous to the United Nations:“We share a vision where machines, devices, sensors and people connect and communicate to each other – it’s the world of ‘Industry 4.0.’ Harnessing technology that allows for these processes to work simultaneously, without the need for intermediaries, will help expedite our mission as an organization.”Such remarks seem to coalesce organically with the IOTA Foundation — an open-source not-for-profit bent on propagating the “ecosystem behind the economy of things.” Mirroring Yamamoto’s vision, IOTA Co-Founder David Sonstebo noted:“Shared global problems require shared global solutions. With our open-source, permission-less innovation approach, IOTA’s distributed ledger technology lends itself uniquely to this kind of cooperative problem-solving.”Where most may associate the IoT with markedly corporate projects,  the United Nations’ expression of interest would appear a decided indicator of the industry’s significance. Delivering $1.8 billion of spending in 2017 alone, the UNOPS’ scope of the project could certainly lend IOTA’s vision of “the connected world” a weighty push.For more information on IOTA including technical information, news, price, and exchanges where it is traded, please see our IOTA coin profile.Posted In: IOTA, Adoption, Altcoins, Partnerships     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

540,CryptoSlate,Ex-CEO of Visa Takes the Wheel at Crypterium,Jonnie Emsley,1526895780.0,"A former CEO of Visa, Marc O’Brien, has been appointed Chief Executive of Crypterium — a crypto mobile payments solution.This has been an eventful week! #Crypterium, the world's first cryptobank, is now led by a legendary fintech entrepreneur Marc O'Brien, our website has got a facelift, and the App has been updated with numerous improvements. https://t.co/Ywkt1WGLeQ— Crypterium (@crypterium) May 19, 2018Crypterium to see consumers spend cryptocurrency as they would fiat, the post-ICO startup is building a mobile “Cryptobank” for everyday purchases of fiat-based goods and services — which they believe is “enabling cryptocurrency to go mainstream.”After completing their ICO in January 2018, Crypterium joins a growing list of payments solutions providers for cryptocurrency — such as Dinero, Monaco, or the LitePay.The appointment of O’Brien — a former CEO of Visa and a previous advisor to Mastercard — may be seen by many as a victory for the Estonian-based startup.With 25 years of experience in the FinTech, RegTech, and Finance industries,  O’Brien’s first labor as Crypterium CEO will be launching the Crypterium’s mobile payments application.Crypterium’s flagship application is intended to instantly convert a user’s assets into fiat — making it useful for spending in-store via Point of Sale terminals or QR codes, shopping online, paying bills, or cross-border payments.At the nucleus of this system is Crypterium’s “virtual card” — which will link to pre-existing digital payment solutions such as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay. To realize this goal, Crypterium will presumably leverage O’Brien’s dealings in electronic payments.Alongside the addition of Litecoin support for their app, Crypterium’s CRPT appears to have gathered steam at the prospect of O’Brien’s leadership, witnessing a series of rallies following the announcement.Cryptofkrz presents the #COTD for 05/12/2018.

I strongly believe that cryptocurrency is about to go mainstream and we can be pioneers to build Crypterium into a terrific business”Yet historically, such infrastructure struggled to solve the issue of cryptocurrency volatility — a thorn in the side of existing payment solutions.While Crypterium claims to have engineered a means to nullify rapid price fluctuations, they appear to be keeping it closely-guarded— O’Brien describing it to Business Insider as the company’s “secret sauce”.Cryptocurrency: The Future of Finance?Related Story: Blockchain and Cryptocurrency in the Year 2020For many, O’Brien’s appointment will likely be a psychological win in an era filled with Fear Uncertainty & Doubt (FUD). Once a marginal technology, blockchain continues to garner steady institutional interest — in this particular case from an ex-head of the world’s leading payments provider.Whether O’Brien lends Crypterium enough punch to succeed, or fall short, this addition to the blockchain industry sends a clear message about the consistent institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate means of payment.Posted In: Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
541,CryptoSlate,0x V2 Update to Support Ethereum ERC-721 Token Swaps,Peter Ivancic,1526872920.0,"The decentralized exchange protocol, 0x, announced a significant update in the form of V2. With a projected launch of July, the newest version brings some exciting features for trading tokenized assets.The Ethereum-based protocol acts as a communication layer for DEXs, known as decentralized exchanges, to facilitate a standardized trustless P2P token exchange layer without the need of a third party. In light of the Mt Gox and HitBTC hacks, the need for dApp-based open source exchange protocols is more apparent than ever.Open Standards for All ExchangesRelated Story: An Introduction to 0x: The Protocol for Trading TokensThe 0x protocol brings a level of industry standardization to exchanges unseen in the current climate. By creating a standardized protocol for exchanges to operate on, 0x essentially provides the ability for anybody with the prerequisite resources to create an entirely new decentralized exchange platform for themselves.0x offers a novel solution to the problem of illiquidity amongst exchanges. Since all cooperating exchanges using the 0x protocol operate on the same infrastructure, the network provides networked liquidity that would not be possible with all entities using proprietary exchange software.Introducing 0x v2.0: The protocol for trading everythinghttps://t.co/CNCfgyY0Gk— 0x (@0xProject) May 15, 2018The protocol operates as a series of smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet, with the first deployed in August 2017. Current there exist 15 layers 0x relayers, the protocols name for supported DEXs, consisting of big names such as Augur, Maker and Request Network.The recent trend of tokenized non-fungible assets, such as the collectible tokenized assets of CryptoKittes and EtherCraft lead the 0x protocol to provide the exchange of such assets through the ERC-721 standard. 0x allows for the transfer of not just currency but also tokenized assets like securities, derivatives and other tradeable unique tokens.New Standards for Collectable AssetsWhile version 1.0 of the 0x protocol focused primarily on the burgeoning ERC-20 token ecosystem, the latest update has placed a significant focus on the economy of unique collectible assets.To help the community effectively communicate with developers about the upcoming standard, 0x has taken feedback from the recent ETHDenver meeting in combination with the discussion in the EIP-721 GitHub and created the site ERC721.org to aggregate all relevant information on the subject.To help facilitate the new standard and streamline the exchange protocol for other later updates, 0x has revised its proxy contract into Asset Proxies, enabling users to deploy a new proxy contract for each unique asset type.Asset Proxies allow 0x to support future token standards without having to redeploy a single proxy, thereby creating a modular architecture for the protocol.The 0x protocol framework0x version 2.0 also brings support for new signature types, expanding beyond Ethereum ECDSA scheme allowing the exchange to support EIP-712, Trezor and will provide users the ability to define their verification functions within smart contracts.This enables orders to be created using multi-sig, ring signatures, BLS or any other encryption scheme and doesn’t require future redeployment to support new use cases.The 0x team has continued to iterate and build upon its core product and incorporate community suggestions to provide a much-needed service for the blockchain ecosystem. The project has carefully considered the changing landscape of digitized assets and adapted to suit. The 0x project looks to be a valuable tool in the helping to provide a reliable and secure exchange networked exchange platforms.Posted In: Altcoins, Derivatives, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

The public alpha will see which 100 public testers receive bounties for identifying issues in order to improve the VeChain project.The upcoming public beta may be the first time that the VeChain code base is available to the public, but the new white paper release provides cryptocurrency market participants with a deep insight into the vision of the project and the manner in which the VeChain foundation plans achieve it.Public blockchain projects, according to the VeChain foundation, lack four key elements — a proper governance model, efficient economic models, regulation and compliance capabilities, and a multidisciplinary approach to the implementation of new technology. The core focus of the VeChain development team, according to the release, is the creation of new, more effective business models in blockchain:“The biggest challenge the VeChain team has been facing during the use cases development and implementation in the past two years is not the technical concerns, but the business consensus of how to achieve new business models.”New Partnerships, Governmental AdoptionThe new development plan highlights the progress VeChain is making in forging industry partnerships and accelerating adoption, noting an upcoming BMW partnership announcement. VeChain’s BMW partnership was confirmed by CEO Sunny Lu earlier this year, but an official announcement from the automotive giant is likely to capture a significant amount of investor interest.“BMW, as our new partner, is building up another solution on VeChainThor platform. More details will be announced directly from BMW later once it is ready to go.”Also covered in the release is a collaborative effort between PwC, China Unicom, and Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Sciences in order to develop a blockchain-based cloud project that will assist with China’s Agricultural Cultivation Management Plan.Other partnerships covered in the development plan and white paper include detailed insights into VeChains food and beverage industry digital assurance solution created in tandem with MyStory, which will see the VeChainThor blockchain and hardware tags used in the Italian wine industry.First ICO Set to Launch on VeChainThorVeChain’s whitepaper release follows the recent announcement of the first initial coin offering on the VeChainThor blockchain. Plair, a blockchain-based gaming media platform, will launch a private sale of VET tokens issued on the VeChainThor blockchain on May 25.Patrick Tang, the CEO of Plair Foundation, commented on ICO in a Medium announcement post:“VeChain brings to the table a powerful combination of professional advice, resources and community backing that is needed as a premium blockchain partner. We are excited to work together to pioneer a way to better serve gaming enthusiasts.”Market response to the white paper release has seen the token recapture lost ground, rising from $4.23 to $4.52 in a positive price swing. With an official BMW partnership announcement in the works, the token holds strong potential to break out of its position as 16th highest crypto by market cap.VET 24-hour performancePosted In: VeChain, China, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

The similarities between the new placeholder token name and Syscoin, a blockchain-based marketplace, were quickly pointed out by the crypto community — Syscoin’s native token is “SYS” — alerting the easily-spooked crypto market.Name Change Will Not Affect EOS TokenConcerns regarding the name change are unfounded, however, according to Roshan Abraham of EOS block production candidate EOS Authority. The name change, states Abraham, is a single line change intended specifically for block producers which will be changed before use, and is intended to ensure legal compliance:“This change won’t affect the public. Block One can’t be seen as launching the chain. So, us block producers like EOS Authority will have to launch the chain and use EOS as token. Block producers will install (the) code and change line 184 from SYS to EOS. SYS is just a default for system. That’s all.”Minor FUD caused by the misunderstood update doesn’t appear to have affected the positive momentum captured by EOS in the past 24 hours, however — after a brief drop to $12.32, EOS has recaptured lost ground and broken through the $13 level.EOS 24-hour performanceRanking in as the fifth highest crypto on the market cap leaderboard, EOS boasts a market cap of over $11 billion. With the EOS mainnet launch scheduled for June 2nd and regular development updates, EOS demonstrates strong potential to capture further ground should positive sentiment hold.Posted In: EOS, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

With over 200 million daily active users, LINE’s integration into the ICX blockchain ecosystem will be a huge benefit to the South Korean network.I just published “Joint Venture between ICON and LINE: ‘Unchain’” https://t.co/3xpHhuWl38— ICON (@helloiconworld) May 15, 2018Blockchain Solutions UnchainedUnchain was formed earlier in the year as a subsidiary of LINE, tasked with researching and developing a Dapp ecosystem that will synergize with the platform.Related Story: ICON News Roundup: ICX Maintains Steady Growth as Industry Adoption IncreasesAlongside the official partnership ICON’s technical director, H.K Lee has been appointed as Unchain’s CEO providing the team with experience in both blockchain and artificial intelligence.These types of long-term partnership and joint-ventures between blockchain projects and industry leading conglomerates demonstrate a concerted shift in the online services market.By collaborating with such a ubiquitous social platform, ICON has the potential to be a part of people’s daily internet interaction, the team is aware of just how important this type of consistent growth is stating:“ICON and Unblock, a subsidiary of LINE dedicated to blockchain research and to accelerate DApp projects, will be integrated with Unchain. This joint venture takes blockchain and decentralization another step closer to being a part of our everyday lives.”LINE operates one of the world’s most popular internet platforms, providing a wide variety of different services including taxis, food delivery, antivirus, news, advertising, payment systems, manga subscription services, as well as music and video streaming services.While the platform’s penetration into western markets has remained limited, within Asia it occupies a unique space as a cultural institution of the like of Twitter or Facebook.By integrating a tokenized ecosystem into LINEs plethora of online services users will be able to utilize ICONs hyper-connected blockchain in order to provide reliable, scalable solutions to further expand the functionality of LINEs digital marketplace.LINE Provides a Portal for Daily dApp ExperienceExactly to what extent LINE plans to integrate blockchain into its platform remains unclear, with the many varied internet services provided by the LINE ecosystem, ICX may see a direct integration as the token fueling the platform, or operate as an intermediary layer for users to interact with multiple service based tokens that use ICON’s DEX to transact between.With many coins struggling to find widespread adoption and crypto enthusiasts begin to express concerns over markets evaluation when compared to regular substantial usage, ICON has secured itself an important foothold in providing a high-traffic user base.

546,CryptoSlate,Monero Community Calls for Changelly Boycott,Peter Ivancic,1526536800.0,"Users of the popular privacy-focused coin Monero have taken to Reddit in outrage over Changelly implementation of Know Your Customer regulations, publicly announcing the exchange should be boycotted.While KYC has become the common standard for anti-money laundering and customer risk management processes for many cryptocurrency exchanges, Changelly’s recent implementation has left many users frustrated by its targeted procedure.Started in 2013 as a startup by a team from MinerGate, an early Bitcoin mining pool, the site allows customers to easily and rapidly exchange cryptocurrencies through a trading algorithm.This bot provides users with the best rate via integration through reputable exchanges like Binance, Bittrex, Poloniex, and HitBTC. Changelly operates its headquarters in Prague and is therefore subject to the European laws requiring them to be in compliance with anti-money laundering regulations.Site Documentation Neglects to Mention ComplianceChangelly has garnered a reputation within the cryptocurrency community as being a hassle-free and easy-to-use exchange platform, only requiring users to create an account with email verification to use their platform.The site makes no mention within its FAQs, Privacy Policy or Terms of Use of KYC or AML regulations, only mentioning the possibility of compliance in the form of a tick box directly prior to completing a transaction.While Changelly states the need for customers to provide supporting documents, the key supposition of ‘if’ means that only transaction suspected of being linked to violations of such AML regulations will be required to provide KYC supporting documentation.Exactly how Changelly qualifies these transactions as being potentially fraudulent remains undefined, the issue has been documented by Reddit users across multiple cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, OMG, and XMR.Changelly Places Itself in Awkward PositionThe main issue with Changelly’s implementation of KYC is that in terms of UX design and information flow, the process leaves the exchange holding all the cards. Changelly has clearly stated that users’ transactions will be processed after providing supporting documents, however, should a user not want to provide said documents, returning the exact funds transacted would violate AML regulations.As Changelly uses an API to immediately transact users funds via a host of other exchanges, refunding a users transaction would mean returning coins bought on the open market, in effect laundering possibly fraudulent coins.Changelly’s customer service team has attempted to mitigate community blacklash by taking to Reddit in order to individually and publicly address users with concerns about their platforms requirements.In addition to targeting large transactions and privacy coins, Changelly actively scans users send and receive addresses and compares them to blacklisted wallets that it claims is shared amongst large cryptocurrency services.Comment from discussion changelly_com’s comment from discussion ""High Risk: changelly steals my 3.3BTC ($30k USD)"".Due to lag in regulation for the cryptocurrency space and lack of a strict KYC framework in requiring KYC across all transactions, Changelly has placed its customers in a difficult position.The company continues to work with customers on a case by case basis to resolve any issues, however, to prevent further confusion and ambiguities, minor clarification within the sites interfaces in tandem with transparent AML qualifications may be in order.Posted In: Monero, Altcoins, KYC, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
547,CryptoSlate,Stratis Unveils Alpha Release of C# Smart Contracts,Jonnie Emsley,1526517360.0,"Stratis has unveiled the alpha version of their C# Stratis Smart Contract, taking the company closer to its vision of being the business-friendly blockchain for smart contracts.Aiming to make blockchain easier for enterprises, Stratis is built in C# on the .NET framework — permitting developers to build smart contracts in one of the world’s benchmark programming languages.Stratis | Smart Contracts in C# alpha release https://t.co/pEshGZOTXZ via @YouTube— Stratisplatform (@stratisplatform) May 16, 2018According to Stratis, this will enable enterprise adoption of blockchain en masse, allowing the seamless integration of their product into existing architectures. Their announcement noted:“This makes it easier to integrate into existing enterprise architectures than other platforms, Stratis Smart Contracts in C# opens many doors previously blocked due to computing language barriers.”War of the Smart Contracts?Ethereum has enjoyed a first-mover advantage in being the first blockchain to implement smart contracts, which demand its programming language, Solidity — since appropriated by a number of blockchains including QTUM, Rootstock, and UBIQ.Stratis is a powerful and flexible Blockchain Development Platform designed for the needs of real-world enterprise and financial services.While Ethereum’s smart contract arguably popularized the notion of the technology — first conceptualized by Nick Szabo in 1994 — competitors have pointed to the young Solidity as being a barrier to entry for developers, who must learn an entirely new scripting language to write Ethereum smart contracts.In the increasingly-crowded space of smart contract platforms, the criticism of Solidity seems to be a popular selling point. There’s Lisk, who use Javascript — describing it as “undeniably the language of the internet” or Stratis, who note:“Several other blockchain companies have launched smart contracts offerings, but required development in an entirely different programming language or a new digital ecosystem with new languages, decompilers and integrated development environments (IDEs).”In this vein, Stratis uses C# to market their platform as the developer-friendly solution for businesses. Chris Trew, Stratis CEO offered:“Our foundation in C# and .NET programming broadens the world of smart contracts immediately, and we look forward to seeing what people do with it.”While C# may indeed lower the barrier to entry for those foreign to Solidity, Stratis faces a number of competitors in the smart contract space, such as NEM, Lisk or EOS — all of whom tote their respective programming language as being the most agreeable.This may explain why Stratis appears to be diversifying, offering a range of products alongside its C# smart contract — stating they will soon support F# — a functional programming language favored in the financial and scientific sectors.Finally, early May 2018 saw the release of the Stratis ICO Platform — a fee-less ecosystem designed to streamline the process of launching an ICO.As Stratis joins the heated race of smart contract providers, the response of the world’s significant C# development community may prove pivotal to the project’s adoption.Posted In: Altcoins, Enterprise, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
548,CryptoSlate,Zcash Overshadows Bitcoin After Listing on Gemini Exchange,Jonathan Kim,1526468280.0,"A truly innovative privacy coin, Zcash has announced it will be available to trade on the Gemini Exchange on May 22. The famed Winklevoss twins founded trading platform will be the first licensed Zcash exchange in the world.Zcash v. BitcoinAlthough Zcash is a fork off of the Bitcoin source code, there are several features that distinguish it from its parent coin.As described by Eric Winer, VP of Engineering at Gemini, the Zcash blockchain uses:“zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (or “zero-knowledge proofs”)… that offers confidentiality for peer-to-peer transactions similar to those afforded to fiat currency transfers.”Unlike Bitcoin, the rising privacy-focused cryptocurrency uses cutting-edge encryptions to prevent prying eyes from tracking the source and destination of flowing transactions.This solution to the lacking privacy of bitcoin serves to create a more user-friendly digital currency for secure daily transactions.In an interview with Forbes, President of Gemini Exchange, Cameron Winklevoss summarized the two coins’ primary distinctions by stating:“Bitcoin and Zcash are two revolutionary technologies vying for different mantles, Bitcoin being digital gold and Zcash being digital cash.”Gemini Finds Peace with RegulationGemini is a digital currency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins in 2015.A rigorous and stringent regulatory body, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) does not easily allow for licensed cryptocurrency trading or the authorization of virtual currency exchanges.However, it is becoming evident that institutional and regulatory sentiment are changing tides.In a recent press release, NYDFS made clear their effort to embrace “emerging cryptocurrencies” when DFS Superintendent Maria T. Vullo stated:“This action continues New York’s longstanding commitment to innovation and leadership in the global marketplace. With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving.”Obtaining authorization for the Gemini Trust Company in 2015, bitcoin billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have formed a friendly relationship with the NYDFS and expressed excitement over their newly granted licenses:“We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash.”In addition, the press release revealed that Gemini Exchange “has also been approved for potential future offerings of Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.”Zcash Prices RiseRelated Story: NYSE Parent Company May Be Launching a Bitcoin Investment PlatformFollowing the announcement to list on the Gemini Exchange, Zcash saw a strong uptrend in prices from $247 to $364 USD – a 47% increase in value. Although a much larger coin by market cap, bitcoin saw a 3.6% dip from $8854 to $8530 USD at the same time of Zcash’s Gemini listing announcement on Tuesday.Zcash rose from $249 to $377 after the Gemini announcement.Starting on May 22 at 9:30 am EST, Gemini Exchange will unveil Zcash trading to the public as the first licensed exchange to do so.Zcash is currently ranked 21 in the world’s top cryptocurrencies and has a market capitalization of $1.41 billion USD.Posted In: Zcash, New York, Altcoins, Exchanges, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
549,CryptoSlate,Stellar Joins Forces With IBM to Bring Carbon Credits to the Blockchain,Sam Town,1526353740.0,"A new partnership between IBM and carbon credits startup Veridium Labs Ltd will see carbon credits issued on the Stellar blockchain, streamlining the trade of carbon offset credits in an open market.The most obvious application of distributed ledger technology may be as a method of storing and transferring monetary value, but the use cases of the blockchain extend far beyond cryptocurrency, allowing for the transfer and management of virtually any kind of value.Veridium to Use IBM Blockchain Technology to Create Social and Environmental Impact Tokens. IBM’s engagement with Veridium will mark the first public IBM involvement in a token issuance on public network.#Consensus2018 #IBM   #BlockchainWeekNYC https://t.co/LMjittKRcI— Veridium Labs (@VeridiumLabs) May 15, 2018Carbon credits are currently used to mitigate the growth in concentrations of greenhouse gases by allowing organizations to trade certificates or permits that represent the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.Related Story: IBM Predicts Countries Will Embrace CryptoMore complex credits, however, don’t have a simple set value, which makes it difficult to assess their value, and virtually impossible to trade on open exchanges.The new partnership between Veridium Labs and IBM, however, is set to transform the carbon credit market by using Stellar-based IBM blockchain technology, using blockchain technology to manage the process of carbon footprint accounting and offsetting.Carbon Credits Tokens Issued on Stellar BlockchainThe partnership, announced in a press release on May 15th, aims to create a new type of fungible digital asset that uses a formula created by Veridium in order to establish the value of each carbon credit token. The Stellar blockchain will function as the ledger upon which tokens are stored and transacted, while IBM will manage trade activity.Todd Lemons, the CEO & Co-Founder of Veridium, commented on the importance of streamlining the carbon credit tracking and trading process:“For years, we’ve been trying to mitigate environmental impacts at every point in the value chain, however previous solutions still presented significant complexities and costs. Our work with IBM is the first step in dramatically simplifying the accounting and offsetting processes, and therefore ultimately helping reduce costs”According to Lemons, environmental assets such as carbon credits are potentially under-utilized due to the complexity and difficulty associated with their use and trade. The new carbon credit token solution, states Lemons, delivers a range of benefits to both enterprise organizations and investors:“Our digital environmental assets are designed to help companies and institutional investors purchase and use carbon credits to mitigate their environmental impacts today, and even hedge their potential carbon liabilities risks in the future.”By tokenizing carbon credits, the Viridium solution created in tandem with IBM and Stellar allows organizations to purchased tokenized Triple Gold REDD+ credits, which are created by InfiniteEARTH using a carbon accounting methodology that is now embodied in the UN Paris Climate Agreement.While the new carbon credit token may not offer market speculators the opportunity to cash in, it does represent a real-world application of blockchain technology that delivers demonstrable positive real-world environmental benefits. Bridget van Kralingen, the Senior Vice President, IBM Industry Platforms and Blockchain, emphasizes how blockchain technology can simultaneously improve efficiency and deliver societal benefits:“By using a public, permissioned blockchain network, we can help Veridium create a new sustainable marketplace that is good for business and good for the world”Posted In: Stellar, Adoption, Altcoins, Enterprise, Partnerships     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

Congrats @BrendanBlumer Big day. https://t.co/At49A8Frss— Michael Novogratz (@novogratz) May 14, 2018The Sydney Morning Herald announced on the 14th of May that Jesudason had resigned, stating that new chief executive Matt Comyn is currently undertaking an internal and external search for a replacement, taking over the role of CFO in a temporary capacity while Commonwealth Bank attempts to repair the reputation of the bank, which has recently been embroiled in a scandal that involves the breaching of money laundering and terrorism financing laws and financial misconduct.Jesudason’s move is one of the first high-profile movements of key finance industry personnel into the blockchain ecosystem. Working with Block.one, Jesudason will take the new role of Chief Operating Officer, serving on the EOS project’s Board of Directors and functioning as the Group President.Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer commented on the move:“Rob has a proven track record of success in global financial services, where he has been involved in industry innovation and facilitated regulatory advancement enabling the adoption of new technologies. His alignment with our organizational priorities of creating compliant, high-performance blockchain solutions, is an ideal fit for Block.one, and is an exciting conclusion to our thorough search for the right individual.”Blockchain Industry Captures Finance LeadersJesudason isn’t the only high-ranking finance industry board member to move from the traditional finance ecosystem to the blockchain environment, however. Newly-appointed Goldman Sachs Vice President Chris Matta recently quit his role with the organization, lasting just two days in his new position after a promotion before abandoning the traditional finance industry to create a new investment vehicle within the blockchain space.Matta commented on the move in a recent CNBC interview:“In the crypto world, every month is like a year in the equities space. The amount of things that would change in that time, the number of funds that would come to market, it would just be a much more difficult landscape for us if we were trying to get things up and running in February.”While Matta may hold an apparent bullish perspective on the future of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, he’s decidedly terse regarding the potential of a dramatic price run-up in the near future:“It’s either going to zero, or it’s going magnitudes higher.”Posted In: EOS, Australia, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

552,CryptoSlate,Zilliqa (ZIL) Update: Up 190% Over Past Month on Testnet Launch and Exchange Listings,Austin Tuwiner,1526180220.0,"Zilliqa’s price continues to increase after the successful launch of its testnet and addition of new exchange listings. It is currently ranked the twenty-third largest coin by market cap according to coin rankings, with a market cap of $1.3 billion.What is Zilliqa?Zilliqa is a public, open source blockchain platform that scales transactions linearly through the use of sharding. According to the Zilliqa whitepaper, if the current 30,000+ Ethereum miners moved over to Zilliqa, its blockchain could support over 1000x the transaction capacity.Zilliqa utilizes proof of work in order to establish mining identities but performs consensus checks at a much more local level with sharding.The team states that they are using proof of work due to it being much more studied and documented then the recent popular alternative proof of stake.If something scales linearly, that means that it directly scales proportionally to its size. In the case of Zilliqa, each active miner adds to the maximum output of the blockchain.Linear scaling is an almost unseen feature and is able to occur through sharding, which makes it so mining operations can occur in parallel. Most cryptocurrencies see a decrease in throughput as size increases, but not Zilliqa.For example, if Zilliqa has 8000 miners, it will automatically create ten sub-networks of 800 miners each. This split occurs in a decentralized manner without the need of a central authority.Sharding will not only lead to an increased amount of supported transactions but also allows for cheap near instant transactions.Genaro and Bluzelle PartnershipZilliqa recently partnered with Genaro and Bluzelle, allowing future dApp creators to use either as a backend storage provider. Genaro and Bluezelle are very similar, allowing users with extra storage space to store information used dApps. In return for the storage space, storage providers receive tokens.These partnerships will allow Zilliqa’s applications to scale even more through the use of decentralized storage.ScillaAnother possible reason for Zillia’s massive price increase is the anticipated launch of Scilla, a new smart contract language created by the Zilliqa team. The first version of the language is being revealed at a Zilliqa event in Singapore on May 23, 2018.Scilla has several key differences from Solidity, Ethereum’s smart contract language. In Scilla, an objects state and behavior are separated, allowing the language to be more flexible in its functions.Test NetworkThe Zilliqa team launched the first version of the testnet, where users can test the features of the project. The testnet is currently seeing thousands of transactions per second compared to Bitcoin’s 7, and Ethereum’s 20.Zilliqa Near Term RoadmapIn order put this into perspective, payment processor Visa processes up to 24,000 transactions a second. While the amount of transactions Visa supports is impressive, that number comes with the drawback of centralization.Zilliqa is currently an ERC20 token, meaning it runs on top of Ethereum but plans to launch it’s mainnet in Q2 2018. Upon mainnet launch, Zilliqa ERC20 token holders can swap their tokens for mainnet Zilliqa at a 1:1 ratio. Do not send any ERC20 Zilliqa tokens to the projects Testnet or they will be unrecoverable.Zilliqa Exchange ListingsIn addition to its Q1 Testnet V1 and Smart Contract Alpha release, Zilliqa saw exchange additions to Binance, Upbit, and Bithumb.We are happy to announce that #Zilliqa #ZILs will be available for trading on @UPbitExchange— Zilliqa (@zilliqa) May 10, 2018ConclusionFor cryptocurrencies to see increased adoption, they need to be able to support a much more considerable amount of transactions. Zilliqa’s use of sharding allows linear scaling, allowing it to compete with current payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard.To learn more about Zilliqa, including its current price, market cap, trading volume and technical information, see its coin profile.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

We will open the doors to a new cryptocurrency stage focused on scaling and commercialization, providing next generation infrastructure and express lanes needed for global dApp development.”The Future of TronFrom Jun 1-24 following the mainnet launch, TRON will undergo a test phase to prepare for the genesis block of the official mainnet launch on June 25.On June 26, 27 select Super Representatives will vote on 30 million TRON users’ behalf in an election to determine the future of the network’s governance structure.As the vanguards to the mainnet platform, 20 startup teams will be building on the new dApp ecosystem and publish their “apps for desktop, website, hot/cold wallets for mobile, and blockchain explorers” by June 5th.In realizing their initial and ambitious goal to create a truly decentralized internet, TRON is making solid strides. Expressing his optimism for the future of TRON, Justin Sun ended his announcement by saying:“The road ahead is a long one, but we will achieve our goals one step at a time. 2018 is just the beginning.”Posted In: Tron, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
555,CryptoSlate,"Kin Plans to Keep Ethereum Token, But Fork Stellar Blockchain To Avoid Scalability Issues",Shiraz Jagati,1525918260.0,"Developers of Kin, the altcoin that facilitates transactions within the Kik ecosystem, are planning a fork from Stellar to steer clear of potential issues of scalability and high transaction fees.Kin is a decentralized ecosystem of digital services for daily life, for use on the Kik platform.Kin was originally developed as an ERC20 token, but as time progressed, developers soon realized the limitations of the Ethereum blockchain in relation to its scalability and transaction speeds.In a statement made by Ted Livingston, Founder and CEO of Kik, he made it abundantly clear that “Kin needs to be scaled now”.Livingston went on to add:“Most crypto projects to date have been technology-driven first and product-driven second. Kin has always been the opposite. After working heads down alongside the best minds in the industry, we came to the conclusion that a hybrid solution of Ethereum and our own fork of Stellar would benefit the Kin Ecosystem both short and long-term.”Kin was conceived as a medium for facilitating customer buying and spending within the Kik platform. The parent organization overseeing the development of these tokens, The Kin Foundation, announced on Tuesday that it will fork Stellar to create its own unique blockchain.This new blockchain will be free from any kind of transaction charges and will be operated via permissioned nodes.About KikKik is a widely used smartphone messaging service that boasts of having over 300 million active users. When using Kik, customers can earn Kin tokens for making contributions to the native community which can then be spent in exchange for goods and services within the platform ecosystem.For example, the tokens can be exchanged for additional paid content, services and can even be used to compensate developers and content creators for their offerings.Also worth noting is that Kin succeeds a former currency, Kik Points, was launched in 2015 and was used within the popular messenger service for facilitating all internal transactions.What will the fork achieve?Currently, Kin adheres to the ERC20 token standard which seems to be the cause of some concern for the developers of these tokens. They are now re-considering the future of Kin in light of the Ethereum’s current scalability issues.While the developers of Kin had earlier planned to transition exclusively to the Stellar network, this approach was later refined and now the team has envisioned a two-chain system in which the Kin token would operate in parallel on both, the Stellar and Ethereum networks.However, Stellar is not free of its own problems and as per Nethanel Lev, the currency continues to face its own share of “business scalability” issues.Final ThoughtsKin is set to offer users with “bi-directional blockchain support” which means that consumer-facing applications will make use of the company’s proprietary Kin network instead of the one deployed by Stellar.In the words of Livingston:“Our goal is for Kin to be the most used cryptocurrency in the world, and this will help get us there sooner.”The end-goal for the company is to completely eliminate transaction fees on the Kin network and thus make microtransactions more streamlined and hassle-free for customers.Posted In: Stellar, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
556,CryptoSlate,Cardano Signs Agreement with Ethiopian Government to Introduce Blockchain Technology to Agritech,Aliesha Duffin,1525691640.0,"The Ethiopian government will be working with Cardano to see how blockchain technology can have a positive impact on the agritech industry. The project will have a strong focus on the countries main export – coffee beans. The goal is to increase transparency throughout the supply chain.On May 3rd, CEO and founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, tweeted that Cardano had just signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Ethiopian government. The MOU was signed at a blockchain forum held at the ministry of science and technology on May 3rd, 2018. The agreement will look at how Ethiopian developers will be able to apply blockchain technology in the countries agritech industry.Just signed an MOU with the Ethiopian Ministry of Science and Technology to explore training blockchain developers and use Cardano in the Agritech Industry pic.twitter.com/r06W0RSZye— Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) May 3, 2018The project will include training 100 local developers to use blockchain technology and they will also be trained in the Haskell programming language.Bitcoin Magazine reported that the Minister Getahun Mekuria Kuma said at the blockchain forum where the MOU was announced that he wants the first batch of students participating in the Haskell course to be women.“To promote and highlight the importance and participation of women in coding. The ideal applicant will be a recent graduate from an Ethiopian university with a computer science or related degree.”The Birthplace of CoffeeEthiopian coffee growersIt is believed that Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee, with reports of the Ethiopian nomadic people eating the red cherries for the stimulant effect, going back as far as the tenth century.Fast forward to today and coffee accounts for 22% of all of the countries exports. In the last fiscal year, Ethiopia made $866 million from the export of coffee.Unfortunately, the country is not seeing its fair share of the profits when it comes to coffee, and a lot of this is to do with the supply chain. Ninety-five percent of coffee that is grown in Ethiopia is from local farmers, but they are getting little return on their beans.Currently, it is difficult to prove the origin of coffee, and buyers are unwilling to pay more for beans when they don’t know where they have come from or what pesticides have been used.Related Story: Blockchain Is Transforming the Digital Landscape of AfricaThis is where blockchain technology has the potential to change the game for rural farmers and the Ethiopian coffee industry as a whole. By storing data on the blockchain, it would allow all participants in the supply chain to record, trace and track the coffee, from the local farmers to the wholesale buyers.Blockchain technology has the power to change supply chains across all industries, but in developing nations such as Ethiopia, it will hopefully help local farmers see an increased return on their hard labor. By proving the origins of the coffee as well as its purity, farmers will be able to sell their coffee for its actual worth and not at the current deflated price.Additionally, not only will the blockchain help to show the true origin of coffee but regulators will be able to gain insight about pesticides that may have been used in production.Minister Getahun Mekuria Kuma:“In Ethiopia, we have been working on the possibility of adopting blockchain for the marketing of agricultural products, especially for coffee.”Blockchain technology is being explored by a number of different countries in Africa with many people believing that it will help the countries that have long suffered financial instability and corruption.In Kenya, they are hoping to use the technology to help verify land ownership and the government of Uganda is planning to use blockchain technology to improve the efficiency in public service delivery.Posted In: Africa, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

558,CryptoSlate,Qtum May Update: Up 25% Over the Past Month On dApp Developments,Jonnie Emsley,1525433880.0,"Qtum has experienced a bullish past month of growth. The young project has exhibited a series of healthy leaps after the launch of its first-of-a-kind “cryptogame,” Heroes.Sitting just shy of a $2 billion market cap, Qtum has done remarkably well to slink under the radar of most — yet its recent performance would suggest this low-profile romance period is drawing to a close.Qtum is up 25% over the past month, having hit a high of $24.29 before currently dipping to $22.86.Qtum is a Chinese blockchain project that uses smart contracts and PoS 3.0.Firing off with an 18% hike in the final week of April, the 18th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap appears to be awakening from its slumber — Qtum raising the curtain on a series of promising installations including dApp-launches and game partnerships.What is Qtum?Blending the functionalities of Bitcoin and Ethereum, Qtum, or is an open-source blockchain designed to offer more secure smart contracts.A 2017 fork of the Bitcoin core protocol, Qtum’s architectural proposition is unique — offering the trustless peer-to-peer transaction of BTC — while emulating Ethereum’s smart contract and dApp functionality.Existentially, the Qtum Foundation would point to the significant failure of Ethereum smart contracts for validation of their mission — to leverage the proven usefulness of Ethereum, adding the esteemed security of Bitcoin.Clocking in at a 0.36% in a recent report, Ethereum’s smart contract failure rate may sound like small change to the layman. To businesses and institutions exchanging millions, on the other hand, any failure would be considered a cataclysmic failure.Armed with Bitcoin-friendly smart contracts, Qtum’s platform is the blockchain architect’s pipe dream — permitting dAapps to be written in a whole chorus of programming languages.Qtum HeroesIt seems that beneath Qtum’s corporate exterior there lies a touch of funk — the project venturing into the emerging ‘cryptogaming’ market with its first game, Heroes. A bloodthirsty gladiator game, Heroes, has broken new ground as the very first blockchain-based player vs. player game to date.Just find a hero looks like you!Qtum Heroes invitation registration launched!@QtumOfficial @PatrickXDai @MattLeeMA #Blockchain #QtumHeroeshttps://t.co/8CtObJHbMq— 777 (@Bingo_Platform) April 27, 2018Where pioneering crypto-games have revolved around the exchange of collectibles — such as the notoriously resource-intensive Cryptokitties — Heroes’ adversarial twist is a novel touch indeed — players claiming being rewarded in fully exchangeable crypto-assets for successfully slaying their opponent.Built by Mob Arts, the game may follow in the chasmic footsteps of the studio’s previous effort, House of Heroes — which saw prolific adoption amongst the burgeoning Asian market. Should Heroes become such a digital sensation, Qtum would enjoy a hearty step-up in users as potentially millions of people trade hands over virtual corpses.Bodhi: Qtum’s First Working DappBodhi Prediction Market, Qtum’s debuting testnet dApp, has once again broken ground for Qtum — with the launch of the very first working dApp on its mainnet.“Bodhi Prediction Market Platform Now Live on Qtum Mainnet” by @bodhitoken https://t.co/a6hxBDwLco— crypto_bodhi (@crypto__bodhi) April 25, 2018Currently, in its beta phase, the prophet-like Bodhi leverages public sentiment to predict future events; such as sports, politics, economic developments and anything that enters the public arena. As China’s Bodhi takes its baby steps, the project will invariably prove pivotal in boosting early adoption of the Singaporean blockchain, as players gleefully collect QTUM tokens from their vanquished foes.Qtum founder Patrick Dai noted:“We’re excited to have Bodhi lead the way by launching the first DApp on Qtum. Bodhi is serverless and runs on blockchain, it’s a real working decentralized application and that’s what this is all about.”Qtum: Time to Shine?Sporting a colossal market cap and bizarrely low profile, Qtum may befuddle western investors — who would ask how such a weighty offering could sneak unnoticed in a community that breathes virality. See, while Qtum’s proposition may be uniquely pragmatic, its team appears indifferent to popularizing the project’s western presence.Halal-Chain is a decentralized global monitoring solution for product safety and integrity.Where Qtum has been denied entrance to the hall of fame, it boasts an illustrious list of dApps scheduled for launch. Selections are eclectic, yet promising — from Datawallet’s data blockchain wallet to the more humanistic Halalchain — a government-affiliated project bringing relief and reassurance to the world’s 1+ billion Islamic population.The young Qtum’s unique architecture and impressive momentum are patently good omens — taking a series of strides since its 2017 mainnet debut. That said, the launch of Heroes is not exactly a step towards its earnest enterprise-grade focus per se — Qtum will surely need to assert this position to hold its own in the ruthlessly competitive top-20.Posted In: China, Adoption, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

This allows desynchronized and new users of the network to enter the blockchain without any previous knowledge of active participants or the history of the chain.Of all the papers IOHK Research has written, this one is the most significant. It's a major advancement for Proof of Stake https://t.co/QNIPonatF6 now PoS has nearly identical properties to PoW. https://t.co/zAP7dSxR3y Welcome to the age of Ouroboros Genesis— Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 26, 2018This development marks a huge advantage for the team, cementing the project as one the most secure and scalable smart contract capable blockchains on the market. This feature was previously one of the hallmarks of Proof of Work consensus algorithms, thought to be impossible for a Proof of Stake based network, Ouroboros’ implementation allows PoS to match the security guarantees of protocols like Bitcoin without needing to rely on resource-intensive mining equipment.Ouroboros Accepted as Entry for Eurocrypt 2018Cardano is a decentralized platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion. Cardano is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language.IOHK, the company responsible for the development of Cardano, has been invited to present Ouroboros at Eurocypt 2018 in order to share their findings with the wider cryptography community and gain insight by allowing the community to assist the project through the process of academic peer review.Presenting at such a prestigious academic event is a testament to the quality of the IOHK team’s research, allowing their code to be proofed and critiqued by industry experts. This process fits in line with the team’s goal of enabling development of the network within the accepted academic framework, an endeavor that distinguishes Cardano from the rest of the market.Ouroboros Praos, a novel proof-of-stake protocol designed by IOHK researchers is being presented this morning at #Eurocrypt2018 to a packed audience! #IOHK #Cardano #Ada @CardanoStiftung @cardanocom pic.twitter.com/nsuglC2Pek— Input Output (@InputOutputHK) May 1, 2018Cardano also recently announced the release of two testnet for the platform in the form of K-EVM and IELE. Firstly, K-EVM defines the formal semantics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine in the K framework. This release, set for May 28th, aims to “separate specification of analysis tools from the specification of particular programming languages or other models” allowing for a greater formalization of the EVM and providing developers more capable tools to analyze code.Secondly, IELE will provide developers with a collection of compiler and toolchain technologies based on the modular principles of LLVM. Much like LLVM, IELE is a register-based virtual machine and operates as the lowest layer of the Cardano Computation Layer.Testnet Releases Show Promise for Continued ProgressThe two testnets comprise parts of Cardano’s project Goguen milestone. This marks a major checkpoint for the project’s roadmap comprising of increased functionality within the platforms smart contracts that would allow for sidechains, support multiple currencies on a single ledger and see the rollout of Cardano’s general-purpose smart contract programming languages Plutus and Marlow.The IOHK April update reveals that engineering of the Plutus language is near completion alongside a Solidity to IELE translator and adaption of Ethereum Classics Mantis client. While this most recent announcement lacks detail, expect more information to be revealed soon as Cardano updates its roadmap.Related Story: Cardano (ADA) April Update: Up 53% Over Past Month On New Developments and Exchange ListingsIn recent months Cardano had continued to maintain strong support from the market, resulting in consistent supportive positive price action.The project’s audit from trusted third-party software developer FP Complete provided investors with assurance that the chain’s development process is being held accountable while listing on Huobi saw Chinese capital flow in via the Beijing based exchange.The combination of events and developments has resulted in a 150% rise in price over that past month, which could continue as the market continues to show strong support for projects that excel at the fundamentals.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
560,CryptoSlate,Request Network Partners With Wikimedia to Launch Blockchain-Powered Donations,Peter Ivancic,1525305840.0,"Request Network announced that it has partnered with Wikimedia Foundation to provide a transparent donation mechanism for one of the internet’s most popular websites.The request platform, called WooReq, is designed to be a flexible payment gateway to provide solutions for a range of financial applications. This ERC20 token aims to provide invoicing, direct payment, auditing, accounting, IoT payment frameworks and transparent spending ledgers.Bringing Blockchain to the Non-Profit SectorRequest is a decentralized network built on top of Ethereum, which allows anyone, anywhere to request a payment. The request can be detected and paid securely, without the need to involve a third party.Part of Request’s main proposition is the integration of localized trade law and legislation, allowing transacting parties to automatically negotiate any regulatory hurdles that may have otherwise interfered. These transactions all take place on an immutable, authenticated ledger which acts as a unique source of truth for accounting and auditing.Request‘s focus on transparent accounting services is particularly interesting, with the team targeting public budgeting of institutions such as city halls, governments and NGOs in a move that aligns with the agenda of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Bank.The team proposes a framework that would allow such institutions to adopt a convenient platform that would allow real-time auditing of public funds to foster accountability, integrity, and trust within official bodies.https://twitter.com/RequestNetwork/status/989776328701308928While the Request project may appear ambitious, the goals it intends to achieve are not without merit; Request has already seen partnerships from Price Waterhouse Cooper France and Francophone Africa in providing blockchain based financial solutions. This cooperation will see Request foundation in a leadership role, providing the companies and their clients with vital knowledge of the blockchain infrastructure and aiding them in “accelerating R&D and increasing adoption of real-world financial blockchain solutions.”With the recent news of Paypal’s implementation of higher transaction fees and debit charges, customers may be attracted to this kind of flexible, low-cost alternative. During the team’s most recent announcement, they also revealed integration with WooCommerce, a WordPress plugin for that provides easy e-commerce solutions.According to BuitWith, a prominent web technologies research company, the WooCommerce e-commerce platform accounts for 42% of the entire internet payment platform ecosystem.This announcement also unveiled Request Networks partnership with the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit and charitable organization that operates the Wikipedia online encyclopedia, alongside 14 other free knowledge projects. Wikipedia has been an integral part of the internet since its inception, allowing for a crowd-sourced knowledge repository that allows external sourcing and redistribution thought the Attribution and Share-alike Creative Commons licenses.Wikimedia Testing Waters Away From CoinbaseThe Wikimedia foundation depends mostly on donations and since 2014 has been accepting bitcoin donations through Coinbase, a third party payment provider that allows for direct conversion into USD.Request Network will provide the ability for users to contribute to the foundation with any digital currency, allowing complete real-time transparency of donor transactions without the possible interference of third parties.The French chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation is currently undergoing a pilot program to trial the platform before it is rolled out to the rest of the organization. Wikimedia has long been a proponent of maintaining an entirely transparent donation policy and will continue to further their efforts in providing an open donations platform stating:“Crypto-donations enabled by blockchain technology offer a guarantee of simplicity and trust for donors. The Blockchain technology offers a total and permanent visibility on the collected amount, which allows the Wikimedia Foundation to be as transparent as possible.”The announcement marks an enormous step forward for the Request Network, WooReq will cater to a massive audience by offering a free, open source crypto e-commerce plugin on one of the most popular website building platforms.The Wikimedia partnership offers a perfect testing ground for the team to complete systems that will function as an integral part of their transparent smart auditing mechanism. In tandem, these partnerships will provide the network with some much-needed traction and volume, allowing them to cement themselves as a leader in transparent blockchain financial solutions.Posted In: Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
561,CryptoSlate,ICON News Roundup: ICX Maintains Steady Growth as Industry Adoption Increases,Peter Ivancic,1525158000.0,"This Friday saw the first annual meeting of Korea’s Open Blockchain Industrial Association where ICON’s parent company, the Loop, attended talks alongside electronics industry giants such as SK Telecom, LG, and Hyundai as well as two of the countries largest banks, Sinhan and Hana.ICON foundation, the not-for-profit foundation that manages the ICON blockchain, was created by The Loop, which operates as a joint venture between three of Korea’s largest universities and DAYLI Intelligence. Consisting of over 25 separate companies, DAYLI Intelligence is Korea’s largest fintech holding company.An Interoperable Smart Contract Enabled SolutionICON is an interconnecting blockchain network. ICON can connect independent blockchains without the use of additional third-party intermediaries.While this union of companies and conglomerates may seem odd, it illustrates ICON’s goal to “hyperconnect the world.” The team looks to solve the current fragmentation in the blockchain market, acting as a universal language for all blockchains to communicate.ICON plans use their ICX token to act as the intermediary currency for all, negotiating exchange rates through a Decentralized Exchange Reserve to allow the token to be used on any blockchain.The project’s interoperability takes place on a layer referred to as Nexus. While this layer interacts with the ICON blockchain itself, it operates as a separate element that it is built upon the Loopchain enterprise blockchain.ICON, however, integrates a multi-channel structure comprised of the light clients of other blockchains, using Loopring’s own Loop Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism to reach a consensus between corresponding chains.Additionally, ICON’s support for smart contracts, sidechains, and dApps allow it to function as a self-sufficient entity. The recent New Kids on the Block(chain) demo day has already seen five such smart contracts developed using the Smart Contracts On Reliable Environment runtime container. These projects ranged from Blockchain integrated Real Estate Listing to fair Language Translation marketplaces, demonstrating the versatility of ICON smart contract platform.I just published “[Event sketch] Demo Day” https://t.co/gX0D9M8AAS— ICON (@helloiconworld) April 28, 2018ICON Helps to Solidify Koreans Blockchain FutureICON’s cooperation within the Korean Open Blockchain Industrial Association can thereby be seen as two-fold. Firstly, the ICON team can provide other industries with technical knowledge about blockchain infrastructure. Secondly, ICON’s involvement operates under the assumption that these companies would either want to build a blockchain on Loopchain alongside ICON or integrate their blockchain platform via the Nexus channel.Related Story: Pantera CEO Thinks Crypto Market Could Reach $40 Trillion, Reveals Large Stake in ICONThe ICX price has seen an increase recently over news that Pantera, a San Francisca-based blockchain investment fund, has made a large investment in ICX.Evidence of ICX tokens transferred to a Bittrex-owned ERC20 wallet has fuelled rumors that a potential Bittrex listing of the coin may be imminent, contributing to positive price movement.While no official announcement has been made from either ICON or Bittrex, the addition of yet another top ten exchange listing ICX would enable the token to further extend its reach, possibly leading to greater bullish price action.Investors Maintain Support for Dynamic Blockchain SolutionsThe South Korean Won remains the highest traded currency for ICX outside of BTC as the nation’s largest industries look towards the seamless interconnectivity and cross chain communication provided by the network.ICX still currently retains a position in the top ten highest 24 hour volumes of most South Korean exchanges.ICON (ICX) is up 50.12% over the past month.The recent meeting of the Korean Open Blockchain Industrial Association is encouraging news for the global blockchain community.

562,CryptoSlate,China’s Mother of All Chains (MOAC) Seeks to Compete With Ethereum,Jonathan Kim,1525065780.0,"Can China’s Mother of All Chains (MOAC) outperform the world’s second largest cryptocurrency?As one of the first cryptocurrencies to launch, Ethereum has since revolutionized the blockchain industry through its introduction of dApps and smart contracts – which have been used to launch countless ICOs worldwide.But recently, Ethereum has dealt with issues in efficiency and scaling, constantly maintaining a transaction-congested network that is growing slower with increased usage.A team of developers from China is attempting to solve these issues through MOAC, a blockchain network that utilizes cross-chain transactions and “MicroChains” to increase speed and efficiency.The Mother of All Chains improves on Ethereum’s decentralized network by adding additional layers (MicroChains) to the blockchain for distinct transaction types based on required computation power.In an interview with Forbes, MOAC Chief Business Development Officer Ryan Wang stated:“In a blockchain system like Ethereum, there’s no difference between a balance transfer transaction and a smart contract transaction… All the transactions are handled at the global level, thus greatly limiting the TPS and the system-level performance.”By distinguishing the MicroChains within the MOAC network by transaction type – balance transfer and smart contract transactions – the total network is able to operate more efficiently. Each MicroChain is individually configured for a transaction type on a separate consensus module.According to the MOAC whitepaper,“MOAC is to design a scalable and resilient Blockchain that supports transactions, data access, control flow in a layered structure. It creates the framework to allow users to execute Smart Contract in an efficient way. It also provides the architecture to spawn sub blockchains using underlying infrastructure quickly and easily.”Introducing Smart Contract as MicroChain (SAAM)To make this unique network accessible, MOAC has developed the Smart Contract as MicroChain (SAAM) ecosystem to help developers build and configure dApps to meet their specific needs. Wang states:“SAAM produces a dApp friendly ecosystem that allows developers to create the blockchain that best fits their use case. This creates a healthier ecosystem and increases TPS and system performance as more miners join.”How MOAC uses Cross-chain to integrate a divided blockchainWith greater efficiency comes the issue of inter-MicroChain communication. Cross-chains provide the ability to make transactions across blockchains – connecting the communities behind once distinct networks.The MOAC network is now liveIn June 2017, MOAC raised nearly $7 million through its ICO and has since garnered immense support via Chinese social media communities like WeChat and QQ.Although MOAC is currently listed as an ERC20 token, like EOS and TRON, it will soon utilize its own native blockchain and token. According to the MOAC Business Whitepaper:“Purchaser will receive certificate token over Ethereum network “MOAC_ETH” for the funds contributed. Purchaser will be able to claim MOAC in MoacChain once it is up running at the ratio 1:1.”For more information about MOAC, including price, founders and social media links, please see our MOAC coin profile.Posted In: China, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
563,CryptoSlate,"April Was All Systems OmiseGo, Up 52% Over Past Month",Jonnie Emsley,1525052220.0,"OmiseGo’s impressive recovery has once again proven its worthiness amongst the coveted top 20 coins by market cap.A few glancing blows of controversy have not been enough to derail the coin’s recent performance, with a series of exchange listings and partnerships seeing it erupt to a two-month high.OmiseGo is up 11% over the past week.What is OmiseGo?The prodigious child of established payments provider Omise, OmiseGo’s public PoS blockchain is yet another humanitarian attempt to “bank the unbanked” — disrupting traditional payment networks that have held monopolies for decades  — the likes of SWIFT, CHIPS or FedWire.OmiseGo is a public Ethereum-based financial technology for use in mainstream digital wallets.This mission is by no means unique, yet OmiseGo’s angle is radical. Where the bulk of cryptocurrencies attempt to replace fiat entirely, OMG is the eternal peacemaker — a one-stop-shop for payment and exchange for currencies of all description (fiat included).Put simply, OmiseGo is an Ethereum-based bridge to connect payment processors, financial institutions and gateway providers. Complete with a decentralized exchange, eWallet SDK, and smart contract platform, the Bangkok-based project sees itself as an all-encompassing payment solution — offering peer-to-peer transaction for payments, payrolls, cross-border remittances and more.Tackling what it calls a “messy web of indirect ownership and delayed settlement”, the OmiseGo team enjoys heavy affiliation with Ethereum, toting advisory (and revelry) from the revered Vitalik Buterin:Right now my favorite token model is OMG-style staking tokens.

Shinhan has tapped into OmiseGo’s generous portfolio of payment solutions — despite Shinhan’s earlier interest in a Ripple pilot program. OMG’s CEO and Founder Jun Hasegawa wrote:The agreement confirms mutual interest, and closer collaboration between the parties to further advance ShinhanCard’s digital offerings across its portfolio of payment services and mobile application in today’s growing mobile payments market.Just days after, OmiseGo welcomed the prolific stablecoin MakerDAO as a trading pair on its decentralized exchange.Related Story: MakerDAO Launches New Dai Stablecoin on the Ethereum BlockchainWith the mutual goal of financial decentralization, OmiseGo and MakerDAO’s move is compelling — providing OmiseGo a stable asset needed to build its emerging empire, while providing Maker an additional currency as collateral — a fundamental requirement of how DAI achieves stability.Next on the list of appointments was APEC — Hasegawa enlightening APEC Business Advisory Council members on the benefits of its blockchain-based payment solutions.

As April draws to a close, one might wonder how May could possibly upstage this list of decisively progressive milestones. Filled with a number of significant developments, one would assume OMG’s acceleration has been organic — carried by a sound momentum towards its vision of a disruptive payment nexus.Having caught the eye of the most influential allies it may need to achieve this bold vision — financial giants, NGOs and prominent cryptocurrencies, the OmiseGo team won’t be losing a wink of sleep over CoinDesk’s misfire.For more information on OmiseGo, including price, market cap, volume and technical information, see our OmiseGo coin profile.Posted In: Thailand, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
564,CryptoSlate,EOS Up 79% In Past Week In Lead Up to Mainnet Launch,Sam Town,1524989160.0,"The upcoming EOS mainnet launch is currently one of the most anticipated events on the blockchain calendar. The lead up to the launch, which will occur on the 2nd of June, has seen the value of EOS skyrocket, climbing over 72% in the last seven days. With a market cap of over $17 billion and a token value at an all-time high of $21, EOS has captured the position as the 5th most valuable crypto — but is the explosive growth of the token justified?Alongside the mainnet launch, EOS has recently announced a number of initiatives that have pushed the token into the upper echelons of coin rankings, such as a new VC partnership and a hackathon intended to drive dApp developers toward the platform.EOS 7-day performanceCan EOS Deliver?The EOS project has captured a significant amount of attention for the features it promises. EOS is designed to deliver the ideal environment for dApp development and deployment, offering extremely high transaction throughput paired with no transaction fees whatsoever.Related Story: EOS Gains Speed Up Despite Sluggish Market In Advance of Mainnet LaunchWhile it’s true that EOS does present technical stack that can theoretically keep up with the intense transaction demands presented by millions of distributed app users via a Delegated Proof of Stake consensus method, some market observers are not convinced by what is perceived to be a massive overvaluation of the EOS token.Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has recently suggested that the entire spectrum of “alt” cryptocurrencies is massively overvalued, emphasizing his perspective that the blockchain ecosystem is currently oversaturated with speculation. Cryptocurrency analyst Joseph Young has also highlighted the runaway valuation of EOS, comparing the blockchain startup to SpaceX:https://twitter.com/iamjosephyoung/status/990674209507393536If EOS is able to deliver on the anticipated “millions” of transactions per second it offers and foster the development of an active, productive third-party developer community, then it’s possible that the token will retain a strong value. The current value of EOS, however, is arguably attributable to pre-mainnet launch hype and the influence of a highly effectively executed marketing campaign.Is EOS Too Centralized?The EOS project may provide a solution to the scalability issues that currently hinder widespread dApp deployment and usage, but at what cost? The technical architecture of EOS relies on 121 community elected nodes, 21 of which fulfill the function of mining blocks.Don Larimer is the founder of EOS.Some community members have likened this structure to a trusted third party, which from one perspective is at odds with the original decentralized vision expressed within Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper.EOS proponents, however, argue that as EOS “supernodes” are voted in by the community the EOS architecture is highly resistant to corruption, and thus is in line with the purpose of decentralized ledger tech.The EOS governance model also allows for protocol-level changes to be implemented without the need for forking, allowing token holders to participate in the evolution of the network itself.Bitcoin hash rate distribution from blockchain.info — arguably highly centralizedDan Larimer, the CTO of EOS, holds the perspective that decentralization is not a black and white matter. According to Larimer when it comes to decentralization, numbers are not everything — distribution matters. In a 2015 exposition on the practical implications of decentralization, Larimer highlights the utility of Delegated Proof of Stake networks such EOS:“With delegated proof of stake the network can remain secure even if the currency was evenly distributed among 1 million users … Only delegated proof of stake has the power to leverage the stake of millions of individual users to secure the network”Posted In: EOS, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
565,CryptoSlate,Ethereum-based ERC20 Exchange Airswap Totals $1 Million During Its First Day of Operations,Shiraz Jagati,1524906300.0,"Market debuts are always ridden with an element of uncertainty and doubt but Ethereum-based cryptocurrency exchange, Airswap, managed to rope in more than $1 million in transactions on its very first day of operations.While Airswap may be a new player within the burgeoning crypto market, the team that backs the company is replete with experienced members of the digital-currency domain. The New-York venture is headed by Michael Oved, a former trader at high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial Inc.Airswap is a protocol for P2P trading of Ethereum tokens. AirSwap was designed from the ground up to provide privacy, security, and choice on a global, peer-to-peer trading network with no intermediaries and no trading fees.Similarly, Airswap also has onboard people like Joe Lubin who is one of the co-founders of the Ethereum Blockchain as well as Michael Novogratz, the present CEO of crypto-banking service, Galaxy Digital.The Airswap DifferenceWith so many crypto trading platforms available for use in the market today, the question naturally arises “what makes Airswap different from its contemporaries?”In its core essence, Airswap serves as a digital market forum where buyers and sellers cannot identify one another for reasons related to individual privacy and anonymity. Users have to find each another by posting ads on bulletin boards where they have to mention what exactly it is that they would like to sell. Through the use of smart contracts, trades are executed with a high degree of security and decentralization.Talking about the core benefits of Airswap, Richard Johnson from Greenwich Associates had the following words of praise:“What’s novel about Airswap is that there’s no New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq type entity in the middle, setting rules. That’s cool, we haven’t seen that before.”Similarly, Michael Oved also expounded on AirSwap’s unique hands-on approach model:“Airswap does not manage or ever touch user funds. It works simply as a software platform for discovery of peers with whom users can swap tokens on a peer-to-peer basis through ethereum smart contracts. There is no central exchange hub or clearinghouse. The transactions are negotiated peer-to-peer, and then the swap is executed and cleared on the ethereum blockchain.”Using its unique functional setup, the online exchange is able to bypass many of the regulatory rules that have been imposed by certain countries on their investor base. Oved said that with Airswap it is impossible for governments to trace the activities of particular individuals who may be operating from different parts of the world.Foreseeable threats for AirswapAs decentralized online exchanges continue to become more popular by the day, incidents related to hacking and cyber attacks are becoming more prevalent than ever before.Related Story: MyEtherWallet Compromised as Hackers Make Their Way with over $150K Worth of Digital CurrencyJust a few days back it was reported that popular hosting service, MyEthererWallet, had been compromised by hackers who made off with more than $150k worth of digital currency.Similarly,  EtherDelta also fell victim to a digital hack last December when cybercriminals stole $250,000 by taking over EtherDelta’s DNS server and launching a fake one that looked nearly identical to the original server.Final thoughtsIn an interview with a respected online journal, Michael Oved outlined his vision for Airswap and said that he hopes to attract large institutional traders such as DRW Holdings LLC and DV Chain to his platform in the near future.While work still needs to be done in relation to the existing security infrastructure used by many big name exchanges, Airswap’s release and initial success definitely showcases the demand for such unique products from within the global crypto-community.For more information on Airswap including price, market cap, price charts and social media links, please see our Airswap coin profile.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis, Exchanges, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
566,CryptoSlate,"Stellar Lumens April Update: Adoption and Partnerships, Up 76% Over Past Month",Jonnie Emsley,1524879900.0,"Having rocketed into the top 10 coins late last year with its lightning-fast transactions and charitable proposition, Stellar Lumens seems to be firmly on the path to recovery after a severe correction in Q1 2018.While sitting in a respectable 8th position by market cap, March’s dystopia saw bone-shaking losses for the coin, XLM being one of the greatest victims of the bear market.Cut from its January all-time-high of $0.85 down to $0.17, XLM’s 80% loss could have been a lethal blow to a sub-10 coin.Stellar Lumens is up 17.57% over the past week.Picking itself off the canvas, Stellar “future of banking” Lumens appears to not only be unharmed — but stronger than ever — firing off a powerful combination with a series of adoption-boosting announcements.Lumens $XLM is best performing unicorn crypto asset this week with ~ 70% gain in average market price vs $USD, followed by $IOTA, $OMG, $ADA, $XEM, $ICX & $XMRAll unicorn cryptos are green for the week except $ONT & $BNB slighly red (besides $USDT of course).– @CoinMarketCap pic.twitter.com/LPC0l47m2C— Stellar Lumens (@StellarLumens) April 18, 2018Spurred on by its integration in MobileCoin, Stellar has led the market recovery with a sustained bullish turn — with April 27’s 16% increase enough to seat it as the best performer amongst the top 25.What is Stellar Lumens?First and foremost, Stellar Lumens is a payment platform bent on disrupting cross-border capital flows between financial institutions — offering a cheaper, faster alternative to the decades-old infrastructure of banks.Stellar vs Ripple & Ethereumhttps://t.co/v1obrQ38TD https://t.co/v1obrQ38TD— Stellar Lumens (@StellarLumens) April 15, 2018McCaleb was one of the co-founders of Ripple. He left Ripple in 2014 to focus exclusively on Stellar.Ironically, Stellar’s founder Jed McCaleb had a key hand in creating project’s biggest adversary — having co-founded Ripple in 2012 — going on to fork Stellar from the Ripple protocol in 2014.Where Ripple is developed more fundamentally around a centralized architecture, Stellar opts for a diplomatic hybrid of decentralization and centralization — offering the perks of blockchain to the world’s present-day financial systems.While this ambiguity has landed Stellar a few lashings of criticism, it is advantageous for its developing market-focus;  zeroing in with precision on money remittances and loaning for the unbanked.When it comes to cross-border transfers, Stellar offers banks groundbreaking levels of liquidity and speed  — enabled by simultaneous validation between parties. Instead of acting as a lone cryptocurrency serving the transfer of value, Stellar permits users to transmit fiat across the globe in seconds at negligible cost.MobileCoin IntegrationMobileCoin combines privacy, security, and distributed trust with great user experience.MobileCoin flicked on the afterburners for Stellar after selecting the XLM consensus protocol for their upcoming mobile payments cryptocurrency — its grand vision bound to lend Stellar an inordinate dose of success by proxy.Backed by investment heavyweights such as Binance Labs, MobileCoin breezily raised $30 million for its privacy coin, aiming to be used for payment within the world’s most prolific mobile messaging apps. Despite not utilizing the Stellar network for their ICO, MobileCoin’s sizable project will have profoundly positive implications for XLM.As MobileCoin gains traction,  Stellar will assumingly act as the bridge for converting fiat to and from MobileCoin’s native token.All Systems GoDespite the electric chemistry, Stellar is not bound to monogamy with MobileCoin — a number of suitors have been queuing round the block for a taste of Stellar’s blazing speeds and negligible fees.For example, the Kin Token (KIN) announced it was going to use the Stellar network alongside the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate faster transactions. The Kin development team noted:The addition of Stellar as a second blockchain will allow us to operate the Kin Ecosystem on a faster, more efficient foundation, with low transaction fees — which is necessary for us to achieve the speed and scalability that digital services in the ecosystem will require.Next, there’s AnclaX, who has just proclaimed status as one of Stellar’s ‘anchors’ — allowing Colombian nationals to transfer the Colombian Peso across borders via XLM.AnclaX markets itself as an anchor for Stellar Lumens (XLM) and Columbian Pesos (COP)https://t.co/7iEmostSBkAnclax-issued COP asset is traded on Stellar decentralised exchange. https://t.co/1vsv2Ru3hC— Stellar Lumens (@StellarLumens) April 22, 2018As if Stellar’s schedule was looking empty, the global fintech software provider Novatti Group is looking for a long-term relationship — integrating XLM support for its proprietary payments platform. The Novatti Chief Executive noted:We are focused on leveraging our strong relationship with Stellar to securing additional agreements with its partner network to drive high growth revenue streams in the payments and billing space, driven by growing transactions processing.Final Thoughts on XLM in AprilThrough its mission to move money across borders quickly, Stellar’s evident utility is a fiat-enabler, as opposed to a fiat-destroyer. As Stellar sails in this direction, one might wonder hows its future viability as a blockchain for utility tokens affects its future price and performance. As with most things in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but it will certainly be interesting to see what exciting dApps are built on the Stellar blockchain moving forward.For more information on Stellar including current price, market cap, technical information and social media links, please see our Stellar Lumens coin profile.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
567,CryptoSlate,Cardano (ADA) April Update: Up 53% Over Past Month On New Developments and Exchange Listings,Jonnie Emsley,1524702540.0,"A string of recent developments has seen Cardano (ADA) continue to assert its position as a cardinal cryptocurrency, giving its holders every reason to turn their fling into a long-term relationship.As Bitcoin’s gut-wrenching volatility upsets the hardiest of traders, funds are steadily shifting to the most select altcoins. A ranking in the fiercely cut-throat top 10 is not possible without constant enhancements, announcements, updates, and alterations — all of which the young Cardano project seems to be working tirelessly to deliver.While lacking the industrial hype of a corporate project, the scholarly Cardano has gone from strength to strength since its September 2017 launch. Having has somersaulted its way to rank 7 by market capitalization — ADA’s bountiful $7+ billion market cap sandwiches it firmly between Stellar and Litecoin.What is Cardano?Cardano is a platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion.Carrying on from his work on Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson set out to offer a superior smart contract platform — a blockchain sufficiently equipped to deliver scalability, interoperability, and sustainability: Cardano.Through its unique layered architecture and peer-to-peer academic foundation, Cardano has achieved immense success since its September 2017 launch.The purist might consider Cardano a “whitepaper project” at its finest, deriving value not from its current state, but from its ambitious roadmap and remarkably qualified team — similar to the more established EOS.Despite the project’s infancy, Cardano’s native token has accumulated a formidable momentum — up more than 50% in April — following a stream of crucial exchange listings and technological developments.Exchange listings boost sentimentHuobi issued a healthy dopamine hit to ADA holders on April 16th, announcing the listing of Cardano on their monolithic Beijing-based exchange. As one of the largest Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges, Huobi’s inclusion of Cardano can be considered a seemingly impossible victory for the decidedly western blockchain project.Huobi is a Chinese digital currency trading platform.As one of the toughest nuts to crack, the impenetrable Chinese market has been a tantalizing fantasy to most — with a blockchain industry sealed as tight as the nation’s inscrutable economic policy.In this vein, Cardano may soon enjoy some of the protection offered to the likes of NEO and ONT, not to mention exposure to what is fitted to become the one of the world’s largest blockchain markets.Needless to say, the Huobi listing reinforced ADA’s bullish hike — having erupted alongside BTC’s April 12th outbreak.Cardano is up 43% over the past 30 days.Just as the aftershocks of Huobi’s bombshell began to wear off, traders welcomed twins to the family with Binance’s addition of the ADA/BNB and ADA/USDT pairs. As the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, the Binance announcement was timed perfectly to cement Cardano’s standing as a favorable trading asset.Technical DevelopmentsAs cryptocurrency holders grow wearily resigned to the flaws and limitations of their token, their bitter complaints are lost in the fray of the internet. Cardano is different.When it comes to technological enhancements and amendments, Cardano employs a refreshingly democratic process — amongst an army of militant development teams, who may give the suggestions of their community members as much breathing room as a North Korean electorate.In stark contrast, every holder of ADA may propose an upgrade. Should the proposal be upvoted by the remainder of the community, the development team will see the idea come to fruition.Daedalus is a highly secure wallet for the Ada cryptocurrency.After achieving quorum, March saw the first major technological update since the platform’s September launch, the Daedalus wallet software upgrade.Implementing an asynchronous restoration feature, the upgrade has successfully ironed out the kinks in the blockchain’s default wallet. The team detailed:“Daedalus will detect when the time on a user’s machine is out of sync with the global time and will display an error message asking the user to fix the issue. Before this feature was added when there was a time difference of 20 seconds or more, the Cardano node was unable to connect to the network and validate the blockchain, and Daedalus would be held on the loading screen with the “Connecting to network” message.”For those indifferent to a wallet upgrade, they’ll do well to be unimpressed by the team’s list of recent endeavors. Rolling up their sleeves, the team has given the wallet’s back-end an overhaul, in addition to doing some heavy labor under the hood — working on Linux support, in addition to faster block verification and application.Cardano’s FutureIn the face of ferocious competition, Cardano’s rapid evolution has left the unbeatable for dead. Even the Etherum-faithful can respect Cardano’s hypersonic progress — having raked in a $7 billion market cap in but months — and securing exchange listings sufficient to establish ADA as an integral trading commodity.Where projects achieve outrageous success without substance, Cardano turns heads for its uncanny ability to deliver — egged on by the project’s democratic processes and erudite development team.As the team prepares to raise the curtain on smart contracts with its IELE Virtual Machine, Cardano’s bullish flight is impressive and worth studying closer.For more information on Cardano including price, market cap, technical information, founders and social media links, please see our Cardano coin profile.Posted In: Cardano, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
568,CryptoSlate,EOS Gains Speed Up Despite Sluggish Market In Advance of Mainnet Launch,Sam Town,1524621420.0,"The cryptocurrency market may currently be experiencing a corrective slump but EOS is bucking the trend, continuing to rise against a negative market current. The dApp-focused cryptocurrency currently ranks as the 5th largest token by market cap and is riding a wave of positive investor sentiment driven by the recent launch of EOS Dawn 3.0, a notable venture partnership announcement, and the upcoming launch of the EOS mainnet.EOS has demonstrated a significant surge in value over the last week, catapulting from $8.77 at the beginning of the week to a high of $15.99. After a short correction, EOS has returned to $15, which appears to be a new value paradigm for the token.EOS is trading up 71.25% over the past week.EOS Moves Toward Mainnet LaunchEOS’ impending mainnet launch is a major driver in the token’s recent positive price movement and is scheduled for the 2nd of June. On the 2nd, EOS will migrate from the Ethereum network to its own blockchain over the course of 40 days.EOS.IO is software that introduces a blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications.The transition to the EOS blockchain is set to deliver a wide range of benefits to the token, the most notable of which is transaction speed. Any transaction conducted with ERC20 tokens must be confirmed by the Ethereum network, which currently supports roughly 15 transactions per second.When EOS moves to its own blockchain, however, the EOS development team claims that it will offer dramatically faster transaction speeds.As outlined in a recent EOS Medium post, worst case predictions of transaction speed place EOS at 1,000 TPS with average and best case scenarios delivering speeds of between 3,000 and 6,000 transactions per second, which would make EOS one of the fastest blockchains by transaction speed.Theoretical calculations predict transactions speed of millions of TPS, which would hypothetically place EOS above Visa and Mastercard in terms of transaction throughput.Highly popular exchange Binance has recently announced their support of EOS’ mainnet launch in a recent blog post:“Binance would like to confirm that we will support the EOS MainNet Token Swap. We will handle all technical requirements involved for all users holding EOS.”The EOS mainnet launch will also make available a range of features not currently implemented on the ERC20 version of the token. The launch will enable dApp development and integration, a fact that has been highlighted by the recent EOS Hackathon.EOS has recently invited developers to introduce themselves and their project in order to share in a chance to win a travel stipend of $2,000 USD to the upcoming Hong Kong hackathon. At the event, EOS intends to connect hackers, developers, marketers, businesses and other blockchain entities in order to foster development and growth within the EOS dApp ecosystem.Sign up now for our first Global #EOSHackathon event, in Hong Kong!

Some applicants are groups of EOS enthusiasts that are locally assembled, such as EOS Canada or EOS Rio, while others are significant industry players such as AntPool and Bitfinex.The supernode positions on offer will perform a critical function in the EOS delegated proof of stake consensus mechanism. Supernodes are to be elected by EOS community members and will be tasked with accruing, processing, and mining transactions. Supernodes are also responsible for ensuring that blocks formed through this process are rebroadcast to the minor nodes present within the network.The EOS framework only makes room for 21 supernodes, so competition for the positions is intense.As such, organizations seeking to take a role as an EOS supernode have made significant promises toward the development of the ecosystem.AntPool, BitMain’s mining arm, has recently promised 2,000 servers toward the maintenance of the EOS network, while venture capital firm OK Blockchain Capital has submitted a proposal as part of its application that includes an investment fund of over $100 million toward the development of EOS-based projects and dApps.Bitfinex has also made a number of promises in order to promote their candidacy, promising “around-the-clock, military-grade security,” in a recent blog post:“Our underlying goal is to grow the open-source nature of the decentralized digital asset space, achieved through intensive community development, research and collaboration. Our vision as a block producer is that of a collaborative incubator, combining the potential of EOSIO with our experience to take research, development and adoption to another level.”VC Partnership Establishes EOS Global Joint VentureEOS CEO Brendan BlumerThe upcoming launch of the EOS mainnet is not the only news that has contributed positive token price movement over the last month. At the beginning of April, EOS announced a new partnership between blockchain and VC veterans Winnie Liu and Michael Cao and Block.one — the developers behind the EOS software — that will result in the creation of EOS global, a $200 million joint venture fund.The newly-formed joint venture is intended to make strategic investments in Asia-focused projects that use the EOS ecosystem. Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer has stated that the new investment fund will assist EOS in expanding their global presence:“Block.one is delighted to welcome investment from Michael and Winnie’s fund that will leverage EOSIO to catalyze the transformation of the digital assets space in Asia. EOS VC is expanding its global reach through divers partners poised to offer EOSIO projects unprecedented international access.”The capital injection is one of several recent large-scale VC investments into the EOS project, which include partnerships with Finlab AG, Galaxy Digital, and Tomorrow Blockchain Opportunities. The total amount of VC captured by the EOS VC program now totals in excess of $600 million, which has given the development team a boost in their roadmap progress and provided investors with a significant amount of confidence in the project.How Will the EOS 1.0 Launch Impact Token Values?The upcoming EOS mainnet launch is likely to have a positive impact on token values. Historically, the launch of unique blockchain mainnets has been accompanied by a significant price increase as the market observes the fruition of a lengthy development process.As EOS is primarily driven by dApps, however, it may take some time for the market at large to respond to the mainnet launch of the token. A token that is experiencing a run-up toward mainnet launch is TRON, which has also made significant gains over the last month.Posted In: EOS, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
569,CryptoSlate,Exploring the Top 5 Technological Advantages of IOTA Over Blockchain,Shiraz Jagati,1524657180.0,"With “blockchain technology” grabbing most of the headlines when it comes to crypto-innovation, IOTA is offering users with an all-new digital framework that promises to introduce a similar level of innovation but within a much larger, industrial scale.IOTA’s key market driver is its native technological offering called Tangle, which unlike a blockchain, maps transactions onto an entire network as opposed to a single data-chain.This helps diversify the implementation capabilities as well as the scope of application for IOTA, especially for customers looking to incorporate a decentralized ledger technology within an industrial setup.What are the core advantages of IOTA over Blockchain?1.Transaction RatesOne of the biggest issues with the blockchain, as originally developed for Bitcoin, is its slow transaction times.As things currently stand, transfer rates for the blockchain currently lay in the low double-digit range, which to be honest, are quite low for many modern applications.IOTA employs a system wherein the transaction rates increase dramatically as more customers begin to use its native platform. Not only that, through the use of an innovative consensus protocol, IOTA is able to provide its customers with shorter confirmation times.2. Micro-PaymentsWhen using regular blockchain based payment portals, the transaction fees are usually set by the sender/initiator of the transaction. As a result of this, it becomes increasingly unfeasible to process smaller payments amounts.One of the biggest advantages of IOTA is its ability to facilitate small payments with the incurrence of little to no transaction fees.3. ScalabilityFrom a purely technical standpoint, we find that IOTA uses a processing module that becomes faster as its number of subscribers and transactions increase.It is also worth mentioning that when using IOTA, the time between placing a transaction and its validation starts to become zero as soon as a certain data-size is achieved.4. Future ReadyRelated Story: IOTA’s Impending Trinity Desktop Wallet Launch Catalyzes Price RecoveryOne of the central issues for customers using the blockchain is that the technology is expensive in terms of its computational requirements and security assurance.For example, to implement Bitcoin mining processes, more and more computing power is needed as time goes on.However, IOTA reduces such heavy cost requirements by eliminating key areas of the conventional mining process.5. SafetyWhen using the Blockchain, its owner, in theory, has the power to manipulate the system with new data, thereby modifying it for their personal gains. As a result of this, there exists a tangible dilemma for organizations looking to integrate the blockchain with externally auditable applications wherein the immutability of data needs to be maintained at all times.What makes IOTA so appealing for industrial use cases?Related Story: IOTA Demonstrates Real-World Use Case With Smart Vehicle Charging StationsIn addition to the aforementioned advantages, IOTAs use can also go beyond its deployment as a simple payment protocol.For example, large business operations can choose to adopt IOTAs Tangle technology to support their IoT use cases.Similarly, through the use of Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM), IOTA is able to streamline encrypted data transfers while maintaining a high level of integrity, data protection, and data access management.Looking Ahead…Related Story: Introduction to IOTA – The Internet of ThingsWith the crypto revolution now in full swing, more and more users are looking for real-world technological options that can make alt-asset driven micropayments a reality.IOTA not only provides a platform that has the potential to facilitate digital payments for everyday transactions and trade but also delivers a technology which makes IoT communication a reality.Posted In: IOTA, Altcoins, Analysis, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
570,CryptoSlate,"TRON Promises $1.7 Million Airdrop, Pushes Toward Mainnet Launch and Opens Taiwan Office",Sam Town,1524549600.0,"Love it or hate it, TRON is one of the fastest moving projects in the cryptocurrency market lately. The controversial project has captured significant gains over the last week, rising from just over $0.04 to $0.072 due to the launch of the TRON testnet combined with an impending 30 Million TRX airdrop worth $1.7 million, capturing the attention of the crypto community.The last month has proven to be a critical period for the entertainment-focused blockchain platform. Alongside the highly-anticipated airdrop, a high frequency of GitHub commits, the announcement of new Taiwan-based office, and a new $100,000 initiative intended to expand the TRON ecosystem have all contributed to a shifting community perspective of the divisive project.TRON Announces $1.7M Airdrop To Ethereum CommunityIn a Medium post published on the 21st of April, the TRON team announced that 30 million TRX would be distributed via an airdrop to the Ethereum community as a “show of gratitude” for their support during the developmental phase of the project:“TRON will airdrop 30M TRX to the Ethereum community as a show of our gratitude towards Ethereum for their support during TRON’s ERC20 phase, in addition to preparing for the Super Representative Elections after mainnet launch. TRON will airdrop 30M TRX (equivalent to approximately $1.7 million) to active user with a balance of over 1 ETH after January 1, 2018.”According to the announcement, each account credited during the airdrop will receive between 10 and 100 TRX, with amounts selected randomly. The TRON team state that Ethereum played a “vital role” during the development of the TRON project, and want to provide TRX to the Ethereum community in order to allow users to experience their “high TPS development platform” as well as participate in TRON’s decentralized governance model.Any wallet on the Ethereum blockchain that holds a balance of over 1 ETH and either transfer or receives ETH from block 4832686 to block 5471198 will be eligible for the airdrop. The move is clearly intended to attract the Ethereum community to the TRON project, with TRON founder Justin Sun emphasizing the fact that TRON is now moving into direct competition with Ethereum at the recent TRON testnet launch:“From today to the last day, we are no longer the ERC20 token and in the future we will compete with Ethereum as a DApp platform. We will compete face to face with Ethereum, and we have confidence we will build a large ecosystem; a much large ecosystem than the Ethereum … we can surpass Ethereum in the future.”TRON Boasts Second Most Active GitHub, Opens Taiwan OfficeRelated Story: Justin Sun Announces Launch of the TRON TestnetThe TRON project has frequently been criticised by skeptical market observers regarding its slow pace of development and lack of a minimum viable product. Development appears to have increased speed recently, with the TRON GitHub demonstrating over 1440 commits from 41 different contributors, making it the second most active altcoin in the cryptocurrency development landscape, ranking slightly behind EOS.In addition to picking up the pace of development, TRON has recently announced the opening of new offices in crypto-friendly island nation Taiwan. Justin Sun announced the opening of the office in a Tweet on the 22nd of April, stating that TRON would be participating in the Taiwan Blockchain Self-Regulatory Organization.Justin: #TRON will open an office in Taiwan soon, and participate in the Taiwan Blockchain Self-Regulatory Organization.— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) April 23, 2018In a subsequent Tweet, Sun highlighted the fact that TRON will be offering job opportunities for specialists from a variety of sectors:“Right now there is a great opportunity for Taiwan engineers, marketers, PR, and others. You can join our TRON lab in TW, and participate in our community. Taiwan will be an important blockchain community!”TRON’s move to Taiwan is a strategic one — the nation has recently adopted a strong pro-crypto stance in order to foster the growth of blockchain technology and DLT-based industries within the country. Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission chairman Wellington Koo stated last year that the crypto industry will be treated in a manner that allows for the establishment of a  “fintech sandbox” for cryptocurrency and blockchain startups:“Just because China and South Korea are banning, doesn’t mean that Taiwan should follow suit – there is a huge opportunity for growth in the future. We should emulate Japan, where they treat cryptocurrency as a highly regulated, highly monitored industry like securities.”Moving into an environment that promotes the development of blockchain projects in a proactive manner that allows blockchain organizations to govern themselves in a self-regulating crypto regulatory body is a positive move any platform, including TRON.Justin Sun Announces $100,000 TRON LoanOne of the more interesting announcements from TRON over the last week is the unexpected launch of a new initiative in which the TRON will incentivize developers to contribute to the project.In order to “expand TRON’s ecosystem,”, developers will be provided with loans of up to $100,000 USD in order to help solve budget shortage issues and assist with research and development operations.#TRX #TRON loan, $100000 to discovery of your brilliance @Tronfoundation https://t.co/MAuGNE4tCZ pic.twitter.com/ejSUUxYZAv— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) April 20, 2018Loans will be provided to developers that are able to contribute dApps and high-quality utility applications for the TRON network, and offers organizations or individuals that seek to contribute a choice between two financing options — developers can choose to either provide TRON with equity in recompense should the organization complete a new round of financing, or simply repay the loan interest-free in USD or “mainstream digital assets” within 18 months of financing.Community reception to the loan offer has yielded a significant amount of heated discourse — while some proponents of the project argue that the loan initiative can be considered an investment strategy that yields tangible returns in the form of equity in valuable TRON-focused projects, others contest the viability of offering such large financial assistance to external projects while TRON is struggling with self-admitted budget shortage  issues.TRON Community Anticipates Mainnet Launch, Price StabilizesWith the launch of the TRON mainnet set for May 31st, the TRON development team appears to be pushing heavily toward development in order to meet their roadmap goals. The spate of announcements released over the last week has boosted flagging investor confidence in the project, which has resulted in overall gains of 10%.While TRON may be a controversial project among some, it’s clear that the team behind it is heavily invested in the success of the platform.Posted In: Tron, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
571,CryptoSlate,Einsteinium: The Road to Recovery,Bill DeLisle,1524455160.0,"Einsteinium has always been a little bit different than everyone else. Their currency is older than many others – its origins go all the way back to 2014 –  and it remained primarily dormant until 2017 when a new group of developers took over the unique project.Einsteinium is a proof of work currency with a philanthropic side goal of funding scientific research and cutting-edge IT and crypto projects.Einsteinium aims to create a fundraising platform that could support academic and philanthropic projects, which is distinct among the crypto space dominated by a p2p ethos and enterprise initiatives.Of course, that doesn’t mean that Einsteinium is entirely distinct from the rest of the crypto-scene.New developments have resulted in meaningful price increases from less than $0.01 to around $0.50 by the end of November 2017. That’s when things started to get really crazy.By the beginning of December, Einsteinium’s digital token – cleverly named EMC2 – soared to over $2. The reasons for this price spike, like so many others, were not wholly organic. December didn’t trigger the charitable instincts of the investment community to send EMC2 through the roof.The Hype Stage2017 created a crypto craze that left enthusiastic investors looking for the next big thing, and many cryptocurrency startups were all too happy to promote their initiatives as such.Related Story: Einsteinium – What Is It and Where Is It GoingAs a result, several unscrupulous practices became normative. Airdrops, hard forks, pump, and dumps, became coded language for investors looking to make a significant and immediate profit.Einsteinium isn’t totally innocent in this regard.Their team announced a December hard fork that would reduce the supply of EMC2 tokens by nearly 20% from 300 million to 245 million.With less supply, many investors rightfully reasoned that the value of the remaining tokens would soar.While the intent was more nuanced and included the elimination of a wormhole, it was most noted for its impact on the coin price.On December 10th, EMC2 announced that the hard-fork was successful, and the price began rising even before its completion. Within a week, it hit an all-time-high, before plunging nearly 50% in less than five days. The price never recovered.Instead, it continued a downward trend to $0.30, which is a significant jump from its earliest price, but it’s a far fall from the height of the hard-fork.Accusations AboundThe trouble began before the hard fork even executed. It started on Twitter, as so many controversies do, with a November 30th tweet promoting a “Mind Blowing Announcement.”EMC2 mind-blowing announcement to be made on December 19th @einsteiniumcoin pic.twitter.com/RDGegNk9zH— Einsteinium (@einsteiniumcoin) November 30, 2017The message included a picture of a MacBook and a loose machination of the Apple color scheme. Many speculated that Einsteinium would announce a strategic partnership with Apple, so news that the announcement was actually a network upgrade both underwhelmed investors and infuriated followers.Despite contradicting this rumor in a subsequent Tweet, the foundation was accused of misleading investors and inappropriately hyping their currency. When coupled with the hard fork price rise and fall, it was a bad look for Einsteinium.Members of their Reddit community accused Einsteinium of being a scam, and animosity grew as the coin’s value failed to recover.The value of the EMC2 coin rose and fell during the series of announcements and disappointments.Learning from Mistakes. Looking to the Future.To be sure, the scam chatter has quieted, and there is evidence that the development team doesn’t have malicious intentions. For example, most of Einsteinium’s currency is held in the custodial wallet, not by its owners and developers.In the past year, Einsteinium has learned the hard way that generating hype isn’t the most advantageous way forward. Therefore, they are focused on functionality and new products.Einsteinium is now finalizing their crowdfunding platform, which is intended to operate like Kickstarter for academic or philanthropic causes. They’ve released an Android Beta version of their social wallet that bears some semblance to Venmo. This app could make it easier for causes to integrate the Einsteinium giving model directly into their platforms.The Einsteinium team are also focused on making it easier to attain Einsteinium. On April 12th, Einsteinium completed its application for inclusion on Binance, one of the most prominent digital currency exchanges available.pic.twitter.com/DvSFEnne0Y— Einsteinium (@einsteiniumcoin) April 13, 2018The team knows that they are not competing with crypto juggernauts like Bitcoin and Litecoin and is focused on working on what they do best. As they recently told CryptoSlate:“Einsteinium is positioning itself to be used for fundraising throughout the world.”The Einsteinium team has plans in the works for testing their platform with charitable causes and political organizations. In doing so, they hope to demonstrate their platform’s tangible viability.Einsteinium intends to learn from its mistakes. A more measured social media campaign and a cognizant move away from the hype and toward usability are driving their decisions.Einsteinium chief strategist, Ben Kurland, explained that:“[Cryptocurrencies] inspire the imagination with their volatility and the price movements. But it is really a distraction from what’s going on, which is an incredible revolutionary technology that has the potential to change the world for the better in so many ways.”Their future seems focused on this ambition — changing the world by supporting projects that matter the most.Posted In: Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
572,CryptoSlate,Altcoins Igniting But Ethereum Founder Isn’t Ready for Liftoff,Sam Town,1524282240.0,"Investors and traders may be celebrating the apparent return of “alt season” as crypto values across the board exhibit positive movement, but Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin isn’t convinced.Related Story: Crypto Price Watch: Price Surges for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, LitecoinThe cryptocurrency market is currently exhibiting strong bullish signals, with a cumulative market cap of over $388 billion. While a large portion of this growth is attributed to high market cap cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, the top 50 altcoins are almost all experiencing 7-day average positive movement of 5%.Cryptocurrency traders may be enthused by the shift in market sentiment, but Vitalik Buterin has decried the recent surge in interest, stating that most altcoin valuations are “far ahead of accomplishments.”Buterin is Sick of Altcoin SpeculationIn a lengthy interview with the Financial Times published earlier this week, the Ethereum creator struck out against a number of blockchain projects including Tron, which Buterin cited as an example of “projects that never had a soul.”“There’s projects that never had a soul, that are just like, ra-ra, price go up, Lambo, vrromm, buybuybuy now!”Buterin proceeded to critique the Tron project which, in January, boasted an astronomical market cap of $17 billion USD with no demonstrable product. While Buterin has remained staunchly opposed to cryptocurrency speculators that maintain a position in the market solely with the intent to capitalize on the new asset class, the Ethereum founders’ qualms regarding the Tron project are valid.Promoted as a blockchain-based protocol designed specifically for the entertainment industry, Tron captured a significant amount of investor capital with no MVP.Justin Sun, Tron’s founder, gained infamy within the cryptocurrency community for posting a continuous series of “announcements of announcements,” goading investors with promises of partnerships that took an inordinate amount of time to actualize.We will announce our partnership with a very prestigious public listed company next week. Looking forward to it!— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) January 4, 2018Tron’s current performance is far more in line with the real value of the platform — only having recently announced testnet implementation, Tron now possesses a far smaller market cap of $3.3 billion.Related Story: Justin Sun Announces Launch of the TRON TestnetThe criticism that Buterin levels at Tron can be applied to many high market cap projects present within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Outside of high-profile blockchain projects, the level of speculation and manipulation that occurs within the cryptocurrency market is highly evident.Viewing the weekly and even daily chart patterns of low market cap cryptocurrencies reveals concerning levels of manipulation, with evidence of “pump and dump” groups rife.Buterin Roasts HODLersButerin, who recently captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community for publicly denouncing Bitcoin Cash proponent Craig Wright at the recent Deconomy conference, is widely known to hold enmity toward the Tron project.Buterin challenging Wright at Deconomy 2018The ongoing wrath of Vitalik Buterin, however, is not limited to blockchain developers and project founders. In his conversation with the Financial Times, Buterin ridiculed cryptocurrency millionaires that have profited by HODLing their investment through the wild vicissitudes of the crypto market:“It’s the luck of the draw, where everyone who won the draw seems to feel like they deserved it for being smarter. I was loyal and I was virtuous and I held through and therefore I deserve to have my five mansions and 23 lambos!”Related Story: The Wrath of Vitalik: Crypto Savant Hulks Out, Rampages on TwitterButerin’s evident hostility toward cryptocurrency speculators and his perceived overvaluation of the altcoin market appears to step from a frustration with the lack of focus on the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies in favor of short-term profits.Speaking with Israeli financial newspaper, TheMarker, last year, Buterin outlined his perspective on innovation versus capitalization:“I think that one of the reasons for this is that it is a social revolution wrapped in something speculative, that can make people rich. Sometimes a conflict is created between people that want to change the world and people that see this technology as an investment instrument.”Buterin may hold a valid perspective, but it’s arguable that the extremely lucrative altcoin market is a key driver in attracting institutional investors to the blockchain sector which, in turn, drives further innovation.Ultimately, Buterin makes a strong argument for blockchain technology as a disruptor of monolithic financial and societal structures, emphasizing his vision of the true impact of the blockchain revolution:“Scrappy grocery stores, with five-year-old kids helping mommy and daddy rearrange the water bottles. These are the people you’re actually serving”Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
573,CryptoSlate,IOTA Demonstrates Real-World Use Case With Smart Vehicle Charging Stations,Peter Ivancic,1524222600.0,"IOTA integration into vehicle charging stations demonstrates the potential of seamless Machine-to-Machine transactions.Netherlands-based ElaadNL has officially unveiled the world first Internet of Things capable charging station by harnessing the IOTA tangle to facilitate direct transactions between vehicle and charger. This application of the protocol represents a milestone, providing a tangible demonstration of the possibilities of feeless M2M transactions.The ElaadNL test lab charging site, located in Arnhems Buiten business park, demonstrated its first completely autonomous transaction on April 13th with Harm van den Brink charging a toy mini Tesla that had been specifically outfitted with the prerequisite hardware.A charging station powering a mini Tesla. Image (Source: Elaad.nl)A User-First Open StandardTo facilitate this transaction, the IOTA charging station is outfitted with an e-Mobility ISO 15118 charging port.Related Story: IOTA’s Impending Trinity Desktop Wallet Launch Catalyzes Price RecoveryThis charging standard has been developed the International Organization for Standardization, a worldwide federation of national standards bodies, to establish universal compatibility for the vehicle to grid communications infrastructure. This allows for secure, tamper-free charging and billing of electric vehicles across the world.The standard allows compatible vehicles to simply plug and charge with no need for RFID, Bluetooth or any other transmission protocols. Communications between the vehicle and charging bay transact directly through the plug, establishing TCP/IP communications via the charging station to exchange data with the vehicle.After connecting, the bay facilitates the exchange of digital signatures and certificates that act as public keys — like those commonly used in blockchain wallets — allowing it to build a trust relationship between the communicating parties and authenticating the transaction based on the agreed digital contract.IOTA is focused on being useful for the emerging machine-to-machine (m2m) economy of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), data integrity, micro-/nano- payments, and other applications where a scalable decentralized system is warranted.The digital contract used in the transaction is outlined by the vehicle, meaning the open standard allows customers choose their vehicle’s energy provider.This contractual handshake allows the consumer to link their transaction to a legal binding contract supplied by their vehicle manufacturer, mobility operator — or in the case of IOTA — a compatible blockchain smart contract.Contracts such as these require no intermediary body, IOTA integration allows for a direct transaction between parties, deducting the cost from the user wallet via secure, real time micro-payments that backup to the tangle every 15 minutes.For those with incompatible vehicles, the system also allows for direct transactions to the charging station, users simply direct a transaction to a charging stations address, and leftover tokens will be returned to the wallet.The car-charging smartphone app interface.Tangible Results for Fee Free Instantaneous Trust NetworksProviding a secure automated transaction layer is the cornerstone of the IOTA platform — the ability to provide a verifiable permissionless trust economy will revolutionize the way we interact with our devices.The IOTA foundation is excited to present the possibilities of their platform in such a real and tangible way, as Alisa Maas, the Foundation’s Head of mobility states:“This solution demystifies IOTA’s potential to become the backbone for the Machine Economy. Thanks to ElaadNL’s cutting edge innovation, seamless e-mobility is taking one big leap forward and we look forward to sharing this achievement with the rest of our growing ecosystem, at the crossroads of mobility, energy and smart cities sectors.”The tangle’s scope spreads far beyond the automotive industry.Related Story: Introduction to IOTA – The Economy of ThingsAs a partner of the Trusted IoT Alliance, the IOTA foundation has seen investments from large multinationals such as Bosch, Volkswagen, Canonical and Microsoft Azure. Many of these companies look to IOTA to provide a secure, traceable means of data management between their sensors to allow for real-time, scalable solutions for the upcoming Internet of Things evolution.ElaadNL’s implementation of the IOTA tangle demonstrates one of the core use cases for the IoT focused technology, creating a fee-free, seamless transaction settlement layer allowing both humans and machines to participate in the flourishing digital economy without the interference of third-party establishments.Posted In: IOTA, Adoption, Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
574,CryptoSlate,Waltonchain Subsidiary Partners with Alibaba’s IoT Connectivity Alliance,Peter Ivancic,1524133620.0,"Alibaba Group, the conglomerate responsible for China’s largest e-commerce platform, has seen rapid expansion into neighboring markets growing at an incredible rate. As part of a recent forward-leaning development strategy, Alibaba has formed The IoT Connectivity Alliance, which now includes logistics-based blockchain project Waltonchain.Since the release of its first online marketplace in 1999, Alibaba has expanded into Digital Payments, Financing, Health Services, Entertainment and now, onto the Blockchain.Alibaba s a Chinese multinational e-commerce, retail, Internet, AI, and technology conglomerate founded in 1999.In addition to operating one of the largest e-commerce platforms globally, Alibaba also operates AliCloud, the companies cloud computing arm. AliCloud is China’s largest high-end cloud computing provider and according to a 2018 study conducted by Synergy Research Group, recently entered the top 5 cloud service companies in the world.In order to maintain its momentum, AliCloud continues to diversify its business model. Following recent industry trends, the company has branched out into the emerging IoT marketplace signing strategic partnerships with Bosch and providing the support network for Phillips’ smart home systems.Alibaba Integrates Waltonchain into IoT AllianceIn a preemptive maneuver to unify the providers of IoT devices and set standards of how companies will support this new industry, Alibaba has formed the IoT Connectivity Alliance.The ICA is an important step toward a stable IoT ecosystem — without interoperability between company platforms, the burgeoning industry will continue to fragment and crumble under its own weight.ICA alliance has announced Xiamen Zhongchuan Internet of Things Industrial Research Institute, a subsidiary of Waltonchain, as one of the 300 members of their Alliance.WTC’s integration of blockchain technologies into the IoT ecosystem will improve manufacturers ability to validate, maintain and verify their products on a decentralized platform.Genuine, Trustworthy and Traceable Goods to Provide Trust in China’s E-commerce MarketWaltonchain provides cost-effective use cases at every level of IoT ecosystem. The WTC blockchain integration has already seen use within supply chain management, companies such as Septwolves, Lipson Plastic, and SMEN have been using Waltonchain RFID tags to increase stock turnover by 5.8%and triple inventory efficiency.Waltonchain is a genuine, trustworthy and traceable business ecosystem with complete data sharing and absolute information transparency.Waltonchain’s ability to support sidechains and smart contracts also provides companies to create tailor-made data structures that can be custom built to suit the business’ needs.In the case of IoT devices, the company’s sidechain could act as a validation mechanism for the device, ensuring the device is certified, up to date and operating within specifications.These side chains also provide interoperability with other sidechains and the parent chain, allowing devices from different manufacturers to operate in a transparent and interconnected manner. By creating secure transactions on the blockchain, this level of openness and transparency may also be accessible by the user, providing feedback and analytics of which devices been communicating with each other in a verifiable manner.Secure Transactions Create a Secure EcosystemThe IoT alliance is aware of the many issues faced by this new industry — it’s existence is an acknowledgment of the reluctance present within the IoT device industry to provide adequate device support standards. The IoT Alliance website states:“ [ICA]actively cooperated with various industry standardization organizations to establish cooperation and complementarities, and has broken through the existing fragmented technology standards to address the current industry standards fragmentation of the Internet of Things, interoperability and lack of security capabilities and other pain points”This behavior has already caused waves of concern within Internet security communities, as these ‘headless’ servers are often co-opted into botnets. As manufacturers discontinue support for their device’s software after a few short years, they are left vulnerable to malicious software that abuses their internet connectivity to perform DDOS attacks or act as points of ingress for the rest of the network.By tying these devices to a blockchain that requires verification and validation procedures before accessing the open internet, device manufacturers may be able to mitigate the ongoing maintenance issues associated with their software.Should any of these devices outlive their manufacturers or user become dissatisfied with the level of support being provided, the interoperability of sidechains would allow open source communities to provide alternative solutions.The coming decade will see a drastic shift in internet traffic as consumers begin to adopt smart always-on devices that utilized internet connectivity to augment their functionality, network activity will be increasingly dominated by devices talking to and interacting with other devicesThis level of digital integration within people’s lives will require a drastic overhaul to develop an accessible and secure digital marketplace.Blockchains like Waltonchain that provide enterprise level solutions to benefit both customers and companies will prove to be invaluable tools in the changing digital economy. Promising to provide greater transparency and efficiency, solutions such as Waltonchain present the end user with a supply chain they can trust, from start to end.Posted In: China, Altcoins, Enterprise, Partnerships     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
575,CryptoSlate,Monero’s Anti-ASIC Hard Fork Successful Amidst An ASIC Domination Debate,Matthew North,1523962020.0,"In the days following the much anticipated anti-ASIC hard fork on Monero’s network on April 6th, miners who were early to the update managed to double, some even tripled their daily profits by upgrading their machines to match the new network standards.The temporary decrease in hashing power on Monero’s Network on April 6th during the scheduled network upgrade was in part a hard fork triggered by Bitmain’s earlier announcement of the new privacy specialized Antminer X3 ASIC miners in a tweet posted on 15th of March.The giant manufacturer of the popular Antminer mining machines announced the planned release of the new Antminer X3 designed to mine privacy-centric coins such as Monero.We are pleased to announce the Antminer E3, world's most powerful and efficient EtHash ASIC miner. Ordering limit of one miner per user and not available in China.Limited stock, order here now: https://t.co/Zfw3afjJHs#antminerE3 pic.twitter.com/SjHu2eUThp— BITMAIN [Not giving away ETH] (@BITMAINtech) April 3, 2018Right after the announcement, Bitmain’s Antminer X3 came head to head with a notable tweet from Riccardo Spagni (lead developer at Monero) reminding the Monero community that the Antminer X3 would not work on the updated Monero network.In his post, he retweeted Bitmain’s post in a move that showed Monero’s determination to execute on the scheduled ASIC resistance changes that were to be implemented on the network before the shipping of the new Antminer.Just a reminder that this WILL NOT work on Monero https://t.co/rhy6k2I4Yh— Riccardo Spagni (@fluffypony) March 15, 2018Maintaining the ASIC resistance raceIn the same thread, concern over the longevity of the anti-ASIC hard fork strategy was questioned by a Twitter user.  To respond to this, Spagni mentioned that since it takes about 5 months for development of Bitmain’s miners to be complete and ready for shipping, Monero will be changing its PoW protocol every 3 months to maintain ASIC resistance status making it hard for the ASIC chip manufacturer to outpace the network.It takes AT LEAST 5 months to design, tape out, and take delivery of ASICs. We can merge the PoW change 3 months before our regular hard fork and they won’t be able to outpace the network.— Riccardo Spagni (@fluffypony) March 15, 2018The reason behind the ASIC Resistance RaceRight after the tweets from Spagni confirming Monero’s anti-ASIC hard fork that would render Antminer X3 obsolete were received, Bitmain updated its Antiminer X3 sales page with the following:“One major cryptocurrency which is using CryptoNight hash function is about to change their PoW algorithm, and according to their public statement, it is purposely to brick ASIC mining rigs including X3. When you are buying it, you are betting that they are wrong.”The war against ASIC miners has been ongoing in the crypto space for a while. Monero’s strategy, according to Spagni, is to come up with unpredictable proof of work mathematical models that will keep companies such as Bitmain from coming up with dedicated machines that would enable certain miners to have a monopoly over the network through owning the more powerful ASIC miners.Related Story: How Bitmain Will Ruin Ethereum Miners: Performance Analysis of the E3 ASICIn the crypto world, the phenomenon where a network loses its decentralized and democratic attribute due to a huge stake held by ASIC miner owners is called centralization.In fact, the ASIC centralization debate has been the main problem faced by the Bitcoin Blockchain, such that manufacturers and miners with more powerful ASIC miners are able to control the overall decision making of the entire network.The inevitable ASIC dominationAlthough Monero is determined to remain ASIC resistant for the long run, there have been critics in the crypto space saying that the fight against ASIC miners won’t last long.Furthermore, a blog from Monero’s site admitted that although ASIC resistant changes will continue to be made, the ASICs may be inevitable “and that any transition to an ASIC dominated network needs to be as egalitarian as possible to foster decentralization.”Posted In: Monero, Altcoins, Mining, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
576,CryptoSlate,Golem Launches on Ethereum Mainnet,Peter Ivancic,1523761920.0,"A year and a half after completing its successful $8 million ICO, Golem’s “Brass” beta is up and running on the Ethereum mainnet. As one of the first major milestones on the GNT roadmap, Brass serves as a proof of concept to present early investors with a basic platform to test the network.Prorsum et sursum ad excellentiam. Golem is proud to announce we have finally launched our Brass Beta into mainnet. We still have a lot of work to do – but this marks a new beginning for us – read our blog → https://t.co/Nc8FgC9uq8— golem (@golemproject) April 10, 2018Golem announced itself to the market as the “Airbnb” for computers, allowing users to ‘rent’ their unused computational power on its network, creating a worldwide networked supercomputer that provides proportional compensation for both GPU and CPU processing power.Supercomputing By the Masses, For the MassesGolem is a global, open sourced, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access.The concept of cloud supercomputing is not a new one to the computer science community — IBM, Nvidia and Amazon Web Services are just a few of companies providing rentable high-performance computing platforms for customers needing to crunch huge datasets.While these projects may be prohibitively expensive for a regular user, they have seen a massive market within the scientific community where time is an important factor.Communities supporting distributed computing have existed as far back as 1996, where projects such as the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search relied on volunteers to donate their spare processing power and bandwidth to enable Mathematics researchers to compute Mersenne prime numbers.Since then, other projects such as [email protected], [email protected], and Climateprediction.net, have allowed users to users to work on the search for extraterrestrial life and generate climate prediction models.This ecosystem has seen a 21st-century overhaul with the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing creating an app to allow Android and iOS users to contribute to a wide range of projects.Beta Platform Opens Doors to Open Source Render SoftwareWhile Golem’s long-term goal is to provide a more cost-effective open-source alternative to current cloud computing platforms, the team has chosen to narrow down their target specifically to graphics rendering during their Beta release. 3D rendering and CGI are incredibly resource-intensive tasks.Even with high-end cutting-edge hardware, rendering large workspaces can take days, requiring massive amounts of computing power to simulate a model’s physics-based lighting interactions.Users in the Golem marketplace can exchange GNT tokens for 3D rendering power in BlenderThe Golem team has chosen this to be the testing ground for their software, allowing users to spend GNT tokens in exchange for rendering power on the free open source software Blender.Integration with this software allows developers to stress test the potential of the network while providing the necessary feedback to help streamline and debug the platform before integrating with projects in which errors in critical data could be potentially disastrous — such as protein folding or modeling chemical interactions.Alongside this version update, Golem has announced a bug bounty competition. This will allow developers to test the new software and help the main team of Golem developers weed out any problems. Should any third party developer find issues in the software, they will be rewarded from a pool of 500,000 tokens. Based on the impact and likelihood of the bug, developers can earn up to GNT 50,000.BOINC  created an app allowing Android and iOS users to contribute to a wide range of projects.This kind of bug bounty mechanism is commonly used by software companies during public releases. It yields important data during testing phases while rewarding community members and third-party developers for providing constructive feedback in a controlled manner.Once the initial trial process is over, the Golem Network plans to bring a more general purpose computational cloud online.Their next release, Clay Golem, is set to fulfill their goal of providing a global decentralized supercomputer by providing integration with computational chemistry and machine learning frameworks, allowing researchers to interact with users via a simple API.For more information on Golem including price, market cap and social media links, please see our Golem coin profile or read “Introduction to Golem – The Worldwide Supercomputer.”Posted In: Altcoins, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
577,CryptoSlate,Interview with Decred’s Project Lead Jake Yocom-Piatt on Crypto Ad Bans and Market Volatility,Jacob Tuwiner,1523760840.0,"The entire crypto market cap surpassed $800 billion dollars in January of 2018 – since then, the market has retraced to around $330 billion dollars, partly due to cryptocurrency ad bans from Google, Facebook, and Twitter.Decred is a self-governing token, designed to solve Bitcoin’s biggest problems with scalability and governance.Unlike other projects that have a heavy focus on marketing and hype, Decred’s development team is focused entirely on the product.Despite being in the face of opposition from web giants, Decred aims to achieve stability through the use of its decentralized governance model.Meet Decred’s Project LeadThe Decred project is led by the CEO of Company Zero, Jake Yocom-Piatt. Based in Chicago, Yocom-Piatt has worked as an expert source for the Chicago Tribune, in addition to a variety of industry publications.Through his extensive leadership experience, especially in the cryptocurrency space, he’s not so worried about promoting his project or its price – instead, he and his team are focusing on the quality of their work.Interview with Yocom-PiattYocom-Piatt agreed to a phone interview with CryptoSlate to talk about market volatility, the recent cryptocurrency ad bans, and Decred’s development.Q: How has Decred achieved price stability through its unique governance structure?A: “As the vote occurs you get a reward for voting – the process whereby you lock the coins and leave them locked until your voting ticket has been selected creates stability by taking funds off of the exchange… It acts as an incentive for people to hold the currency for a longer time rather than leaving it on the exchange, as opposed to dumping when the price goes down and buying the tokens back again.”Decred has achieved relative stability, even in the midst of the recent cryptocurrency market crash thanks to its unique Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake model – its governance structure requires users to lock their coins to earn a voting ticket.Unique from other cryptocurrencies, Decred not only allows its users to vote, but it also encourages them to vote. In addition to incentivizing Decred’s community to make decisions on future changes, the hybrid PoW/PoS algorithm keeps a substantial amount of Decred off the exchanges and in the pockets of its users.Q: How will Decred survive the crypto ad bans?A: “In terms of surviving the crypto ad bans, we’re doing better than most because we haven’t focused on advertising too much in the first place.”The development team has barely scratched the surface when it comes to advertising – rather than focusing on marketing before development, Decred’s team develops the coin ahead of time.Moreover, rather than spending thousands on marketing, Decred releases updates via platforms such as Twitter and its blog.Other projects are likely to see a drop in popularity after the termination of their ad campaigns – the crypto ad bans are barely a blip on Decred’s radar.Q: Do you have any comments on Decred’s price retracement over the past nine months, since June of 2017?A: “It’s really a signal to noise ratio thing. We can only send so much signal when there is so much noise, especially when we’re not spending all of the advertising dollars.We have not focused on the price ourselves. We are trying to build the tech – building the tech is independent of the price. If the price goes up that’s great, but if it goes down, that’s just part of the game.”The altcoin market skyrocketed between January and June of 2017, eventually cooling off in early 2018. The entire cryptocurrency market cap dropped significantly, and Decred has along with it.Q: Why do you think the cryptocurrency market is so volatile?A: “It does not have the benefit of all the infrastructure that we have in all of the other working places… In addition, the value of cryptocurrency is incredibly speculative… It is also a question of network effect. If you look at price spikes, there are speculative runups  in the cryptocurrency space… It is caused by lots and lots of people and the mainstream media suddenly finding out about Bitcoin – it causes prices to go absolutely berserk.”Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile, causing many to shy away from such a risky investment. Market speculation is responsible for their value – this allows for third-parties to have a powerful impact on market price.Q: In your own words, what sets Decred’s governance system apart from other self-governing tokens like Dash?A: “Decred is trying to be more careful and intentional with its infrastructure as opposed to being the first one to have infrastructure… We take the approach of asking not only does it work, but does it work correctly… Everybody wants to build the fastest plane, but nobody wants the fastest plane to blow up in flight. We’re trying to build the fastest plane, but engineer it properly.”Decred is not the first token to develop a system of self-governance. Dash is a top-15 cryptocurrency by market cap, and its team has been working on development since 2006.Decred’s team is implementing a form of soft governance and hard governance with their new consensus system named Politeia – a word taken from ancient Greek, meaning the machinery of the state.Essentially, Politeia is Git with timestamping. The current Git framework does not show when a commit is made – Politeia gives its users cryptographic identities, showing who is suggesting a consensus change and when they are doing so. This cryptographic identity prevents forgery and furthers Decred’s progress towards an entirely decentralized governance model.Complete decentralization is the coin’s end goal, but there are centralized entities along the way working on the token.Users can vote on soft-governance suggestions. Once approved, the Decred team will code the changes and put them on the Decred chain, and users vote on the changes once again. The changes will be automatically implemented on the network after a successful majority vote.Lastly, Decred’s platform incentivizes its users to stake their tokens by rewarding voters with DCR on top of returning the entirety of their staked tokens.Mainstream AdoptionThe Lightning Network is cryptocurrency’s best chance at mainstream adoption.Related Story: Bitcoin Lightning Network Beta Is Now LiveIf we want to use Bitcoin to buy something online, it may be doable, but it’s still complicated. One has to download a wallet, paste the recipient’s address, enter the exact amount of Bitcoin, wait for the transaction to be confirmed, etc.In today’s fast-paced society, the public does not want to adopt this “complicated” system for everyday transactions.The Lightning Network will make transactions nearly instantaneous, in addition to making them more private. The vendor you are paying cannot see how much Bitcoin you are holding in your wallet. The Lightning Network provides incredibly limited information about the wallet balance of the sender and recipient. Lastly, the Lightning Network will dramatically reduce transaction fees.The Future of DecredYocom-Piatt is looking forward to three technical developments in particular:Politeia votingSPV support for Decred’s walletLightning NetworkPeople can post and review proposals and leave comments using Politeia that are cryptographically immutable. However, voting has not been implemented yet. Once voting is added to Politeia, it will give sovereignty to stakeholders over the development organization model.SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) support is another enormous step in the right direction for Decred. Fundamentally, the software scans the blockchain, only downloading relevant blocks to your wallet. This software lightens the load on your device by taking the vast majority of the blockchain out of the equation.Most projects use a service that connects to apps to perform the same task. The service holds all of the information contained in your wallet, except for the private key. SPV keeps this data out of the hands of a third-party and in the hands of Decred’s users.Lastly, Decred is getting ready to implement the Lightning Network – it will be a compelling addition to the project. The Lightning Network is revolutionary for scalability – it is crypto’s best chance at mainstream adoption, due to its similarity to traditional fiat currency and banking.ConclusionDecred has fallen victim to the cryptocurrency market’s recent price retracement – although, it does not necessarily reflect poorly on the project or its team. Yocom-Piatt and Company Zero are competent developers and their unique vision for their token has propelled Decred up the crypto rankings by market cap.Some might argue that the team should focus more on marketing, as it could help increase the value and popularity of the coin. However, the Decred team understands that producing a worthy product is the most critical task at hand.Related Story: An Introduction to Decred (DCR) – Autonomous Digital CurrencyDecred’s unique and incentivized self-governance structure has helped it achieve stability in a highly volatile market.

578,CryptoSlate,Is Verge the Next BitConnect? Ongoing Inconsistencies Alert Crypto Community,Sam Town,1523755500.0,"Privacy-focused cryptocurrency Verge is a divisive topic within the cryptocurrency community. While staunch Verge supporters are quick to decry “FUD” at any and all negative news regarding their favored coin, an increasing amount of evidence that the project may be a large-scale exit scam is manifesting — notably, the disappearance of over 18 million XVG from the Verge “fundraising” wallet.The credibility of Verge has taken a hit recently due to extensive Wraith protocol release delays and allegations of paid pumping by John McAfee. While Verge proponents have vehemently defended the token over recent months — in spite of a bizarre fundraising request and unsubstantiated partnership announcements — the increasingly erratic actions of the Verge development team are becoming impossible to ignore.Related Story: On the Verge of ControversyThe latest development in the ongoing Verge circus is the most concerning to date. Verge recently announced a fundraising project, asking supporters to “donate to support development,” hinting toward a partnership that “represents an enormous potential market with a global reach.”The fundraising effort has, to date, yielded 76.2 million XVG, or a little over $6.4 million USD.While Verge hasn’t provided any specific information on how this capital is to be used, the disappearance of over 18 million XVG from the fundraising wallet on the 13th of April has become a serious source of concern in the cryptocurrency community.As evidenced by publicly available information, 18,600,021 XVG were moved from the fundraising wallet to a Binance exchange wallet on Friday — assumably for immediate liquidation.Verge Team’s Inconsistent Statements Don’t Add UpVerge dev statements on TelegramThe transfer of tokens was met with immediate derision from the cryptocurrency community at large. While the movement of tokens to an exchange wallet is, in itself, cause for immediate alarm, subsequent statements from Verge CEO Justin Sunerok Valo have thrown gasoline onto a FUD fire that threatens to burn the entire project to the ground.The Verge dev team took to the Verge telegram group shortly after the transfer to inform supporters that the XVG was moved to pay Ledger — presumably for Ledger wallet integration. While this may sound reasonable, there are many elements of this explanation that don’t add up.The official Verge Twitter account was also quick to address community concerns, stating that the tokens were being moved to “partnership wallets, where they belong”, requesting that the VergeFam “stop panicking.”#VergeFam,Before the FUD and panic and rumors even start…For those who've been ""monitoring""the donation wallet addresses… $XVG @vergecurrency pic.twitter.com/XLx5yjpffD— Crypto_Life (@_Crypto_Life) April 14, 2018This explanation in itself doesn’t make much sense — it’s unclear why “partner wallets” would consist of one single Binance wallet address — but replies from Ledger representatives shed light on the rapidly deteriorating situation.Ledger CTO, Nicolas Bacca, in reply to community comments in a Reddit thread, stated that the Ledger team is not currently working on Verge integration:“I’m not aware of anybody on our team working on XVG. Maybe some third party is working on it, but I’m not aware of that either.”Bacca’s statements are reinforced by Ledger VP of operations David Balland, who announced on Twitter that Ledger is “not working on any Verge integration.” Fred de Villamil, the Vice President of Engineering at Ledger, clarified the organization’s position on the supposed Verge partnership or integration on Twitter:Except there is no partnership nor planned integration with us.— Fred de Villamil 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ (@fdevillamil) April 14, 2018Verge’s justification for the transfer of XVG from the fundraising wallet to Binance, based on the above information, is clearly untenable. As if outright denial from the Ledger team of any XVG integration is not damning enough, however, further statements from the Verge development team are inconsisent.A community screenshot of Verge dev team statementsIn response to concrete evidence, the Verge dev team advised Telegram group members that they “started a conversation with Ledger” and “got pricing for integration,” planning on “picking the conversation back up next week once (they) had funds.”Sounds reasonable? Not according to de Villamil, who has stated explicitly that Ledger does not charge for integration:“Ledger does not charge for coin integration anymore. Either the integration is provided by the community, which we help for free,  or we follow our own integration roadmap. Have a nice day.”Further inconsistencies include statements from Verge core marketing team member PhanTi, who announced via Twitter that Verge has not yet talked to Ledger:We -obviously- didn't talk to Ledger so far, we just separate the funds for the single projects. We are pretty busy handling the stuff for tuesday, ledger is secondary this weekend.— PhanTi (@PhanTi_91) April 14, 2018At this stage, it’s clear that the XVG transferred to Binance are not intended to be delivered to the Ledger team — who don’t want them anyway. Verge proponents are struggling to defend the actions of the Verge dev team, who have presented inconsistent reasoning for the transaction.Verge Founder’s Checkered PastThere are many ways to determine the likelihood of a Verge scam. The same rules that can be applied to the assessment of an initial coin offering can be applied to Verge — the most important factor to consider when determining whether a blockchain project is fraudulent or not is the team behind it.The history of the team behind Verge — specifically Verge founder and CEO Justin “Sunerok” Valo — is colorful indeed. Valo may currently operate as the leader of the Verge team, but his less recent history provides interesting insight into the credibility of the project as a whole.The Verge Medium blog team post describes “Sunerok” as possessing “20+ years in network security” and “6+ years in blockchain.” Publicly available conviction and arrest information, however, shows that from 2003 to 2010, Verge founder Justin “Sunerok” Valo was arrested eight times on a variety of charges including criminal mischief, prowling, traffic violations, and failure to appear in court.Justin “Sunerok” ValoOther arrest information from Charlotte County shows that Valo has been arrested for trespassing, giving a false name, and the possession of schedule 1 narcotics.While a history of criminal convictions doesn’t necessarily mean that Valo is unqualified to pilot the Verge project, it is worth factoring into a nuanced analysis of Verge’s credibility.It should be noted, however, that many other blockchain industry innovators possess a criminal history — such as Bitcoin core developer Craig Wright, Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, and industry veteran Charlie Shrem.Is Verge a Scam?Related Story: Introduction to Verge (XVG) – The Future of PrivacyThe facts of the matter, when presented in simple terms, are incriminating indeed. Verge transferred fundraising capital earmarked for “partnership development” to an exchange wallet, then misled the community about why. In the world of cryptocurrency, if a project looks like a scam and acts like a scam, it’s probably a scam.A single concerning factor — such as a delayed deadline, strange fundraising requests, or even paying shills to pump a token — isn’t enough to label a blockchain project as an exit scam. The criminal history of the project’s founder combined with the above factors alongside outright deception of the Verge community, however, is worrying indeed.Until an exit scam occurs, it’s too early to conclusively state that Verge is a scam — but Occam’s razor dictates that it may be likely.Posted In: Altcoins, Opinion, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
579,CryptoSlate,Zcash Powers of Tau Privacy Ceremony Successful — The Secret Process Behind Zcash,Mitchell Moos,1523680320.0,"Zcash is one of the first cryptocurrency to build privacy into a blockchain-based currency. This privacy is derived from a mysterious process called “The Ceremony.”How Bitcoin Handles PrivacyRelated Story: Related Story: Introduction to Zcash (ZEC) – Zero-Knowledge CryptographyPeople think that Bitcoin is anonymous. Yet, it has come to light that there is little privacy on the Bitcoin network. Although Bitcoin addresses are pseudo-anonymous, it is possible for someone to analyze the Bitcoin ledger and deduce the identity of people using their transaction history.By linking addresses and transactions together, law enforcement officials and criminals could deduce the identities of Bitcoin users.The Man Behind ZcashZooko Wilcox, founder of ZcashZooko Wilcox, a Colorado-based security specialist, was an early contributor to the Bitcoin protocol.He recognized the privacy deficiencies in Bitcoin and wanted to improve upon it.According to Wilcox in a podcast on NPR, the biggest strength of Bitcoin is also a substantial weakness regarding privacy: “One of the strongest factors of Bitcoin, it’s transparency, could also put people’s privacies at risk.”This was a deal-breaker for Wilcox who believes that privacy is a necessary human right:“[Privacy is a] necessary condition for the exercise of free choice, morality, intimacy, and political participation.”Unfortunately, building such features into Bitcoin in 2016 would prove near-impossible with the community’s resistance to modify the core protocol. However, Wilcox was convinced that a digital currency with the decentralization of Bitcoin and privacy of cash is possible. From that idea, Zcash (Zero Cash) was born.The Mechanics Behind ZcashThe Zcash private “shielded” ecosystemZcash uses Bitcoin’s core code and improves upon the anonymity aspect of transactions. Zcash utilizes a cryptographic method known as “zero-knowledge proofs,” which leverages complex mathematics to prove a piece of information is true without revealing anything about that underlying piece of information.These zero-knowledge methods are baked into the Zcash protocol as zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) and enable most of the security features that characterize Zcash.The most important feature is “shielded transactions.” A shielded transaction is the term for a private transaction using zk-SNARKs on the Zcash network.Unlike other methods by cryptocurrencies to provide user privacy, shielded addresses look identical to observers of the Zcash blockchain allowing for unprecedented levels of transaction privacy in 2016.The Catch to zk-SNARKsHowever, zk-SNARKs comes with a catch. Implementing the system has a huge vulnerability, at least at inception. The security of zk-SNARKs is predicated on a seed, an enormous randomly generated number, that must remain secret to ensure the security of the protocol.If someone were to uncover the key that zk-SNARKs are built upon, then that person could mint millions of Zcash out of thin air.However, even if the key were compromised the privacy of the system would remain intact. Every shielded address on the system is protected “solely by mathematics (modern encryption) and do not rely on anything else for their privacy.”The Privacy Ceremony that Makes it PossibleFor Zcash to succeed, it is imperative that the way the key is generated is trustable and transparent. For such a herculean feat, Wilcox concocted the plan to conduct:“the most secure and most sophisticated cryptographic ceremony that has ever been performed.”The Sprout ceremony, the privacy ceremony to initialize Zcash, was scrutinized to the smallest detail. The founding team wanted to ensure every possible security risk was taken into account and wanted to prove the process was untainted to the public. To do so here are a few precautions the team made:Filmed every portion of the ceremony and released it to the public.Filmed the filming equipment to prove that the first set of equipment wasn’t tampered with.Purchased new computers for the sole purpose of generating the key.Generation of the key was split over six participants to reduce the risk that all six of them were compromised.All mediums, computers, and memory which interacted with the key were dismembered, destroyed, and burned.For additional details on the Sprout ceremony, check out this NPR podcast done in collaboration with the Zcash founders.The day after launch Zcash peaks at $5,400When Zcash launched on October 28th, it was sensational. The first cryptocurrency to implement a strong privacy component to a blockchain. Following launch day the price of a single Zcash peaked at $5,300 when Bitcoin was trading at less than $720.The Privacy Ceremony 2.0Recently, the Zcash team successfully conducted a second ceremony: the “Power of Tau” privacy ceremony. The second ceremony upgraded many of the security features in the Zcash protocol.However, unlike the first ceremony, the Powers of Tau was open to the public and included hundreds of participants across the globe.The Power of Tau ceremony was similar to the Sprout ceremony, but the process was improved to allow the inclusion of a scalable number of participants. As described by the Zcash Foundation:“You can think of this process as a bit like shuffling a deck of cards in public. Each participant shuffles the deck, proves that they did not modify or add any of the cards, and then hands the deck to the next participant.”Additionally, the more participants in the ceremony, the more secure the process becomes. Unlike the Sprout ceremony where the onus of proof was on the six members who generated the key, in an open system:“As long as one participant successfully destroys their randomness when they’re finished, the resulting parameters are secure. As more and more participants are added, it becomes unlikely that an adversary could have compromised everyone.”Each of these participants is then able to attest to the successful completion of the process.Upgrades to the Zcash ProtocolWith the Power of Tau successfully implemented there were a few notable improvements to Zcash.Security features in Zcash now require much less computation. Previously, a huge amount of computing and memory power was necessary to conduct Zcash shielded (term for the protocol’s private) transactions, which limited its use on the network.The Power of Tau ceremony will become the primary updating process for the protocol, allowing for a more transparent and trustworthy process for updating Zcash.Controversy Surrounding zk-SNARKs UsageA controversy surrounding Zcash is the limited use of the protocol’s private transactions. Many users do not know how to enable zk-SNARKs on the network, or the other hoops to jump through are too onerous for a typical user.The reduction in computational intensity should make use a little more widespread. However, if there is still an insufficient userbase for shielded transactions, then the security of the whole system is harmed.According to official Zcash website, the more people who enable the security feature, the more secure the network is as a whole. Ideally, more than 50% transactions on the network would use zk-SNARKs which would help obfuscate the identity of other visible transactions on the network.Advanced network statistics on ZcashHowever, when a smaller percentage of users utilize shielded addresses, then “it’s relatively trivial to assume that shielded addresses on average have a higher balance, making them a higher target for attempts at theft.” On top of that, a hacker could use network timestamps from unshielded transactions to deduce the identity of shielded transaction users.Currently, only 14% of Zcash transactions are shieldedConclusions on the Zcash CryptocurrencyZcash is one of the first cryptocurrency to implement completely private transactions successfully. Not only that, the Zcash team is still on the cutting-edge of digital currency privacy with many other cryptocurrencies following their lead.Even with the deficiencies of Zcash, future Power of Tau ceremonies will continue to enhance the security and efficiency of the Zcash network.For more information about Zcash including price, market cap, technical information and social media links, please see our Zcash coin profile or read our post entitled “Introduction to Zcash (ZEC) – Zero-Knowledge Cryptography.”Posted In: Zcash, Altcoins, Privacy, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
580,CryptoSlate,IOTA’s Impending Trinity Desktop Wallet Launch Catalyzes Price Recovery,Sam Town,1523672340.0,"Thursday’s unexpected short squeeze resulted in a sudden and dramatic price spike across the entire cryptocurrency market. With Bitcoin gaining over $1,000 USD in less than one hour, many altcoins have experienced similar stratospheric surges. IOTA, however, is experiencing a prominent return to the positive, breaking out of a long descending price run as investor faith is restored in the flagging market.Related Story: Fujitsu Executive Rolf Werner Joins IOTA FoundationRecent IOTA news has seen Fujitsu executive Rolf Werner join the IOTA foundation, which contributed to positive investor sentiment, but the most interesting announcement to come from from the IOTA development team recently is the announcement of the upcoming Trinity desktop wallet launch.A March update outlined the current developmental state of IOTA’s highly anticipated Trinity wallet app, which is now in a security audit stage.IOTA developer Navin Ramachandran stated in the update that, while the app project has been hindered by a lack of standardization within coding guidelines exacerbated by a failure to communicate accurate timelines with the IOTA community, the Trinity wallet app is already in an alpha stage of testing.Related Story: German University RWTH Plans to Implement IOTA for Industrial Use CasesWhile the Trinity wallet app may still be awaiting app store approval and security auditing, the Trinity desktop wallet is slated for alpha testing in the first half of April.According to a recent Reddit post published by  Trinity Core Developer Charlie Varley, hundreds of new users are now being registered to the Trinity desktop wallet testing group.What the Trinity Wallet Launch Means for IOTAWork on IOTA’s user-friendly wallet application has been underway for several months, with a release expected at the conclusion of the security audit in 6-7 weeks time. Ramachandran, in answer to the question “when Trinity”, posted this response:“When this audit is complete we can move to a public beta test where everyone can try out the mobile wallet via the official app stores, without any special invitation. At this time, we will also release the full audit report and the complete source code for public review.”The cross-platform approach the IOTA team has taken in the development of the Trinity wallet app, however, will likely speed up the progression of the Trinity desktop app shift from private alpha to public beta.Related Story: Introduction to IOTA – The Economy of ThingsThe release of both a desktop and mobile IOTA-specific wallet app is set to significantly improve investor sentiment toward the slow-moving IOTA project — the proposed app offers a number of elements that would position it as one of the most feature-rich wallets available.In addition to standard wallet features such as seed storage and generation, the Trinity wallet also delivers multiple seeds, as well as a “statefulness” feature that records all transactions and balances in order to overcome issues presented by IOTA’s “snapshot” function.The new #Trinity wallet is stateful — which should overcome the problem when you are on a single device and a snaphshot occurs! Follow us to be part of the #IOTA revolution! #crypto #crytocurrency #iotatokennews #apple #android #iphone #ipad @iotatoken @DomSchiener @DavidSonstebo pic.twitter.com/Fhu6zPMMDs— IOTA News (@iotatokennews) January 8, 2018IOTA uses a unique consensus method called Tangle, which essentially causes every network participant to function as a node as well as a user.This method, while extremely innovative, can cause the “Tangle” to expand in size dramatically — to the point where it becomes unwieldy.To prevent this from occurring, snapshotting saves all balances, while removing all transaction data and history.This process is best visualized with the image below — grey addresses represent the “tips” of the Tangle, which function as “new” Genesis addresses subsequent to a snapshot.The Trinity wallet app incorporates a “snapshot transition feature,” which — according to Charlie Varley — involves simply confirming wallet balance when snapshots occur. After this point users need only retain their seed in Trinity, which automates the transition process.Other features offered by the Trinity wallet app include paper wallet generation, multi-language support, and QR scanning.The Future of IOTAIOTA’s attempt to bring the internet of things onto the blockchain is a monumental task — while the release of a desktop or mobile app isn’t a great milestone in the grand scheme of IOTA’s vision, it will dramatically boost the adoption of IOTA, which will yield a net positive effect on the value of the token.Providing users with an easy to use, an intuitive wallet is a critical step toward the success of any project — a feature that the IOTA dev team is set to deliver to their community in the very near future.For more information about IOTA including price, market cap, technical information and social media links, please see our IOTA coin profile.Posted In: IOTA, Adoption, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
581,CryptoSlate,Blockchain Projects Battle for Health Records,David Lee,1523501040.0,"Vulnerable to massive data hacks, siloed from effective communication, and frustrating to patients and healthcare providers alike, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are ripe for disruption.Some of EHR’s greatest problems include interoperability, accessibility, and security. From examples like Equifax to Anthem Blue Cross, centrally-stored data has often proved vulnerable and lucrative in the modern age of cyber attacks and data leaks. Its estimated that health data breaches cost approximately $6.2 billion each year.Blockchain technology is poised to provide five major improvements to EHR systems, including:A complete and easily accessible health recordPatient controlSecurityImproved data quality and quantity for medical researchReduced costs through interoperabilityCompanies in the SpaceSimilaritiesFor the most part, all five projects aim to give patients full control and access to their information as one complete record.  Through smart contracts, patients can also choose who to give permission to view and edit their records.All five projects will also provide improved security.  In general, a company’s blockchain will only contain the hashed value of a patient’s data, which will act as “breadcrumbs” to locate the patient’s encrypted information off-chain. Having a patient’s information spread throughout decentralized nodes will prevent there from being one point-of-failure and protect sensitive data from hacking and forgery.ComparisonsTeam LocationAs you can see, the five projects are located in North America, Europe, and Asia.  Location is an important factor as different countries have different healthcare laws and markets.Qtum is a Chinese blockchain project that uses smart contracts and PoS 3.0.Medibloc, which is based out of South Korea, is currently focused on serving the Asian market.  This is one of the reasons it is built on Qtum, a Chinese-based blockchain.Medichain and Medicalchain are both based in the United Kingdom.  Although both companies are working towards improving EHRs, Medicalchain is focused on using a patient’s health data to provide telemedicine consults, saving the patient time and money.Medichain’s emphasis is on improving research by allowing patients to sell their anonymized data to researchers and companies. This provides researchers insightful population-wide data that can be used to improve evidence-based and precision medicine.Medchain and Patientory are both based in the United States and primarily focused on the main problem of interoperability and information exchange.  Both companies will work to provide a HIPAA-compliant product that acts as an intermediary between existing EHR systems and their respective blockchain ecosystems.Medchain will soon be offering a Regulation A+ ICO.Patientory’s ICO finished in June 2017. The project had some transparency issues in late 2017, claiming its app was pending FDA approval but has since remodeled its approach.Looking ForwardBlockchain technology has the potential to drastically improve the management of healthcare records.  The decentralized nature and immutable ledger of blockchain provide a secure, transparent, and easily accessible record for patients and providers alikeIn addition, the unique properties of this technology provide additional avenues to improve healthcare and the companies working in this space should be closely followed.Posted In: Adoption, Altcoins, ICOs     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

They go far beyond machine-to-machine payments and include, for example, tamper-proof monitoring of the supply chain and secure identity management, just to name a few.”IOTA is primarily known in the crypto market for its ‘blockless distributed ledger’ technology called Tangle. In recent months the company has been actively seeking avenues via which it can deploy its propriety digital offering for industrial use cases.Fujitsu Ltd. is a Japanese multinational information technology equipment and services company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan.It is also worth mentioning that minutes after the hiring of Werner was made public, IOTA backers took to Reddit and other social platforms to give their seal of approval for the move.Several Redditors lauded IOTAs steadfast approach to driving innovation within the IoT market as well as fostering large-scale innovation within the blockchain sector.What comes out of this partnership remains to be seen, but from the outside-looking-in, this move seems to be a step in the right direction for the IOTA Foundation.For more information IOTA, please check out our IOTA coin profile or read our coin intro, “Introduction to IOTA – The Economy of Things.”Posted In: IOTA, Japan, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
583,CryptoSlate,XMR Identity Crisis: Monero Undergoes Five-Way Split,Peter Ivancic,1523413140.0,"Monero, the world’s largest privacy coin by market cap, underwent an emergency hard-fork as an active measure against miner centralization.Monero’s latest Version 12 update marks a significant milestone for the currency. With the recent release of the BK-N miner from Baikal and the Antminer X3 from Bitmain, the core XMR communities stance against specified mining cards has seen its user base splinter into five separate currencies.Monero is an open-source cryptocurrency that focuses on privacy, decentralization, and scalability.These mining cards are implementations of ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuit), hardware geared towards the Crypotnight hashing algorithm, and offer a considerable performance advantage over CPU or GPU miners.Dedicated mining hardware brings massive amounts of hashing power into the hands of a concentrated group of users, disrupting the power dynamic within the XMR community and leading to a consolidation of power in the network.ASICs have existed for a long time in the cryptocurrency space. Companies such as Bitmain produce miners catering to a range of hashing algorithms including SHA256 and Scrypt.However, for the XMR community — which places a strong emphasis on decentralization — these cards cause significant concern, with many community members labeling such cards as a “threat.”The position of the Monero community on dedicated mining hardware stems from the origins of Monero itself — fueled by an ideological diversion from Bitcoin’s development, Monero prioritizes privacy and an egalitarian mindset, opting for fair distribution of mining power throughout the network.Specialized Hardware Centralizes Mining PowerIn an official post released in February, the Monero team “recognized that ASICs might be an inevitable development for any Proof of Work” algorithm but maintains that XMR is committed to cultivating balance in its mining community, stating:“In order to maintain its goal of decentralization and to provide a deterrent for ASIC development and to protect against unknown or undetectable ASIC development, the Monero team proposes modifying the Cryptonight PoW hash every scheduled fork, twice a year”Related Story: Ethereum Community Considers Hard Fork To Combat Bitmain’s ASIC MinerThe developers also endeavor to remind the community that adoption of the Cryptonight PoW function was adapted from the initial CryptoNote implementation to eliminate the disparity between CPU (majority) and GPU/FPGA/ASIC (minority) miners.Monero’s official statement on the algorithm change also goes to great lengths to reaffirm the teams “somewhat formal stance” against ASICs, outlining their plans and reasoning as to why the developers will combat the current wave of Cryptonight-specific miners.“Cryptonight (Monero’s proof-of-work system) intends to close the gap between CPU and GPU, FPGA, and ASIC mining by using a proof-of-work system that is memory bound over a moderate amount of memory. As a result, ASICs get significantly more expensive to build.”There have been many conversations amongst Monero community members regarding how XMR should maintain their ASIC resistance, including transitioning their hashing algorithm to the Cuckoo Cycle. The feature list on Monero’s latest Github release, however, only states a “tweaked PoW.”It appears that the recent update has already achieved its desired goal, as recent statistics already show a greater diversification of power within the XMR mining pools — albeit at the cost of global hashing power.Hard Fork Spawns Five New ProjectsFive new projects have spawned as a direct response to this hardline policy against specified Cryptonight mining cards, all of which are operating on the ASIC compatible Version 11 XMR code. These cards include:Monero ClassicMonero-ClassicMonero 0Monero OriginalMoneroCNew projects emerging from significant forks is a common occurrence in the crypto ecosystem, with coins such as Ethereum Classic, OmiseGo Classic, and Zclassic all providing users with legacy features dropped from mainline release.Related Story: Bitmain Could Be Developing Facilities In the United StatesHowever, none are currently as popular as the core projects from which they were launched, with many being denounced as “scams.” Some, however, such as ETC, maintain an enthusiastic community support base.These new forks may still be able to find a niche for themselves in the market. While many claim ASIC-compatible Monero forks will be dominated by large mining institutions, network speed and increased validation times will continue to be a selling point for new forks.Proponents of specialized hardware suggest that the Monero fork will stunt the token’s growth, potentially hampering its ability to scale.With multiple mining hardware manufacturers producing Cryptonight capable ASICs, consensus dominance may be dictated by the rate at which miners adopt specialized hardware. The much more mature ASIC-accepting BTC mining pools, for example, have one entity controlling no more than 26% of gross hashing power.While the fate of these new forks is yet to be fully realized, Monero’s main chain continues to be a key player in the privacy coin sector with total market cap well over double of its closest competitor.Posted In: Monero, Altcoins, Mining, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
584,CryptoSlate,Bitfinex Adds 12 New Cryptocurrencies to Its Existing Altcoin Portfolio,Shiraz Jagati,1523147340.0,"One of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex, has just announced the addition of 12 new tokens to its trading platform.Boasting of a 24-hour trade volume of more than USD $380 million, the online trading giant provides its customer base with a wide array of cutting-edge features that allow for seamless currency exchange.

We are proud to introduce these tokens as we believe that each serves to strengthen and enliven a unique aspect of the global blockchain ecosystem, and will offer new and exciting trading options for our users.”It is also worth mentioning that the new tokens will be tradable against BTC, ETH, and USD and that margin trading and peer-to-peer lending markets will be “enabled gradually”, as and when order books start to develop sufficient liquidity.Lastly, in the midst of all these announcements, Bitfinex devs also confirmed that they will be adding support for Ethereum-based stablecoin, DAI, to their platform.By integrating DAI and USDT, Bitfinex aims to bridge the gap that exists between these disparate markets and hopes to facilitate new trading opportunities across a “diverse range of tokens, markets, and exchanges.”Posted In: Bitfinex, Altcoins, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
585,CryptoSlate,Major Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against NANO,News Desk,1523096400.0,"So, for all those that haven’t had a chance to follow the NANO (formerly known as RaiBlocks) saga, there apparently has been a new development in the fallout from the BitGrail hack.A Brief Overview of the HackTo backpedal for a second, on February 8, 2018, news of a massive hack of NANO tokens from the exchange, BitGrail, was “teased” to the general public via a tweet from their Twitter account.XRB Markets currently unavailable.— BitGrail Exchange (@BitGrail) February 8, 2018Whalepool was the first major crypto user/publication to break the news in the form of a formal write-up the following day on February 9, 2018.Nano/RaiBlocks Exchange BitGrail was hacked for over 17 Million $XRB. Owner of exchange asked Core Devs to change the ledger and make him whole. Core Devs said no, contacted the police. https://t.co/kWC6u9Y7Qi— Whalepool (@whalepool) February 9, 2018From that point, the situation began to devolve.The owner of the BitGrail exchange, Francesco ‘The Bomber’ Firano, was the individual whom was in contact with the NANO developers during the hack itself.Early reports that came out on February 8, 2018, from other Twitter users had alleged that Firano (owner of the BitGrail Exchange) was trying to negotiate with the NANO team to initiate a hard-fork to reverse the illicit transactions that were made from stealing money out of the exchange’s hot wallets.The NANO team refused to oblige to the exchange owner’s hard-fork request. This led to the ensuing standoff between the two parties in which each blamed the other’s negligence/competence for the loss of the NANO tokens.The first blow between NANO and Francesco was struck by ‘The Bomber’ when he put out a tweet on February 9, 2018, stating that the NANO team’s unwillingness to initiate a hard-fork was the reason why users were still deprived of the currency that they had stored on the exchange.NANO on BitGrail have been stolen.Unfortunately there is no way to give it back to you at 100% (we only got 4 MLN XRN right now).The devs, as you have guessed, dont want to collaborate— Francesco The Bomber (@bomberfrancy) February 9, 2018The response by the NANO team came on that same day, February 9, 2018, via a Medium post that they published from their official account, which was titled, ‘Official Statement Regarding BitGrail’s Insolvency’.It’s worth noting that the title is worded in such a way as to give the impression that BitGrail’s insolvency prompted them to misappropriate the NANO tokens in order to solve their financial problems.The report by NANO also firmly, without equivocation, places the blame squarely upon BitGrail when it states:“We have no reason to believe the loss was due to an issue in the NANO protocol. The problems appear to be related to BitGrail’s software.”The link to the alleged correspondence between XRB and Francisco can be accessed here.Long Story ShortWhen all was said and done, approximately $150 million worth of NANO were stolen from the BitGrail hot wallets. Firano had announced at one point in time on Twitter that he would pursue legal action against the NANO team itself for defaming him, but has been eerily silent in the weeks since the incident.@nanocurrency We are pressing charges against you due to your irresponsible behavior.— Francesco The Bomber (@bomberfrancy) February 11, 2018The BitGrail exchange was forced to shutter its doors shortly after the hack but posted a press release on March 14, 2017, where they announced a stable token, redeemable for the cash value of $1 per token would be released on their exchange to those that had lost NANO tokens.In this press release, the BitGrail exchange also reaffirms that they believe the hack to be a product of inherent defects in the NANO protocol and not due to any shortcomings on behalf of the BitGrail exchange.Lawsuit Now PendingDespite the extended period of silence on this hack, the story is far from over. As noted earlier, over $150 million in user funds were lost on the exchange. So, a lot of people were significantly affected by the hack or whatever event took place that resulted in the loss of customer funds.It appears that there was already a discussion regarding filing a class action lawsuit against BitGrail on January 30th on NANO’s Reddit (approximately a week and a half before the hack itself).One reply by a user on the NANO subreddit indicated that the Silver Miller Law Firm would be the perfect choice to carry out this proposed class action lawsuit against BitGrail. Below is the post revealing their logic as well as an argument for pursuing such action against BitGrail:View post on imgur.comPlot TwistRather than suing BitGrail, a class action lawsuit was brought by the “Silver Miller Law Firm” (named in the above Reddit comment), against the NANO team.Here is the link to the official press release by the firm announcing the “Securities Class Action Lawsuit Against NANO and Members of its Core Development Team”According to the press release:“Silver Miller has commenced a new class action lawsuit on behalf of investors in NANO f/k/a RaiBlocks (XRB), alleging that NANO and key members of its core team violated federal securities laws and that, in their push to introduce XRB to a wide market of investors, recklessly directed investors to open accounts and place their assets with a little known, and severely troubled, Italian cryptocurrency exchange called BitGrail, where $170 million of the investors’ XRB alleged ‘disappeared’ in February 2018.”There’s Credence to This LawsuitTake a look at the tweet below:We are working closely with @BitGrail on a node issue discovered due to the scale that BitGrail is processing transactions.All funds are safe and we are working closely with them to resume deposits and withdrawals as soon as possible. Thanks for your patience $xrb— Nano (@nanocurrency) January 2, 2018In it, NANO reassures that XRB is not only solvent but that,“All funds are safe and we are working closely with them to resume deposits and withdrawals as soon as possible.”Now, one may be tempted to think, “Well this is probably before they knew the exchange was insolvent.”Unfortunately, this is not the case: Both in the joint Telegram group which hosted  NANO team members and BitGrail executives as well as in various tweets such as the one below, the NANO team received more than enough information from Francesco and others to reasonably come to the conclusion that the exchange was highly susceptible to compromise/issues.Markets under maintenace in order to definitely fix the issue.— BitGrail Exchange (@BitGrail) December 30, 2017There were plenty of indicators that things were not all on the “up and up” with BitGrail’s security/potential solvency, such as the tweet above, which was sent on December 30th, 2017, just 3 days before one of the NANO team members publicly stated that there were no problems with BitGrail’s exchange and that their funds would be 100% safe.This is also evidenced by the NANO community’s response shortly after the exchange hacking took place.This is reflected in user conversation on the Nano Reddit as well.Details of the LawsuitHere is a link to the document (PDF) stating the details of the lawsuit as well as the allegations being made against the NANO team.It’s also worth mentioning that the NANO team is based in the United States, as is the defendant of the lawsuit, so they will most definitely have to answer to this lawsuit. They will also be subject to scrutiny in accordance to the standards/regulations that have been set forth by the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).Below is an excerpt from the lawsuit :Uncertainty Regarding the Amount of Funds the NANO Team Actually OwnsWhat’s most interesting out of all of the preliminary statements listed above is point #2, which states,“The original RaiBlocks White Paper and first beta implementation of XRB were published in December 2014. Since that time, the maximum supply of 133,248,290 XRB has been generated; and Defendants – for their work in conceiving, developing, promoting, and selling XRB to the public – withheld for themselves millions if not tens of millions of XRB, most of which are owned by Defendant LEMAHIEU.” [emphasis added]This noted ambiguity in the amount of XRB that NANO owns hasn’t been touched on much in the crypto community with the exception of this Medium post, which raises some questions regarding the coin movement of XRB by NANO team members. So, it’s definitely interesting to see that this was included in the lawsuit.NANO’s Decision to Not Pursue a Hard-Fork Could Come Back to Bite ThemThe lawsuit also makes the cogent argument that NANO did have the ability to rectify the situation through the use of a hard-fork, but refused – which is technically true.The lawsuit uses this fact to assert that, in not doing so, some of the onus of blame must be placed squarely upon NANO’s shoulders for the customers’ loss of funds – especially in light of the fact that the amount of funds that customers lost were probably exacerbated by the excessive trust that investors placed in NANO’s recommendation of BitGrail.The lawsuit also alleges that “XRB Are Investment Contract Securities that Were Never Registered or Exempted From Registration With Regulatory Authorities,” which is also true.This is a big deal and if the judge presiding over this case agrees with the plaintiff’s argument in this regard, then NANO’s fight to win could be insurmountable.The most surprising claim in the lawsuit, however, is the assertion that,“To fulfill its role in the conspiracy, NANO – by and through Defendants, amongst others – referred thousands of investors to BitGrail to open up accounts at the exchange, in return for which NANO received large payments in connection with XRB being traded on the BitGrail exchange.”ConclusionTo put it nicely, NANO may be in deep trouble. In an actual courtroom, it is possible that NANO will fit the billing as a “security,” according to the Howey Test. There are also numerous clear and unequivocal statements that the team made to investors where they reassured them that the exchange was safe and that they were in no risk despite there being a wealth of evidence to suggest otherwise.And finally, their refusal to initiate the hard-fork as Bomber had requested may come back to bite them as well. Sure, there are philosophical reasons for not wanting to initiate a hard-fork, such as preserving the immutability of the blockchain, but the courts will more than likely not take this into consideration or consider this to be a legitimate excuse during their review of the case.The courts will merely examine whether there is something that XRB/NANO could have done to help users recoup their stolen funds and it’s hard, if not impossible, to argue that a hard-fork wouldn’t have rectified this situation.Would it have hurt NANO’s reputation and potentially caused strife in the community? Sure. But would it have returned the users’ assets to them? Definitely. And the latter is the only question that the courts are mainly concerned with in torts of this nature.So, when looking at everything in its totality, NANO may be in some serious trouble.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
586,CryptoSlate,On the Verge of Controversy,Mitchell Moos,1523067480.0,"The cryptocurrency Verge promised to bring people quick, efficient, and private transactions. Instead, the coin has been embroiled in a series of controversies.Verge is a privacy-focused coin similar to Zcash and Monero. The Verge project integrates some innovative features through the use of the TOR VPN, free software which enables anonymous data transfer, and I2P, another anonymous network that adds another layer of privacy.Verge has had issues, to say the least.McAfee Allegedly Paid to Pump VergeBack in November famous British-American computer programmer and businessman and founder of McAfee Antivirus, John McAfee, was allegedly paid $105,000 to shill the coin.I am inundated by people asking me for recommendations on cryptocurrencies. If you would use your heads you would figure out that the privacy coins (anonymous transactions) will have the greatest future. Coins like Monero (XMR), Verge (XVG), or Zcash (ZEC) cannot lose.— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) December 13, 2017McAfee later asserted that the coin was bound for $15, a far-fetched 150x increase from its price at the time.Following the tweet on December 13th, 2017, the price of Verge spiked from 0.9 cents to 1.5 cents per coin, a 60% increase.The price of Verge exploded after rigorous shilling from John McAfeeThere is still controversy surrounding whether the Verge team or another participant paid McAfee to pump the value of the coin.Wraith Protocol FiascoFollowing the McAfee incident, the Verge team announced on Medium and Twitter that they would release the Wraith Protocol before December 31st of 2017.Wraith Protocol is a technology that allows the user to seamlessly switch between public and private ledgers on the Verge Blockchain.However, the team delayed the release four times. Meanwhile, Verge continued to market the coin aggressively on Twitter. The lack of transparency and the mismanagement of the project caused many Redditors to sell their holdings.One Redditor responded to the incident by selling his 5.5 million Verge said the following: Why I just sold my 5.5 million verge. from vergecurrency Verge’s Odd Fundraising RequestJustin Sunerok, the lead developer for Verge, has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise approximately $3 million in XVG coins, claiming the funds will be used to secure a “strategic business alliance” with an unnamed global organization. The campaign also implies that the donations are for Ledger Nano support, an iOS-enabled wallet application and partnerships with “large-scale companies.”That said, the Reddit community raised red flags. Proceeding the announcement, Sonerok posted on Reddit that his Coinbase is frozen: please upvote! CoinBase has not allowed me to withdraw funds since September 2017, it’s now almost April 2018. from CoinBase Many Redditors have voiced concerns that the fundraising campaign is a scam. A highly-upvoted comment by another Redditor had the following hypothesis:(1) Justin Sunerok is having trouble raising money to pay his taxes. (2) Justin Sunerok launches desperately fast crowdfunding to raise approximately $3 million in XVG tokens. Says it is for a partnership. (3) Justin Sunerok says the partnership will be announced April 16, the day after the final deadline for filing taxes.Although these are still rumors at this point, several indicators raise questions about the fundraising campaign.Verge Forced to Fork After 51% AttackVerge is a proof-of-work currency which derives its security from the decentralization of its network. If a single actor were able to gain majority control of this network, then they would be able to create and modify the blockchain at will.On April 4th, Verge was the target of a 51% attack.We had a small hash attack that lasted about 3 hours earlier this morning, it's been cleared up now. We will be implementing even more redundancy checks for things of this nature in the future! $XVG #vergefam— VergeCurrency (@vergecurrency) April 4, 2018Although Verge asserts that the attack only lasted three hours, some say the attack lasted up to thirteen hours. Additionally, Verge claims that around 250,000 XVG were stolen during the attack while others in the community claim that more than 3.9 million could have been stolen.The Verge team and lead developer Sunerok have exacerbated the issue by underplaying the severity of the attack or denying that it happened. In a Reddit thread requesting to delist Verge on Binance, Sunerok replied with:“it wasnt a 51% attack lol”Sunerok made similar comments in other similar threads bringing light to the attack. Verge hard-forked the coin in response to the attack. Along with an infographic, Verge had this to say on Twitter:To make sure that all stealth transactions will run smoothly, Verge will hard fork at block 1,824,150.A hard fork is a radical change to a blockchain protocol that invalidates all subsequent blocks from the selected block. When a blockchain forks, a permanent divergence is created in the blockchain.A hard-fork has the potential to damage the security of the network by reducing the number of participating nodes during the switch. Moreover, a hard fork violates the principle of immutability that is valued by many in the community.Despite the string of troubling news, Verge is still up 80% from last weekThe crypto community had mixed reactions. On some forums, there are Verge supporters that claim the coin will come back stronger than ever. On the other hand, some believe that the project could be a Ponzi scheme on the level of BitConnect.It appears that the market agrees with the former.Posted In: Altcoins, Opinion, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
587,CryptoSlate,Monero Releases the Source Code For Its New GUI Wallet,Shiraz Jagati,1522841940.0,"With Monero preparing for another hard fork in the coming few days, the dev team has released the source code for its latest GUI Wallet— the Lithium Luna.Monero is a collaborative open-source project that offers crypto enthusiasts with an array of unique features when compared to other big names in the digital market. Project code is updated twice a year which means that after the update, it no longer remains backward compatible.Similarly, with the new update, Monero will revamp its current proof-of-work protocol so that any existing ASIC rigs will no longer be able to mine the currency.A Scheduled Network Upgrade is Planned for April 6: https://t.co/1JQwQlA5di— Monero || #xmr (@monero) March 28, 2018Other developments from this latest release which are particularly noteworthy include:1. Multi-Sig SupportLithium Luna will serve as a multi-signature wallet which means that it can be controlled by more than one individual at any given time. However, for voluminous monetary transactions to be processed, the digital signatures of a majority of vested parties need to be obtained. Interestingly, multisig wallets also have the capacity to execute automated escrow deals.2. Implementation of Sub-AddressesThrough the use of sub-addresses, Monero aims to make digital transactions outside of its native blockchain more air-tight and foolproof. Prior to the release of Lithium Luna, Monero wallets only possessed one receiving address.Related Story: Monero – Privacy and Anonymity on the BlockchainIn many cases, if the receiving address was published across two unique online stores, the identity of the recipient was revealed.However, with this latest update, users have the option to generate infinite (un) linkable sub-receive addresses. This not only allows for more financial flexibility but also allows users to remain completely anonymous when operating outside the Monero blockchain.3. Fluffy BlocksAs things currently stand, transactions taking place within the Monero ecosystem are quite resource-intensive and thus by implementing Fluffy Blocks, the synchronization of data-sets can take place at a much faster pace.To be more specific, a Fluffy Block contains only the block header, transaction IDs, and in some cases, missing transactions. As a result of this, there is a substantial reduction in the volume of data that has to be relayed within the network.To read up more on this latest release,  users can visit the official Monero website.

588,CryptoSlate,VeChain Jumps 25% After Bithumb Listing,Jonnie Emsley,1522652400.0,"South Korean exchange, Bithumb, has given VeChain a new set of legs, spurring on an unlikely price rally amongst a bloody sea of red.The South Korean exchange welcomed VET with a brazen show of support for the product management platform, using it as a rewards mechanism to seduce new users.Unlocking the gates to a 2-part competition, Bithumb is dishing out VeChain to all who transact or deposit on their platform. The official announcement from Bithumb read:VeChain, which is listed after review by Bithumb Cryptocurrency Deliberative Committee, is valued as a service blockchain that can be combined with real life, and is the payment currency used in the VeChain blockchain, which is already spurring development with many partnerships.The eruption of VeChain Thor coincided neatly with the competition’s announcement, with price action stacking near-vertical as bulls frantically placed their buy orders.As the coin approached $3.00,  its 26% growth rate placed VET most favorably amongst the entire market on April 2nd.What’s up for grabs?The event consists of two separate schemes, with the first offering VeChain to all exchange-users trading in quantities larger than 500,000 KRW ($475 USD), exclusively from April 2-6.Despite Bithumb’s extravagant generosity, rewards are modest at best, with the top-tier seeing just 100 VET (approx. $290) for the mind-bending sum of 5 billion KRW ($4.75 million).The second contest is arguably a trifle more equitable, paying out up to 2% for deposits and transactions of 20,000-50,000 VET.Green light for VeChain?VeChain is a product identification management solution on the blockchain – a unique ID for every product, combining blockchain and encrypted ID.Whether by divine intervention, good luck, or sheer competence, VeChain has fared remarkably well during the current market bloodbath.Their fantastic defiance has not gone unnoticed, with even CNBC going as far as to coin VET the “one survivor of this year’s cryptocurrency slaughter.”What is VeChain’s saving grace?  While there is no certainty in this speculative market, some factors seem to have cushioned VeChain from the bearish blow.There’s their ever-growing list of imposing partnerships, boasting such unimaginable heavyweights as BMW, PriceWaterHouseCoopers, and even the Government of China, all of whom appear to be chomping at the bit at the prospect of VeChain’s distributed business solutions.Thank you @BMWStartups for the clarification! The future is very bright between @vechainofficial and BMW! We are thrilled we get to show it off soon! #GoVeChain https://t.co/wtUcpxnCH7— VeChain Foundation (@vechainofficial) April 1, 2018Next comes the question of the much-trumpeted Thor re-branding. With a twin-token blockchain looming in the near-distance, VET holders will be rewarded with VeThor(VTHO) as a by-product, similar to how the GAS token works with NEO.VeChain is now called VeChain Thor, and its token will be converted from the existing VET token to VeChain Thor (VET) token. The foundation is adopting a “Proof of Authority” consensus mechanismThe Thor re-branding would undoubtedly explain the unrestrained fervor for Bithumb’s viral giveaway, with punters scrabbling to muster every VET token they can.In these tough times, green candlesticks are to be considered nothing short of a godsend. While they are to be welcomed with heavy sighs of relief, it is hard to say with conviction precisely what this particular spike means for VeChain.After all, the smart money continues to flirt with the market, time and time again proving their ability to suffocate even the most promising of projects.For more information on VeChain, including real-time price, market cap, and social media links, check out our VeChain coin profile.Posted In: VeChain, China, Korea, Altcoins, Exchanges     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

600,CryptoSlate,"CoinDash Hacker Inexplicably Returns Another 20,000 ETH Days Before Platform Launch",Sam Town,1519352580.0,"The cryptocurrency ecosystem is no stranger to hacks and scams, but rarely do we see malicious parties returning stolen capital after successful hacks. The anonymous hacker responsible for stealing more than $7 million worth of Ethereum from Israel-based ICO CoinDash has done just that, however, inexplicably returning another 20,000 ETH (currently worth $17.3 million USD) to the platform and adding to the 10,000 ETH that was returned in September 2017.CoinDash has announced the return of the funds earlier today via both Medium and an email update, stating that the return of the lost capital will not affect the CoinDash launch, which is scheduled for February 27th.20,000 ETH were sent from the Hacker address back to CoinDash, product launch stay on schedule. Our official statement can be found here: https://t.co/s9dWmWjt0G— Blox.io (@Blox_Official) February 23, 2018Alon Muroch, the CEO of CoinDash, released a public statement on the return of the lost ETH:“Similar to the hack itself, the hacker’s actions will not prevent us from the realizing our vision, CoinDash product launch will take place next week as originally intended.”CoinDash CEO Alon MurochThis is not the first time the magnanimous hacker behind the Coinbase hack has returned stolen ETH— 10,000 ETH was mysteriously returned on September 19th last year.The original CoinDash ICO was compromised in July 2017, when the hacker was able to alter the Ethereum address used to solicit funds during the CoinDash crowdsale.The return of the lost Etherum was met with incredulity by Muroch, who stated in an interview last year that he had not expected the hacker to give back any of the stolen ETH: “We have not been contacted by the hacker, or anyone related to the hacker… A hacker steals a lot of money and out of the blue returns some of it. It’s truly incredible, this industry.”The Ethereum address used to divert the funds away from the CoinDash ICO can be viewed here — the original 488 ETH captured in the hack was siphoned away to another address, from which it was subsequently distributed amongst a range of other wallets over 15 different transactions. The last transaction out of the hacker’s wallet was the unexplainable return of CoinDash’s capital, leaving just 13,000 ETH remaining.CoinDash has stated that the Israeli Counter Cyber Terrorist Unit has been notified of the return, with the hacker’s Ethereum addresses continuing to be tracked and monitored for any suspicious activity. A formal update is expected to be released by CoinDash later this week.Posted In: Israel, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "

With Revain, legitimate, genuine reviews are the name of the game—rewarding users and businesses alike for proper conduct.The platform uses IBM’s artificial intelligence to automatically screen and filter out fake and poor-quality reviews, and then safeguard them on Ethereum’s immutable blockchain (where they cannot be altered).In early iterations of Revain’s platform, reviews on Revain are limited to successfully completed ICO and crowdfunding cryptocurrency projects. There are currently twenty coins listed on their website. These are early days on the Revain roadmap, and the team plans to expand to e-commerce, booking, and gaming—reportedly “cooperating with giants of the gaming industry” in Q4 this year.According to the website, the concept of Revain can be distilled down to this:“Using blockchain technology, we managed to create an economic model, which allows common users to stay highly motivated because of our token – RVN. Using the second token – R and nonlinear conversion mechanism, Revain acquired an absolutely stable internal token. And finally, due to Ethereum platform, we were able to create a transparent system, guaranteeing immutability and incorruptibility.”What problem does it solve?More than ever, feedback has an essential role in society. Feedback shapes how businesses tailor their products and services to meet the demands of consumers, and influences the decisions the end-consumer makes.From reading up on a new cryptocurrency investment to finding the tastiest cheeseburger in town, independent and unbiased reviews help consumers make informed decisions, and businesses better service their customers.Sites like TripAdvisor and Yelp exist as standalone feedback platforms, while Amazon and eBay legitimize their products by allowing users to place feedback on their purchases. All of the above have become an essential part of how we identify quality products and services that meet our needs.But while the internet gives a voice to all, foul play and misinformation have become an accepted reality of the landscape. Competitors may falsify reviews to discredit a product, while the review platforms themselves may modify or delete feedback that doesn’t fit their agenda.Now, more than ever, there is a valid need for quality, trustworthy feedback. Trawling through the garbage of online forums just won’t cut the mustard.How will Revain help?Revain takes the possibility of bias and corruption out of the equation, with an end-to-end process designed to pick out quality feedback and then safeguard it. All incoming reviews will have to pass an initial screening test, with IBM’s Watson AI platform analyzing emotional and unconstructive language. Colorful imagery, memes and expletives will remain on subreddits or the forum of your choice.Successful reviews are then approved or rejected by the company in question—either way, comments will be visible to all. Thanks to the Ethereum blockchain and RSS smart contracts, users and companies alike can be 100% sure that the review has not been censored at any point of the process.The beauty of Revain’s platform is that it benefits individual consumers and businesses equally, while creating an incentive for honesty.Users can be rewarded with RVN tokens for submitting a review, while companies can use the token to purchase quality feedback, direct from its customer base. And at the end of the whole journey, consumers have unbridled access transparent, high-quality feedback to aid their decision-making.The token is also used to discourage foul play by any party involved. Users may be fined for breaching the platform’s regulations, and companies penalized when unfairly dismissing reviews.Who made Revain?Rinat Arslanov is an entrepreneur with 10+ years in business, venture capitalist and blockchain enthusiast.The project is the brainchild of Rinat Arslanov, a young entrepreneur that stumbled upon blockchain technology only last year. While Arnaslov and his Russian-based team are recent additions to the blockchain community, they appear highly capable judging by their progress to date.Arnaslov and his team maintain an active presence on all the usual suspects: Facebook, Medium, Reddit, Twritter Telegram, and appear to be gaining momentum across all platforms.While boasting a modest number of followers, they are producing quality content on a regular basis, timely updates, and tick all the boxes when it comes to transparency and professional expertise.Token & ICOIn order to create a more stable currency, Revain’s platform functions with two tokens: the current ‘R’ and the planned ‘RVN’, which will hit exchanges in Q3 this year. R was issued in limited supply as a tradable commodity, while RVN will be used within the Revain system itself.Three months ago, Revain was $0.17 and is now trading for $3.13, a gain of more than 1,800%.As the platform grows in size, the limited R token will increase in value. Meanwhile, RVN will remain unaffected by market volatility.Revain’s ICO was perhaps slightly underwhelming, yet many projects have gone on to succeed from humble beginnings.Revain put up 700,000,000 R tokens for its ICO in August last year, concluding the sale on the 4th of September with 263,500,000 being sold for $12,513,346.Revain is being traded on OKEX, KuCoin, HitBTC, Cryptopia and EtherDelta.Concluding ThoughtsQuality feedback is invaluable to both individuals and businesses, yet current systems have allowed the creation of what Trump might call “fake reviews.” In this day and age, finding a source of quality advice is as good (and as rare) as gold.Revain have concocted an innovative combination of AI and blockchain technology that is an innovative solution to an age-old issue.It gives users a financial incentive to contribute constructive feedback, while giving businesses a direct source of quality information to streamline their products and services to users’ needs.When Revain launches its reviews incentive system in Q3 this year, will consumers choose to continue trawling through fake reviews, or to be paid for their feedback? To the layman, it seems like a no-brainer.For more information on Revain including price, market cap, technical information and social media links, check out our Revain coin profile or watch the short video below:Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
602,CryptoSlate,A Guide to Data Storage Coins,Matt Breen,1518660180.0,"Cloud storage is nothing new. For years now, it’s been possible for consumers to forego the traditional local storage options afforded by external hard drives, and to instead subscribe to a third-party service that allows them to upload and download their files to remote servers run by companies such as Google, Apple, Dropbox and Amazon, to name a few.The remote option offers certain advantages over physical storage – accessibility from multiple devices and no reliance on hardware (which can be destroyed or stolen). Typically, the models are also a lot more flexible – an individual can simply pay for more storage if required, as opposed to shelling out for a multi-terabyte device from the get go. However, this does come at the cost of trusting a third party with your potentially sensitive data.In the age of blockchain revolution, where even banana plantations have their own token, there was undoubtedly going to be some form of disruption to the data storage industry.A number of projects have endeavoured to harness the power of decentralisation to rival the services provided by dedicated servers, creating a market for people to ‘rent out’ the unused space on their devices (think Golem, but for storage). Below are some of the most popular.Storj“Storj is a protocol that creates a distributed network for the formation and execution of storage contracts between peers. The Storj protocol enables peers on the network to negotiate contracts, transfer data, verify the integrity and availability of remote data, retrieve data, and pay other nodes.”Storj is an open-source distributed cloud storage platform based on blockchain technology where anyone can sell their extra hard drive space.Storj (pronounced ‘storage’) is a decentralised and censor-proof storage platform. From a security standpoint, it blows traditional cloud storage out of the water – when a user wishes to upload a file, it is encrypted client-side, before being split into pieces (a process referred to as ‘sharding’).The shards are distributed across the network’s nodes and into the available storage offered by ‘farmers’ (those renting their drives).The system relies on a form of proof known as ‘proof-of-retrievability’ for auditing purposes – using cryptographic proofs (I won’t elaborate on these too much, but this paper and the whitepaper explain the idea in technical terms), the farmers can prove to the user that their shards haven’t been tampered with, and are indeed being stored.Storj has built up an impressive user base since its creation (originally issuing a Counterparty token under the name SCJX, it has since migrated to the ERC-20-based STORJ). At the time of its Town Hall in late November 2017, it boasted 13 petabytes of data stored by 35,000 farmers. The architecture of the network has certainly facilitated a distributed storage solution, but calling the platform truly decentralised is a point of contention amongst many.The bridges connecting the various nodes occasionally face downtime, which prevents transfer of data between participants (it’s worth noting that this affects only the service, and not the network itself). Payouts to farmers are not automated via any smart-contract magic, but are calculated by the team on a monthly basis using an algorithm.Storj is better thought of as a business akin to Uber or AirBnb – instead of Storj Labs owning data centres, it enables users to monetise an otherwise unused resource, and is able to undercut the traditional market for data storage (it is cheaper than both Amazon and Microsoft’s offerings).Sia“Sia combines a peer-to-peer network with blockchain technology to create the world’s first decentralized storage platform.”Sia, launched in 2015 by Nebulous, Inc., is a blockchain storage solution which, on the surface, is similar to Storj. Under the hood, however, the two have some major differences.Sia operates on its own blockchain, and is touted in the whitepaper as being a ‘Bitcoin derivative’. There is no cap on the maximum amount of Siacoins – users can mine these indefinitely (although the block rewards do decrease over time). In this regard, Sia is perhaps more decentralised than its competitors.The lack of centralisation has given rise to a storage market, where hosts can compete to offer lower pricing. The protocol makes extensive use of smart contracts to govern interactions between nodes. Payment-wise, the Sia model is not dissimilar to the Lightning Network – the renter places funds in what is called an ‘incremental contract’ (this is really just a payment channel), with two outputs: the renter and the host.Sia is the first decentralized storage platform secured by blockchain technology.Initially, the contract will stipulate that the funds are to be returned to the renter. However, as uploads and downloads take place, it can be updated to reflect how much should be paid out to the host if they store the files as expected. In shifting the settlements off-chain, Sia reduces blockchain bloat to achieve better scalability.Like Storj, Sia makes use of erasure coding to mitigate the risk of nodes going offline or data disappearing.The contracts between host and renter also require periodic proof on the former’s behalf that they are storing the files, to be completed within a set timeframe. If they fail to provide this, they risk penalties that endanger their funds.Sia’s network stats can be viewed here. It should be noted that its architecture makes it slower than Storj, and requires that users deposit collateral if operating as hosts.Filecoin“The Filecoin network achieves staggering economies of scale by allowing anyone worldwide to participate as storage providers. It also makes storage resemble a commodity or utility by decoupling hard-drive space from additional services.”The team behind Filecoin is none other than Protocol Labs, creators of IPFS. Unlike the other two projects, Filecoin is not operational as of yet, although its ERC-20 token has already been distributed in ICO (the allocation of tokens has seen some significant criticism).The Filecoin network achieves staggering economies of scale by allowing anyone worldwide to participate as storage providers.Filecoin is closer in design to Sia than Storj, in that contracts are stored on the blockchain. Filecoin’s market is set to automatically pair up a renter with a host.There is a shift away from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Replication, where hosts are able to demonstrate to a renter that they have cloned the uploaded files to physical storage (the whitepaper claims this will reduce the ease of performing Sybil attacks), and Proof-of-Spacetime, to verify that the host is storing the data. Blocks are mined in such a way that incentivises miners to amass as much storage as possible (which grants them more mining power).It is hard to comment on the efficiency of the Filecoin ecosystem at present, as there is little more than the whitepaper to go on.ConclusionThe three projects discussed are by no means the only ones being developed (MaidSafe’s vision extends beyond simple storage, and is also worth taking a look at).With data storage being such a huge industry, there’s plenty of space for multiple teams to work on different models that suit different users’ needs (allowing them to weigh up factors such as decentralisation/speed/price).Data storage is a market ripe for disruption. With vapourware polluting most other areas in the cryptospace, it is refreshing to see two already-deployed projects which have undercut traditional cloud storage by relying on user resources, with more to follow.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
603,CryptoSlate,What is U.CASH and Why Did It Surge Thousands of Percent In Days?,Sam Town,1518584760.0,"Rising star U.CASH has recently made an explosive entrance into the cryptocurrency market, recording gains of thousands of percent just days from launch. U.CASH has now achieved a market cap of over $500 million and has settled into a strong position in the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap, promising financial freedom for the unbanked.With the launch of the U.CASH platform we introduce the world’s first Initial Bounty Offering (IBO).What exactly is U.CASH, though, and what does it do? In this introduction to U.CASH we’ll explore the goals, history, team, and function of U.CASH and cut through the hype around 2018’s most incendiary new initial coin offering in an attempt to decipher the cause of its perplexingly meteoric rise to the upper echelons of the market cap ranks.What is U.CASH?The U.CASH project began life as “SecuraCoin”, a Canadian startup focused on integrating digital currency payment methods and trading with brick-and-mortar retail businesses. The U.CASH project now aims to deliver financial freedom for the unbanked by allowing retailers to seamlessly exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency through a planned “retail converter network”.Instead of running a traditional initial coin offering, U.CASH launched with a unique “IBO”, or Initial Bounty Offering , which distributed a large part of the 8 billion or so tokens generated in the event to individuals that participated in the massive U.CASH bounty scheme. Tokens are now available in a range of trading pairs on the BTC-Alpha exchange only.While the core axiom of U.CASH may involve blurring the lines between digital and fiat currencies via a network of retail operators, the planned services outlined by the U.CASH project are extremely broad. U.CASH claims that users will be able to pay bills via dedicated smartphone apps, link prepaid debit cards to pay for goods and services with cryptocurrency directly, or even notarize documents.While the U.CASH platform may promise many enticing features, it can be difficult to pin down exactly what U.CASH wants to deliver, how it plans on doing so, and technical specifics of how the project operates.While U.CASH does deliver a comprehensive FAQ, it appears to be designed with blockchain beginners in mind, focusing more on broad explanations of “what is Bitcoin” as opposed to technical information.Ageesen Sri is the founder of U.CASHThe U.CASH team is driven by founder Ageesen Sri, but the core project from which U.CASH emerged was founded by U.CASH operating officer Sina Kachooie.The U.CASH team is massive, but there aren’t any names amongst the lineup that stand out— even amongst U.CASH’s advisors and ambassadors.There is a significant amount of concern in the U.CASH investor community that the swift rise in value of the token could be a “pump and dump”, or even a scam — whether or not U.CASH is legitimate remains to be seen, but the U.CASH reddit community is currently experiencing issues in receiving U.CASH tokens from U.CASH at the time of this report.How U.CASH WorksThe concerns around the legitimacy of the U.CASH ICO could potentially stem from the complex nature of the platform combined with the highly accessible nature of the U.CASH marketing materials. On the surface. U.CASH appears to be seamless, smooth, and intuitive.According to to the U.CASH website, U.CASH will operate as a service for everyday users and as a platform for retail operators, who are referred to as “converters”. Users will be provided with access to the platform via a smartphone app that allows them to access cash via the U.CASH converter network, access a virtual credit card, and access other cryptocurrency functionality such as peer-to-peer payments and secure value storage.The robust U.CASH feature setConverters are able to use the U.CASH platform to convert cash to digital currencies via their retail locations, provide peer-to-peer loans, and verify users in accordance with KYC and AML requirements in person.Further QuestionsThe services outlined above are but a fraction of the features promised by the U.CASH platform, which raises a serious question — how does U.CASH plan to deliver on this vast, rich, feature set?It’s difficult to pin down a clear answer from the U.CASH website. In one section of the U.CASH FAQ U.CASH claims that the platform is “blockchain agnostic”, but this isn’t necessarily true. U.CASH tokens are ERC-20 standard tokens issued on top of the Ethereum blockchain.U.CASH explains on their token page that U.CASH capabilities will be delivered on any blockchain that is “integrated” into U.CASH. This integration method essentially involved “freezing” tokens on one blockchain and converting it at a 1:1 rate to a token on another blockchain through a process called “pegging.”This raises a number of serious questions regarding how U.CASH plans to manage token volatility and arbitrage between the blockchains it pegs tokens on, how liquidity is managed, and how U.CASH plans to secure funds that are frozen while pegged to ensure they can’t be active on both chains at the same time — none of which are answered anywhere on the U.CASH platform.Is U.CASH Legitimate?Ultimately, there are a number of issues that raise red flags regarding the U.CASH platform. Apart from the obvious technical issues that aren’t addressed in any of the information provided by the platform, the U.CASH white paper appears to have disappeared from the internet and is only available via an archive site.There are a number of typos in the U.CASH FAQ section, which is unbecoming of a platform that has risen so high in the market cap ranks, and the level of criticism leveled against U.CASH in the U.CASH subreddit is cause for concern.The biggest issue with the U.CASH platform, however, is that it’s antithetical to the core precepts of blockchain technology itself. Instead of creating a decentralized, democratic system, U.CASH appears to want to establish itself as “trusted third party” arbiter that delivers swift conversion from fiat to crypto— but at what cost?U.CASH may deliver on the promises it makes in it’s “IBO” and succeed in generating a network of retail “converter” locations, but before doing so will need to provide clear and concise answers to the questions that are currently degrading its credibility.

604,CryptoSlate,Guide to the Zclassic / Bitcoin Private Fork,Austin Tuwiner,1518335640.0,"In 2017, we saw several Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond. In 2018, there are over 10 more on the way such as Bitcoin God, Bitcoin Private and Bitcoin Monkey. I am kidding about Bitcoin Monkey, but the amount of Bitcoin forks that are on the way are comical. For a more complete list including Bitcoin Ore and Bitcoin Pizza… check out this page on upcoming Bitcoin forks.A fork in cryptocurrency occurs when the source code of a project is changed and a majority of the users can not agree on the change. If I added a line of code to Bitcoin that gave half of every block reward to me, most people would not agree with that.If I wanted to proceed, even though the majority doesn’t agree, I could then fork the project creating my version (Bitcoin Monkey) that co exists with the original Bitcoin. I would use Bitcoin’s existing history which is basically a snapshot of where all the coins reside at a given time, as well as past transactions.Why Would Someone Want to Fork Bitcoin?One incentive of forking from Bitcoin, is that it brings a lot of attention, and a massively increased market capitalization of the coin.Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the amount of coins in circulation by the last price a coin was sold for. When a coin forks, users may decide to not claim the fork, for whatever the reason (usually privacy).This creates a limited supply of the coin compared to its circulating supply. This makes the coin have lower supply than it appears to, which creates a “fake” market cap.Zclassic is a fork of Zcash but the difference is that all mining rewards in Zclassic go directly to the miners.This is clearly shown in the market cap rankings, as there are technically 6 versions of Bitcoin in the top 300. Bitcoin, BCash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Dark and Zclassic (futures market in a way for Bitcoin Private).Currently, Zclassic has 3.18 million coins. When the fork happens, Bitcoins current supply of 16.8 million will be added to Zclassics creating a circulating supply of ~20 million Bitcoin Private.What is Zclassic?To explain this, we are going to go all the way back to 2016 when Zcash split from Bitcoin. Zcash planned to add way more privacy than the current version of Bitcoin.There were two main additions to the code, that many people had an issue with. The first addition, is a founders reward, which means that 20% of all the newly issued coins for the first four years, are given to Zcash investors and developers. They claim that this is a way for the coin developers to be rewarded for their hard work, and also a way to ensure they have the coins future success in mind.The creator of Litecoin, Charlie Lee recently took a different route, and publicly announced that he sold all of his Litecoin, to remain impartial to the project.The second addition was a “slow start” block reward. This reduces the block rewards initially, and slowly ramps up to be in line with Bitcoins block rewards. This occured for the first 20,000 blocks, which was around 34 days.Many people saw this unfair, as the price of Zcash skyrocketed in those first days. At one point Zcash was selling for 100 BTC each. To put that into perspective, today they are worth .041 BTC each.Later in October 2016. Zclassic forked from Zcash, with two key changes.No Founders RewardNo Slow StartMany view Zclassic to be a much more fair alternative to Zcash, while keeping the strengths of Bitcoin and Zcash intact.In early December 2017, developer Rhett Creighton announced that he would be teaming up with the old Zclassic co-owner Joshua/@movrcx and together they will be reviving the once abandoned Zclassic project. This excited many people, and brought a lot of attention back to the project.A week or so later, Rhett started announcing plans to fork Zclassic, into something called Bitcoin Private. There are so many forks in Zcashs history that a family of 3 could eat with them.Anyone who owns Zclassic, will receive one Bitcoin Private and anyone who owns Bitcoin, will have a 1:1 ratio of Bitcoin to Bitcoin Private airdropped to their address.  Read how to claim Bitcoin forks, and Bitcoin private here.The official snapshot date for the Zclassic/Bitcoin Private fork is said to be on February 28, 2018.If your goal is to own Bitcoin Private, your best bet is to obtain Zclassic, as they are currently going for around $100 while Bitcoin’s are selling for around $8,000.No exchange has commented on supporting the fork/airdrop yet, so it is best to keep your Zclassic on an official wallet. I would expect Bittrex to, as it is currently listed on there, and they supported the NXT/IGNIS airdrop.How Do I Buy Zclassic?Zclassic is pretty limited on the exchanges it can be bought on. There are only 3, Bittrex, Cryptopia, and Coinexchange. Out of all of the 3, I trust Bittrex the most, but they currently have their sign ups down. I recommend Cryptopia if you do not have access to Bittrex.You can slo try signing up for Bittrex’s waitlist, but I am unsure when the signups will be processed.For those interested in a new account on Bittrex, please use this waitlist form. https://t.co/hdH2ruviPU— Bittrex (@BittrexExchange) January 29, 2018I do not like keeping my cryptocurrency on exchanges, so it is important to keep them on a secure wallet. Learn about Zclassic wallets in the section below!Zclassic / Bitcoin Private WalletsThe official Zclassic wallet is available for download on the projects website.The Mac and web wallets are currently being updated, so stay tuned for those. It is not currently supported on the Ledger Nano S, which in my opinion is the best way to store any cryptocurrency. Past Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Cash have been supported by the Ledger Nano S, so in the event that Bitcoin Private gets as big as those, it will almost certainly be added.What’s next for Zclassic and Bitcoin Private?One of the lead developers on Zclassic, Rhett Creighton has said that after the fork, he will focus his efforts on Bitcoin Private, not Zclassic. If history repeats itself, similar to the NXT airdrop situation, the price of Zclassic will fall the second the snapshot happens, as the current price will not reflect the cost of 1 Zclassic and 1 BCP, it will just reflect 1 Zclassic, which had a price of around $1.80, even when there was no developers working on it.If you want to keep track of the Bitcoin Private fork situation, I would recommend following their reddit and twitter.

605,CryptoSlate,Monero – Privacy and Anonymity on the Blockchain,Ali Raza,1518260880.0,"Fittingly, the exact origin story behind Monero is still somewhat mysterious. Like digital cash, it’s untraceable as it changes hands.What is Monero?The concept behind Monero was first published by Nicolas van Saberhagen. This name was later proven to be a pseudonym and can refer to either an individual creator or developing team.Monero was created to enhance the user’s anonymity, an issue that was increasingly experienced in the Bitcoin community.While Nicolas van Saberhagen came up with the idea behind the cryptocurrency, it was coded by a user simply known by their online pseudonym “thankful_for_today”.Monero was initially called Bitmonero, taking the “monero” part from Esperanto, where the term means coin. However, after a hard fork in 2014, the cryptocurrency evolved into the Monero that we know today.While users technically enjoy a degree of anonymity on the Bitcoin network, the network still allows transactions to be traced back to the accounts from which they originated. In addition, users on the bitcoin network can see each other’s total bitcoin holdings available in their accounts.While it’s relatively easy for bitcoin users to keep their real-life identities hidden on the Bitcoin network, it becomes difficult to do so once you engage in any Bitcoin deals that require you to use your name.After attaching your name to a deal, it becomes easy for other users to trace transactions back to you. While the regular user would not be too alarmed by this, those users who need bitcoin for not-so-legal activities obviously consider this a major issue.To address this, Monero uses several techniques to ensure anonymity on its network. All users are issued with “stealth addresses”. These unique addresses are encrypted which prevents any transactions from being traced back to its account of origin.In addition, the Monero network lumps hundreds of transactions together, meaning that it’s incredibly difficult for a curious user to single anyone transaction. The exact amount in every transaction is also not displayed, which makes any tracking virtually impossible.Monero is an open-source cryptocurrency that focuses on privacy, decentralization and scalability.Emergent Privacy ProblemsRecently, it was discovered that hackers have taken to targeting YouTube ads in order to distribute cryptocurrency mining malware to audiences all over the world. Attacks of this nature often referred to as “cryptojacking,” have become more popular and frequent ever since the price increase of most major cryptocurrencies over the last few months.Cryptojacking involves the distribution of malicious code that allows the hacker to hijack the victim’s computer processing units (CPUs) to covertly mine cryptocurrency to the benefit of the responsible hacker.While the increasing frequency of the attacks is unsurprising, the surprising factor is the fact that all these attacks use Monero as their mining cryptocurrency of choice.Monero was established in 2014 and was created to allow its users’ maximum anonymity. However, a 2017 report from Wired notes that this enhanced anonymity has made Monero a popular currency on the Dark Web.The Dark Web is perhaps a somewhat notorious online black market where users frequently use cryptocurrencies to purchase questionable and illegal goods such as stolen credit card information, weaponry, and illegal substances.Ever since the Wired initial report, however, Monero has become more prominent in mainstream culture. At the time of writing, Monero is ranked as the world’s 13th largest cryptocurrency, in terms of market capitalization.Over the past month, Monero reached a high of $420. It is currently trading at a 40% discount of $248.According to the cryptocurrency coin rankings, Monero is currently priced at $248 per coin. Experts also predict future great expectations for the cryptocurrency and believe that Monero could become even more prominent and valuable in 2018.However, what exactly is Monero, how can you invest in it, and what can be expected from this cryptocurrency in the future?What’s next for Monero?Project Coral Reef is an initiative created by Naveen Jain and Riccardo Spagni to elevate the awareness and viability of using Monero in everyday consumer transactions.Monero offers an alternative to the original p2p coin model. Its privacy capabilities allow the consumer/investor/holder certain privileges that other coins just can’t provide.In addition, the Bitcoin network has become increasingly impractical in its transaction times and fees as the network has become too popular. Even if the Bitcoin network could solve its structural problems, its issues of privacy remain.For example, even if you could pay your bills using Bitcoin, your creditors could still see how much money you actually have available in your account. Monero offers its users much more privacy in this respect in addition to a more practical network.Monero might also be pushed to new heights as influential figures join its developing team. Charlie Lee, who became famous as Litecoin’s creator and founder, tweeted that he would like to collaborate with Monero so that the two cryptocurrencies could be integrated seamlessly.Although @fluffypony was kidding here, I think it would be good for Litecoin and Monero (2 of the top non-scam coins 😄) to work together. A while back, I proposed to him that we work on making it easy for people to do on-chain atomic swaps of LTC and XMR in a decentralized way. https://t.co/idDn7Dmzf7— Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) January 27, 2018However, the cryptocurrency industry is becoming increasingly competitive and Monero has a growing list of worthy competitors that are likely to give it a run for its digital money.For example, both Dash and ZCash offer similar privacy protocols and are currently worth more than Monero at $685 and $385, respectively.How to Buy MoneroWhile Monero is not currently available on Coinbase, the interested investor has plenty of other options.Popular cryptocurrency exchange platforms such as Bitfinex and Kraken allow you to buy Monero using fiat currency, while over-the-counterPosted In: Monero, Adoption, Altcoins, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
606,CryptoSlate,Garlicoin – Serious Project or Speculative Memecoin?,Bill DeLisle,1518154500.0,"In many ways, Reddit is a microcosm of the entire internet. Each month more than 500 million visitors access the site to participate in its famed celebrity Ask Me Anything events, to share cat photos, and to create memes.The site is divided into “subreddits” where users can engage a niche community in nearly any topic imaginable. It’s a uniquely user-centered platform because every user can “up vote” or “down vote” content that they like or dislike. The most “up voted” content rises to the top of the feeds so that Reddit sometimes feels like a democratized popularity contest.This esoteric process is evidently capable of far more than just promoting great memes. Late last year, Reddit user Digitized Orange used it to jump-start a new cryptocurrency, Garlicoin.Introducing GarlicoinGarlicoin is the new, friendly, decentralized cryptocurrency that you’ve never heard of.On December 25, 2017, Digitized Orange posted on Reddit, “If this post gets 30,000 up votes, I will make a garlicoin cryptocurrency called garlicoin.” The post received more than 45 thousand up votes, and Garlicoin was born.Garlicoin is a unique cryptocurrency because of its care-free approach to cryptocurrencies and its pursuit of improving some of the most frustrating problems related to cryptocurrencies.Of course, its name, an unsophisticated combination of “garlic” and “coin,” is an accurate indicator of the platforms humorous underpinnings.Although their introductory document claims, “This is the coin you never thought you needed, and you probably don’t,” Garlic and its GRLC token have several compelling features.Under the HoodAs their website boasts, Garlicoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency with no new technology. Of course, as with most things, Garlicoin is being facetious.Garlicoin is a branch of Litecoin.It’s a branch of the Litecoin codebase, a popular digital currency with a $8.3 billion market cap. As a result, it boasts cheap, fast transactions. Moreover, only 69 million Garlicoin will ever be available.Impressively, according to their documentation, the Garlicoin blockchain is ASIC resistant, and the platform can produce 40 second block times.They use an open mining, Proof of Work protocol that allows anyone with a GPU to participate in the mining process.Recent Price MovementOn January 23, Garlicoin released its Airdroped GRLC tokens. When it first hit crypto markets, Garlicoin traded around $0.75. The token drew significant interest, and, within a day, it more than quadrupled in price and almost hit $4.However, Garlicoin has steadily declined since its first day. It’s currently trading around $0.25, and it has a market cap of $535,000.Where to BuyCurrently, there are two ways to attain Garlicoin. GRLC tokens can be purchased directly from their owners. Reddit users have developed a Garlic Market where users can buy and sell the coins.Investors can also purchase GRLC tokens through a number of smaller crypto exchanges, including as TradeSatoshi, CoinFalcon, and NaneX.Target AudienceGarlicoin’s tone and approach make them a controversial cryptocurrency for many investors. After all, the GRLC token is unlikely to find enterprise adoption or even adoption as a digital expression of fiat currency any time soon. In other words, for now, what you see is what you get.Dogecoin is an open source peer-to-peer digital currency, favored by Shiba Inus worldwide.Even so, as currencies like Dogecoin can attest, even farcical cryptocurrencies can find success, and that’s the audience that Garlicoin is looking to attract.Because there is an extremely low point of entry, Garlicoin is available to anyone, and its low cost makes it a compelling option for experienced crypto traders or even first-time investors.Ultimately, Garlicoin is creating an unintimidating platform that is perfect for the newly initiated crypto investors to begin exploring the crypto ecosystem.A Notable ControversyOn February 5th, Garlicoin released a statement on Medium about online rumblings of a missing 40,000 GRLC and a rumor that they had an ASIC in their blockchain.At some point in the pre-launch phase, Garlicoin lost control of 40,000 coins that should have been distributed during the Airdrop event. Although they initially considered a hard fork to reclaim the money, community members reject this solution, and Garlicoin has abandoned this as a reasonable solution to the theft.In their official statement, Garlicoin wrote,“we were naïve and didn’t consider the possibility of members of our dev team being malicious. For that, we can only apologise, and do everything we can to fix our mistake.”Meanwhile, Garlicoin continues their efforts to trace and locate the missing coins.In addition, the Garlic development team found the rumors that there was an ASIC on their network to be unfounded. Even so, they committed to continuing the search to ensure that this threat is not compromising their network. At least they are poking fun about it on Reddit.When a few asic miners try to steal all of your tasty meme money.. https://t.co/8JKPrZcTNC #garlicoin $GRLC pic.twitter.com/lfXNLuxsXt— Garlicoin (@Garliccoin) February 8, 2018CommunityThe Garlicoin Reddit is an impressive community boasting over 140,000 users.As you might expect from its origin story, Garlicoin boasts a robust Reddit community of more than 130,000 members.Their Twitter account, which has been live for less than a month, has just over 1,000 followers, and their Facebook page has only 200 likes.Closing ThoughtsMany people feel conflicted about projects like Garlicoin because they are neither overtly false nor entirely serious. In many ways, Garlicoin seems to be shirking many of the pretentious advertising gimmicks that many cryptocurrencies utilize.For instance, when Garlicoin writes that it is the “new technology that will get you through the darkest times in your life,” users can appreciate the joke and the tacit acknowledgment that cryptocurrencies cannot solve all of our problems, and they shouldn’t pretend that they can.However, Garlicoin does take their technology and their community seriously. When controversy erupted, they quickly addressed their community and brought clarity to the situation. Moreover, the success of Dogecoin indicates that Garlicoin just may have a place in the cryptocurrency marketplace.Most importantly, since Garlicoin is committed to addressing scaling concerns, confidential transactions, and strong blockchain storage, the platform’s future could be very positive.In comments to their users, Garlicoin notes,“We intend this coin to be not only a fun and friendly introduction to cryptocurrency, but also a worthwhile coin in its own right.”Although it doesn’t take itself too seriously, investors can, and that will determine its success going forward. For more information about Garlicoin including it’s price, market cap, technical information and links to its community, see our Garlicoin coin profile.In closing, we’ll leave you with this accurate infographic comparing Garlic to Bitcoin from reddit user u/Vilsol.

607,CryptoSlate,What is the Deal with ChatCoin?,,1517532180.0,"The supersonic boom of a new coin hitting exchanges is nothing new, yet it prompts the question: are people buying into something they understand, or merely jumping on any old coin when the timing’s right? ChatCoin is another new player on the scene experiencing a price eruption after being listed on Binance.After slumbering around the $0.30 mark since mid January, ChatCoin rocketed upwards after its Binance listing on the 31st of Janaury; nearly doubling in value in less than 2 hours. Over the past month, ChatCoin’s daily volume has ranged anywhere from $5 million to $98 million per day.“ChatCoin Up 500% From ICO Price” quickly barreled its way across the cryptocurrency community, but unsurprisingly the mania was short-lived, with prices quickly correcting back down to $0.30.While a Binance listing is a promising start for any coin, there are a number of question marks floating around this mysterious newcomer.What is ChatCoin?ChatCoin is a token on the QTUM blockchain for BeeChat.ChatCoin is the native token of BeeChat, an Instant Messenger dApp based on QTUM’s blockchain. BeeChat sets out to blur the line between human interaction and transaction with its light wallet extension.While cryptocurrencies are still obscure, novel, or completely unknown to the vast majority of the earth’s population, developers are constantly looking for environments where they can be used organically.The complexity of wallets, private keys, and crypto-jargon is intimidating at best, and the market is crying out for an accessible usage case for cryptocurrency. OpenChat see Instant Messenger (IM) as the perfect vessel.BeeChat is available on iOS and Android.The reach of IM applications is beyond prolific, with the likes of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Telegram having become a vital part of everyday life. In spite of their global prowess, none have attempted to create a messenger service with an integrated payment system.Enter: ChatCoin. If BeeChat were to rise to the level of the big boys in IM, the OpenChat team imagine BeeChat as a one-stop shop for advertising, mobile games, e-commerce and nearly any product or service imaginable with CHAT as a quick, easy, and painless way to transact.ChatCoin DistributionChatCoin’s tokens were sold at ICO for $0.082, distributing 400,000,000 CHAT of a total supply of 1,000,000,000. Bizarrely, there is almost no evidence listed as to the details of the ICO; from where and how these tokens were distributed is a mystery.Yet, the details of the ICO are but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to questions surrounding this project.CHAT is available on a number of exchanges, with more than half the coin’s circulation being traded on Binance.ChatCoin Potential CustomersThe vision of CHAT is grand to say the least; being used as a free-flowing digital currency used for peer-to-peer transactions in nearly any scenario imaginable.Ranging from global remittances to purchasing music online, each user will have a virtual ‘Bee Wallet’ attached to the application to freely transact.Aside from P2P transactions, OpenChat’s application network plan to utilize ChatCoin. Users can purchase dApps built on the network using CHAT, sending their funds directly to the developers without any cut from a middleman.While BeeChat seems to be functioning simply as another novel app on the Play Store, OpenChat has its target firmly set on “emerging markets”- namely the Middle East, South Asia, and Central and South America.OpenChat imagines a digitized future where the entire structure of society operates using digital assets; which they see as an untapped market especially in developing countries.ChatCoin TeamThe vision of ChatCoin is bold as anything, but the devil is in the details, as they say. For a project of this scale to take flight, we should know if we have a seasoned pilot in the cockpit, or a baggage handler that’s got their hands on a pilot’s uniform.The coin is a product of the faceless OpenChat group, an open-source organization reportedly founded by a group of ex-Googlers. While they claim to have been core members of Google and Huawei, the team’s transparency certainly leave a lot to the imagination.With a series of cartoon avatars, no surnames, and pseudonyms used, the credibility of their is questionable. Judging by the option for a Chinese version of the OpenChat site, we can assume this is a China-based team.The OpenChat white paper and site are riddled with errors, leaving readers wondering whether the entire project was plugged into Google Translate before publishing. While the team may be non-native speakers of English, this is another potential red flag for the capability and legitimacy of the project.Community & PartnershipsWhile projects of this nature seem to be growing amongst emerging cryptocurrency projects, what every successful coin shares is an established community.ChatCoin is lacking in this department, having virtually no online presence whatsoever. Not only do all the classic channels lack an official account (Reddit, Facebook, Telegram), there are virtually no advocates. In addition, OpenChat has no listed partnerships.Having created their Twitter account post-ICO on the 31st of January, the account has a grand total of 56 followers, with a brief list of Tweets such as “New Partnership 17 Feb. Company: WhatsApp App.” The fact that WhatsApp is a direct competitor to BeeChat, and with no mention of this partnership from WhatsApp whatsoever further calls is confusing and suspicious.Due to the lack of a team and social presence, the only comments online seem to be questioning the legitimacy of the project.ConclusionThe vision of a crypto-capable IM is valid, but perhaps a little bold, given that the transparency of this project casts titanic doubts over both its credibility and ability to deliver on its promises.Even if BeeChat were to reach billions of users, who would entrust their money to an anonymous team with no proven track record? This scale of operation would demand next-level security and performance, and there is no evidence the OpenChat team can deliver on either.A more likely outcome is that BeeChat gains a little momentum while the ability to transfer funds via messenger remains a novelty. While this may be another misunderstood project such as TRON, it will be held back until OpenChat forms notable partnerships, develops an active online presence and erases all question marks floating above the pseudo-anonymous team.Posted In: China, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
608,CryptoSlate,"World’s First Child Chain, Ignis, Now Listed on Bittrex",Bill DeLisle,1517292600.0,"While crypto markets were broadly experiencing a pullback on the heels of the news that crypto exchange Bitfinex was served a subpoena, Ignis was finally listed on Bittrex.The first child chain of Ardor will be the Ignis child chain. IGNIS tokens will be used for its operation.Ignis (IGNIS) started the day trading at less than $0.50, but it rose to almost $0.70 after Bittrex announced it was finally ready to begin trading.Its price tapered off some throughout the middle of the day and now it’s trading for $0.53 and it’s currently #58 on the coin rankings with a market cap of $416 million.Ignis is the first child chain on the Ardor network, which is a blockchain-as-a-service platform developed by Jelurida.A Different Type of BlockchainThis notion of a “child chain,” is considered a next-generation blockchain technology in which smaller blockchains are simultaneously independent in their features while continuing to exist on and imbuing the qualities of a larger, parent, blockchain.The concept of child chains is expected to help bigger blockchains with scalability issues, which is one of the most pressing problems for blockchains that are now swarming with new developers, users, and use-cases. As blockchain platforms like Ethereum endure scalability problems, Ardor and Ignis represent a compelling possible solution to these issues.In general, Ignis is considered a test coin for this blockchain model, so its release on a major crypto exchange is a significant milestone that the Ardor-faithful have been waiting on since it was announced in late December.Now Trading on BittrexBittrex is one of the most prominent and highest-volume crypto exchanges. It gives crypto investors access to hundreds of digital currencies, and it completes more than $650 million in transactions each day.The Ardor community has been waiting for the Bittrex airdrop for nearly a month. Jelurida announced plans to airdrop IGNIS token to Nxt holders on back in October, and Bittrex announced in December it would honor the airdrop several weeks later. so  Presumably, Ignis’ price increase is, at least in part, attributed to Bittrex users finally gaining access to the digital currency.Interestingly, there aren’t a lot of details about Ardor’s plan for Ignis, so it’s unclear how the digital currency will function in the future. Even so, early investors are excited about its presence on a mainstream crypto exchange, and they voiced their excitement by sending its price up on a day when prices were almost exclusively down.If you’re interested in learning more about Ignis, Ardor and Nxt, check out our article on the birth of child-chains.Posted In: Bittrex, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
609,CryptoSlate,How Streamr is Building a Data Marketplace for Unstoppable Apps [INTERVIEW],Matt Breen,1517102880.0,"It seems, perhaps as a result of the growth of the social media and advertising industries, that data is an increasingly valuable resource. In the same vein as projects like Brave with the Basic Attention Token, Streamr aims to return control back to its users, by allowing them to sell it however they see fit. CryptoSlate spoke with Henri Pihkala, the founder and CEO of Streamr, to better understand the network he hopes to build.Matt Breen: How would you sell someone on the platform?Henri Pihkala is the CEO and Founder of Streamr, a decentralized data marketplace.Henry Pihkala: You, your phone, your car, your home, the apps you use, the company you run, the city you live in – everything around you is constantly producing streams of real-time data. How much revenue are you earning from that data? Zero, you say? We want that changed.A decentralised marketplace and a scalable messaging network enable people, organisations, and machines to easily trade data – whether it’s raw data from sensors and apps, or the output of a value-adding algorithm. Traditionally, companies keep data in silos because it’s easier and less risky than sharing it. They struggle to apply the latest analytics to squeeze out the last drop of value internally, overlooking the potential external customer base as well as the wisdom of crowds.Even if companies tried to monetise the data, there are significant overheads: setting up APIs, tricky handling of credit card details, and attracting customers to their special little silo. Streamr aims to be the Ebay of data streams: an access point for all the real-time data in the world.MB: Let’s pretend that IOTA actually works as intended. How is Streamr superior?HP: Perhaps I’ll start with the similarities, since the list is shorter: both networks form a DAG topology of sorts, and both are pitching and building a data marketplace. The strategic approaches are rather different, however:IOTA aims to do micropayments, while Streamr does massively scalable low latency publish-and-subscribe messaging and NO payments. Instead, we use an accompanying blockchain for payments, identity, and a few other things in order to avoid reinventing the wheel. Consider wallets, for example. Streamr will work with any Ethereum wallet in the world. That’s a nice perk.IOTA aims to build a self-sufficient system, while Streamr plays ball with others. We aim to work in tandem with current and future smart contract ecosystems – first Ethereum, but later perhaps NEO, RSK, even Hyperledger, or whatever becomes popular down the road. Some layers of the Streamr system could even interact with IOTA!IOTA is focused on being useful for the emerging machine-to-machine (m2m) economy of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), data integrity and micro payments.We love what the IOTA guys are trying to do, and neither approach is clearly superior. If the underlying idea of tokenising data takes off, the market will be huge enough to fit five IOTAs and five Streamrs. It’s not a winner-takes-all market, because there are a multitude of blockchain ecosystems to server, various data niches, and different technical requirements for different use cases.The openness of decentralised ecosystems promotes interoperability, and for data producers the overhead for selling their data on multiple marketplaces is extremely low. They will want all the channels they can get. In addition to the “official” marketplaces, there will probably even be a multitude of niche marketplaces that others build on top of both Streamr and IOTA. In a decentralised network, anyone can set up a marketplace.MB: What sort of use cases would you like to see?HP: Personally I’m quite interested in data refinement chains: One participant makes available, say, social media data about a major S&P 500 company. Another participant buys that data, applies their sentiment analysis algorithm, and sells the output as another streamed product. Yet another participant buys that data, combines it with stock market data for that company and sells trading signals. Traders buy a variety of signals and use them as inputs for their trading algorithms. This kind of freely evolving economies of data can lead to significant sophistication of data because it taps into the intelligence of the crowd.I would also like to see the use of personal real-time data evolve. For example, currently large companies such as Google and Facebook gather every piece of information they possibly can about us for free, and then sell it to advertisers. This data is inaccurate and out of my control. I’d rather voluntarily provide excellent-quality, timely information about myself and my whereabouts, be in control of who gets it, and collect the rewards myself.MB: It’s 2027. What does the platform look like? And what Ethereum projects have stood the test of time?Golem is a global, open sourced, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access.HP: In 2027, Streamr is one of the core building blocks of modern apps: the real-time data pipeline of the decentralised web. Application developers have migrated from cloud platforms to superior decentralised services, such as computation containers (e.g. Golem), file storage (IPFS, Swarm), decentralised databases, and decentralised data pipelines such as Streamr.Data-driven decentralised apps and microservices can easily be built and deployed using a future version of the Streamr tooling, a predecessor of which is available today as the Streamr Editor and Engine. The Streamr Marketplace is a view into broadly useful content in the Streamr Network, including data from all business verticals such as finance, social media, IoT, smart cities, transport, health, and personal measurement.In the decentralised middleware space (which in my view includes Streamr, all blockchains, Golem, and many others), survivors will be the projects that unlock new business models and inspiringly cater that possibility to their communities. Middleware can only succeed if its users are able to succeed in building the actual end-user apps and real-world use cases.Streamr is a decentralized network for data to app delivery. It allows the publishing of new data to data streams.MB: Who’s the target audience?HP: The easiest wins are available for companies already producing and selling data or data services, such as device manufacturers, analytics companies, financial marketplaces, satellite operators, and so on. Currently they are doing it from within their silo because there is no other way, meaning they set up and manage their own delivery and payment infrastructure.For them it’s a no-brainer to open a new sales channel which is easy to onboard, plus these companies don’t need to be convinced that data sharing and monetisation are an opportunity because it already is at the core of their business model.MB: Have you forged any partnerships with other projects or businesses?HP: Sure! We have an official R&D partnership with Golem, as we are building complementary technologies which can become major building blocks of the future application development stack. We are also highly interested in decentralised computation, because it will benefit the Streamr Engine component of our stack.Of course we’re less than 100 days old but already we’ve got lots of companies, big and small, from several continents knocking at our door to talk about various use cases for the Streamr Network as well as about becoming participants in the Streamr Marketplace. One of those companies we’ve already announced is Zipper who are trying to put the blockchain on people’s phones. The process with blue chip companies is naturally slower. We’ll keep announcing interesting partnerships and pilots as they turn into something concrete.MB: What does the roadmap look like at the moment?Streamr raised 36,432 ETH from 1216 contributors during its initial coin offering.HP: We successfully funded the project in late October 2017, so we are in a rapidly accelerating phase. We have a centralised subset of the system up and running. It will be expanded and iteratively decentralised in various stages over the course of the project. A centralised starting point allows us to have a working system up and running from day one, which helps in building a community.Our roadmap is divided into three milestones, which consist of work packages related to the different components of the overall system. In 2017 we worked mostly on the Engine and Editor, which are the most interactive parts of the system. They are easy to show to people, and nicely lower the threshold of adoption. Currently we are working on the marketplace. In this recent update, I said we’ll have a functioning marketplace by the end of this year. Not just a prototype, but one that is actually being used to buy and sell data streams.Keep up with Streamr on their website, Twitter and Rocket Chat. I’d highly recommend checking out their tutorial for a feel of how the Engine will work.

610,CryptoSlate,A Glimpse Into SingularityNET: The Decentralized Protocol for Transacting AI Algorithms,Dylan Dedi,1516946400.0,"2018 is already forecasting the birth of many decentralized marketplaces. Blockchain and smart contracts are allowing users to trade without escrow services or centralized institutions. And this new technology is allowing for a marketplace that the world has never seen before.Sophia Hanson, chief Humanoid of SingularityNETThis marketplace will allow anybody to rent or use a piece of Sophia’s mind. In fact, all of the algorithms and pieces that created Sophia will be up for use via SingularityNET, as well as any other AI. It will be the first and largest AI marketplace, where anyone can buy or sell artificial intelligence.SingularityNET is a protocol for coordinating, discovering, and transacting AI algorithms at scale.AGI will be the token used in SingularityNET’s marketplace — there will only be 1 billion tokens ever in circulation, with the public ICO entry price at $0.10 per token.Now Trading on ExchangesAbout a week ago, the token was released on a few small exchanges, including Kucoin for the highest volume and Tidex with the second highest. When first released, the token peaked ar around $2.30 and is now averaging around $.74.It’s a bit more complicated to understand what the market cap is just yet, as only half of the tokens were released in the public sale. The tokens that are currently in circulation are just of the public token sale, which can give an estimated value of anywhere between $30-75 million market cap.But these numbers dwarf CEO Ben Goertzel’s estimates of what a decentralized AI marketplace can tap into. Currently, the AI marketplace is about a $122 billion market. By 2025, researchers estimate that this can become a $3.05 trillion market.Ben believes that the largest obstacle holding back AI innovation is lack of cooperation. Many great scientists are producing AI results but with no way to communicate these to each other. SingulairtyNET can become the center connection for humans and humanoids alike to trade artificial intelligence.How does SingularityNet work? Watch this short video (2:00)“SingularityNET is the first and only platform that allows AIs to cooperate and coordinate at scale. This removes one of the major limiting factors to AI growth today — the lack of interoperability — which severely restricts the ability to leverage the strengths and capabilities of individual AIs. No longer must AIs exist in silos, only capable of operating within a specific company, infrastructure, or industry.”-Ben GoertzelThere is an Alpha currently running on MetaMask’s Kovan testnet (AGI is an ERC20 token) of what the marketplace could look like. Check out our article about dApps, otherwise known as decentralized applications, to find out more about how to run testnets.Screenshot of what SingularityNET’s marketplace will look likeThe AGI token is a utility token that will make the marketplace seamless and organized. With so many different services on the market board, having the thousands of transactions go through one blockchain ledger will make all transactions transparent. Since there is no other use for the AGI token other than for the marketplace, all the transactions will be SingularityNET related.SingularityNET has recently partnered with Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange that will help people monetize their data. Other investors include NR Capital and SGInnovate. Many investors flocked to AGI’s ICO as the $36,000,000 cap was reached in 66 seconds. The whitelist demand was at $360+ million.Posted In: Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
611,CryptoSlate,How Wanchain is Rebuilding Finance with Private Cross-chain Smart Contracts,Ali Raza,1516857540.0,"As more blockchains are created, the need for cross-chain smart contracts becomes significantly greater. One of the most talked-about initial coin offerings over the past few months has been Wanchain — a platform whose goal is to build an interoperable distributed financial infrastructure.The Wanchain initial coin offering began in October 2017 and hit its hard cap almost immediately. Their fundraising goal was $36 million USD and they sold a total of 107,100,000 tokens for $0.34/token.Of the total tokens available, 51%, were made available with 42 million saved the development team and 39.9 million to the Wanchain Foundation.Wanchain TeamJack Lu, founder and CEO of Wanchain pictured with Ethereum inventor, Vitalik Buterin.The Wanchain team in China is the group that is leading the project development. This is the same group of people is also responsible for the creation, development, and popularization of the Factom project and its associated coin.The team is comprised of software engineers with ample experience in their respective fields, as well as blockchain expert advisors.One of the leaders is Jack Lu, who is the co-founder and CTO of Factom. That Factom platform is valued over $400 million and its digital currency is one of the top 50 according to the CryptoSlate crypto rankings.Other Key Wanchain Team MembersZane Liang: an applied mathematics expert with a Ph.D., he specialized in high-performance computing, cryptographic algorithms, and cryptographic security.Dustin Byington: a veteran blockchain entrepreneur, who has contributed his experience and knowledge in the Wanchain project. He founded the Bitcoin College in 2014.Welch Zhou: founder of the Hishare Exchange, he functions as the security Advisor of Hyperledger. He has over years of experience in government relationships, investment, and business management.Ying Zhang: works in tech company Huawei as a senior engineer, and is also a senior Ethereum developer. He is an expert in Wanchain issues such as smart contracts, blockchain architecture, and consensus algorithms.Lizzie Lu: A China Communication University graduate, she has accumulated years of the magazine, press, and television experience. She is a marketing expert and an organizer in the blockchain affiliations, community, and conferences.As we mentioned before, boasting a team of established industry veterans is one of the most important factors when judging a project and Wanchain seems to have figured that out. For a more detailed team intro, check out this official team introduction video by Wanchain:Wanchain RoadmapWanchain is a relatively young project, having started in June 2016. The first milestone on the roadmap has already been achieved: Wanchain 1.0, which includes:A user walletThe WanCoin tokenBlockchain explorerProof of stake consensus algorithmPrivacy protectionWanchain published its white paper in July of 2017.Wanchain 2.0 will launch in June of this year and among other things, will offer integration with Ethereum and also a multi-coin wallet.According to the product roadmap, developers will launch Wanchain 3.0 with Bitcoin integration, and the Wanchain 4.0 will likely come in 2019 and will include alliances with other private chains.The Wanchain roadmap is robust and specific. PartnershipsStrategic partnerships are imperative for any successful crypto project. Wanchain, Aion, and ICON formed what is now known as the Interoperability Alliance. These three blockchain platforms have come together to promote better connectivity between the different networks.According to Matt Spoke, which is the founder of Aion, “collaborating across projects will help set best practices for blockchain interoperability and encourage broader market adoption across enterprises and the public.”The group will encourage research in their common areas of work, which is the communication between distinct blockchains.In addition, DecentraNet and Wanchain recently announced an alliance. The former is a full-service blockchain consulting enterprise that can offer people assistance in community events, access to capital and deep industry alliances, whereas Wanchain has an infrastructure powered by cross-blockchain apps.Wanchain CommunityWanchain has a strong and vocal community for such young project — it currently boasts over 60k Twitter followers and over 11k subscribers on its subreddit.ConclusionThe Wanchain project is off to a great start because of the expertise of its founders and developers — they are all worthy blockchain industry entrepreneurs and engineers. Additionally, hitting its $36 million ICO hard-cap will mean it will be well-funded and likely to execute on its ambitious product roadmap.Although still early, the crypto community has warmly embraced the Wanchain project due to its strong leadership and potential uses cases. Although Wanchain has not yet disclosed a commercial strategy, it is an ambitious idea and worth watching in 2018.Posted In: China, Altcoins, Analysis, Enterprise, ICOs, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
612,CryptoSlate,"The Taller They Stand, The Harder They Fall: The Collapse of BitConnect",Matt Breen,1516164780.0,"It was common knowledge, to anyone having spent over 10 minutes conducting due diligence on BitConnect, that the platform was a textbook Ponzi scheme. The website makes bold claims as to how it can ‘guarantee’ returns, thanks to what it calls ‘volatility software’, as well as a Bitcoin trading bot. The legitimacy of these claims remains questionable, at best – there is no proof of anything going on behind the scenes.BitConnect billed itself as a “An open source, peer-to-peer, community driven decentralized cryptocurrency.” Most people thought of it as simply a ponzi scheme.Many speculated that the returns investors received were a mix of both the profits accrued from Bitcoin’s bullish price increase (to trade on the platform, users were required to purchase the native BCC token for Bitcoin), and the deposits from newer investors (locked up for close to a year).In classic HYIP style, this business model worked so long as more users were onboarded, which explains the focus on referrals that incentivised attracting friends, family, and followers to the platform.Dramatic Unravelling – Down 94% In 24 HoursThe writing was on the wall for BitConnect for some time now – the site had been subjected to DDoS attacks in the past few days, and received yet another cease-and-desist letter, whereby the platform was accused of dealing in unregistered securities (this marks the second this month, the first being from the state of Texas).1/2 Our counterparts at the Texas State Securities Board have ordered BitConnect, a $4B cryptocurrency promoter, to halt its fraudulent sales. https://t.co/y5No9YDdca— SEC Fort Worth (@FortWorth_SEC) January 5, 2018On the 16th of January, the site announced its shutdown, citing the above, as well as bad press, as reasons for its decision (worth noting is that it fully intends on continuing with its ‘BitconnectX’ ICO).BitConnect is down from a high of $338 in the past week, currently trading at $26.40 — a drop of 92%.The tokens locked up in active loans have been returned to their owners, but few see this as the act of good faith it purports to be – the current downtrend has plunged virtually every cryptocurrency into the red, though not many have fared as badly as BCC (down over 90% in the past week). Some exchanges have opened trading on the token, although, unsurprisingly, supply far outweighs demand.In the backlash, many are condemning the actions of some of the more prolific shills of the platform that took to YouTube to promote BitConnect.Some have begun to delete older content wherein they boast about the profit they’ve made, likely to distance themselves from the stigma (there are rumblings in cryptocurrency communities about legal action – it seems that, as the developers are anonymous, the known supporters have been targeted).Moving ForwardOn its website, BitConnect says it’s “a self regulated financial system”. The part they don’t mention is receiving cease-and-desist letters from actual regulators.I wrote about the impending collapse back in November. To many, it seemed blatantly obvious that BitConnect would come crashing down sooner rather than later, but the BitConnect subreddit stands as a bleak reminder that many are diving into cryptocurrency without informing themselves.It’s worth remembering that there are no guaranteed returns in crypto. We’re still at the beginning of what will surely be a turbulent adoption curve, with no real idea of what the future holds for the area. Flashy website design and Twitter hype mean nothing if the software isn’t there.Invest because you believe in the technology, not because the four-page whitepaper promises that XXXCoin is going to be the next Bitcoin. Don’t trust, verify.And please, for the love of all that is holy, don’t invest in the BitconnectX ICO.

That’s what we see right now as a slew of blockchain startups strive to make iterative changes to the fundamental features of blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Introducing RChainRChain is a transformation in blockchain technology that will empower users on the industry’s first scalable and safe blockchain.There are several blockchain platforms striving to be the solution to these problems. Founded by Greg Meredith, RChain is one of the latest blockchain initiatives to try and solve some of the problems plaguing the development of a large-scale blockchain ecosystem.RChain is a blockchain platform that’s the product of the Rchain Cooperative, a blockchain development organization based in Seattle, Washington.With an eye on security, scalability, and capability, RChain aims to supplant the dominate blockchains with a better version of themselves. RChain is nothing if not ambitious.According to GeekWire,“RChain claims that it will provide ‘content delivery at the scale of Facebook and support transactions at the speed of Visa.”Since Facebook has more than 2 billion active users and Visa can process 40,000 transactions per minute, that’s a pretty lofty goal.So how does it work? Watch this short video (1:51):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qftq9S34xggThe RChain’s Private Token SaleRChain was founded by Greg Meredith, a software engineer who has previously worked at Microsoft.To fund the project, RChain performed a private sale for its RHOC token with hopes of raising $15 million. RHOC is an ERC20 token with a $20 million hard cap with one RHOC worth $0.20 during the ICO.Initially, the token launch drew attention because of the high entry cost. Individuals had to place a minimum investment of $50,000 to participate.The token launch drew attention once again when it raised more than $5 million toward the project in just a single day.Aside from their audacious aspirations, one thing that sets RChain apart is its commitment to blockchain development. Unlike many ICOs that operate exclusively to maximize profits, RChain  requires investors to commit to doing something.Greg Heuss, an RChain adviser, notes,“We’re forcing buyers to say yes, I’ll do something to help, whether it’s looking at our financial models, stand up a node, or be a validator on the code…It’s not an investment – it’s a purchase and a promise to do something.”This may be RChain’s most endearing asset. They boast an earnest desire to proliferate blockchain technology and to be an active part of solving its most puzzling questions. This is demonstrated by the fact that the funds from their ICO are being put towards software development.Like many digital tokens, RHOC soared in value after its launch. The response was tepid immediately after the launch, and, at one point, the token even dropped below its ICO price. However, by the end of 2017, its value began to soar. By the new year, it was ready to spike, and it did. It’s since hit highs of more than $3 before settling around $2.50.In addition to the general crypto-mania sweeping the world, part of the enthusiasm for RHOC may originate with the outcomes of their developers retreat at the end of the year. At their meeting in Salt Lake City, the team made several developmental decisions that should clarify their approach going forward.They released a transaction pricing model that is more nuanced and divides the costs into four categories:ComputingNetworkingMemoryStorageRChain is based in Seattle, which is also home to Bittrex, Dragonchain, and many other blockchain-focused companies.Finally, RChain identified a specific enterprise use case to target. By addressing supply chain issues for pharmaceuticals, RChain has a targetable and tangible industry in its sights.Although the crypto-boom has created a significant amount of wealth through ICOs, it seems like everyone is chasing the most sustainable value by developing or investing in the first blockchain-based platform to achieve wide adoption at the enterprise level.To their credit, while many blockchain platforms identified supply chain management as a natural enterprise endeavor, few have narrowed the field as specifically as RChain has.There is no guarantee that they will be successful, but their attempt is worth following. That’s the only clear consensus around RChain. It offers no guarantees, but it’s an interesting endeavor that’s worth following.Posted In: Seattle, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
614,CryptoSlate,Vetting VeChain – a Blockchain Platform for Products and Information,Bill DeLisle,1515926820.0,"In an increasingly crowded but frustratingly similar ICO environment, platforms are looking for ways to differentiate themselves. Many companies have risen to prominence following the same playbook, using similar designs, and publishing the same-sounding articles. Now that the total value of the entire cryptocurrency market is approaching $1 trillion, there is at least some semblance of a change.Ironically, that change is usability. Go figure.People are paying more attention to platforms that boast a working product, have an established audience, and have a clear vision for achieving success. Ripple’s recent surge is evidence of this.Therefore, many people are looking for blockchain platforms that have enterprise-level initiatives in mind and that have the technical capability to see them through. One of the obvious applications for this is in supply chain management.Research and consulting firm, Deloitte, recommends that“Using blockchain in the supply chain can help participants record price, date, location, quality, certification, and other relevant information to more effectively manage the supply chain.”That’s what VeChain is striving to impact.So far, VeChain’s token has followed other digital tokens by surging in value after its launch. Initially priced around $0.25, by Christmas, 1 VET was worth about $1.50. 2018 has been extremely prosperous for VET token holders. Since the new year, VET quadrupled in price, and it’s now trading at more than $6.00.A Blockchain for the Supply ChainVeChain is a product identification management solution on the blockchain.VeChain is a blockchain platform secures the supply chain by verifying product authenticity. Using their VeChain Identity technology, they can effectively track shipments through tags that are readable using NFC, QR, or RFI identifiers.By outfitting a particular product with one of these tags, companies and customers can track this item throughout its production cycle and shipping journey. This is particularly useful for specialized products like certified organic grocery items or other products whose integrity is uniquely valuable.VeChain’s ability to insert itself into the battle over counterfeit or mislabeled goods could be a significant value-add for business, and it may have an outsized ability to help it expand as an enterprise solution.How does Vechain work? Watch this short video (1:34):Millennials are increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail environment, and their desire for ethically sourced products is changing the large-scale retail environment. As a result, brands are changing their strategies to accommodate their interests and proclivities. Supply chain management is a crucial component of these initiatives, so VEChain might be a “right time, right place” platform.Moreover, using the blockchain’s smart contract features, VeChain can track item ownership. In this case, sensitive valuables like jewelry could be documented from original sourcing all the way through transitional ownership. The tangible use cases for this feature is more abstract than simple supply chain management, but it’s easy to project some valuable use cases for this feature.Bigger Than the Moment?VeChain is more than just a blockchain platform. The VeChain Foundation is their research and development arm, and they are responsible for, among other things, developing partnerships in the business community.In November, the VeChain Foundation Steering committee held its first-ever meeting in Singapore. At this meeting, the platform underwent several changes that are mostly rebranding and marketing related.As of today, VeChain has established partnerships with PricewaterhouseCoopers, DNV GL, Renault Group, KUEHNE+NAGEL, D.I.G., China Unicom, and accumulated extensive experience in an ever expanding list of industries including pharmaceuticals, liquor, auto, luxury goods, retail, logistics, supply chain, food and cold storage, and more.First, as they advance their internal governance structure, they are dubbing this season “Apotheosis.” Taken literally, this naming indicates that the team views their current structure as the highest point of their development or the period where they finally reach their full potential. Deistic connotations notwithstanding, VeChain sees something important happening on their platform.All of this change precipitated a naming change for VeChain itself. VeChain is now called VeChain Thor, and its digital token will be converted from the existing tokens to VeChain Thor (VET) token. The foundation is adopting a “Proof of Authority” consensus mechanism that differentiates itself from many proof of work or proof of stake consensus models already employed by other blockchains.The VeChain Reddit community has over 23,000 members – an impressive number for a crypto project.VeChain’s rebranding and restructuring includes a complicated mix of hype and strategy, that could help propel VeChain to fulfill their vision for their platform, or it could be the type of hype restructuring that is less indicative of substance. Time will tell. Regardless, VeChain’s digital token has accelerated since these changes were announced.While it’s still unclear what the practical effect will be of all these changes, it does show that VeChain is willing to adapt and develop their platform to help it achieve its full potential.It has a clear market approach, and their services are in high demand. Still, there is always the danger the token’s tradeable value will supplant the actual relevance of the platform or that it could shift priorities within the organization.In the blockchain space, it can be difficult to differentiate substantive platforms from those that are merely trying really hard. VeChain is trying really hard, and it will be interesting to see if substance can follow.You can buy VeChain tokens on major exchanges such as Binance, Liqui, KuCoin, and HitBTC.Posted In: VeChain, China, Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
615,CryptoSlate,The Rise of RaiBlocks,Bill DeLisle,1515563340.0,"Bitcoin may have started the cryptocurrency party, but it’s all the uninvited guests that are having the most fun now. Throughout 2017, Bitcoin dominated headlines, gained followers, and increased in value by 1,500%. However, all this attention has increased Bitcoin’s resource usage, and there is much speculation as to how it will continue to scale.Even so, the Bitcoin community has stuck with the original 1MB block envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. Moreover, Bitcoin’s extremely high price is leaving many investors looking for cheaper investments that might blossom into the next Bitcoin-like boom.There are literally hundreds of alternative cryptocurrencies (alt coins), ready to meet this surging demand. Now, RaiBlocks’ XRB coin is surging.At the beginning of December, RaiBlocks was worth less than $1. Today, it trades for more than $27, a gain of more than 2500%. Even more impressively, most of this growth has taken place in the past week.RaiBlocks is designed from the ground up for instant, fee-less, scalable transactions.Even by crypto-standards where wild price swings can occur without warning or reason, this is a shocking price increase. In just a matter of weeks, RaiBlocks has emerged from relative obscurity to the twentieth largest cryptocurrency by market cap.What’s Causing the Price Surge?It’s always difficult to identify a single reason for a digital currency’s success, but RaiBlocks seems to have a few things working for it right now. It employs a rare approach to blockchain technology, it’s gaining increased exposure, and it’s becoming readily available through crypto-exchanges. According to its faithful following, RaiBlocks has been an undervalued coin for a long time.For starters, RaiBlocks addresses any immediate concern for the crypto-community, a top one being speed of transaction.As Harry Tucker notes in Finder,“RaiBlocks is both faster and cheaper than even Bitcoin Cash, with zero fees and is essentially instantaneous.”RaiBlocks accomplishes this by rejecting Bitcoin’s blockchain method, and instead implementing a system where every user is equipped with an individual blockchain. As a result, each block only includes a single transaction, and settlement times are instantaneous.In this way, RaiBlocks rejects the “mining” concept popularized by Bitcoin. Recent reports on the obscene amount of energy consumed by Bitcoin mining and the emergence of alternative blockchain methods have made minerless operations like RaiBlocks more attractive.ExposureThe RaiBlocks Reddit community has nearly 40,000 members – an impressive number for a cryptocurrency project.In methodology, RaiBlocks is closely linked to another digital currency, IOTA, which uses a similar minerless approach to their blockchain.IOTA is the tenth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, so it’s possible that some of RaiBlocks growth can be attributed to its connection to a similar, more prolific digital currency.Part of the alt-coin rise is a user preference for products that actually work.  Increasingly, because of high fees and long transaction times, Bitcoin just doesn’t work as it’s intended. Since it’s no longer rising by thousands of dollars a day, investors may be expressing a preference for altcoins that might prove to be a better functioning Bitcoin.Moreover, with so many crypto-enthusiasts desperately searching for the next Bitcoin-like price explosion, even a digital currency’s modest gains can attract investor attention, which increases the currency’s value and multiplies the exposure.AvailabilityOver 50% over Raiblocks volume typically comes from KuCoin.RaiBlocks recently concluded its captcha puzzle distribution. During this period, the only way to attain XRB coins was by completing their captcha puzzles, the RaiBlock version of crypto-mining.Now, XRB tokens are available through currency exchanges, and they just received some great news in that regard. On Friday, RaiBlocks announced on Twitter that their token would be available on the popular crypto-exchange, Binance, which earlier this week began allowing new user registrations after a temporary halt.. An official trading date has not yet been announced.RaiBlocks’ official Twitter account is very active, and they recently announced their inclusion on several other crypto-exchanges, so XRB is becoming available to a much broader audience.  That’s sure to drive up the currency’s demand.$XRB trading is now live on our biggest exchange to date, @kucoincom!— Nano (@nano) January 5, 2018We're also excited to announce that $XRB trading opened on @BitZExchange today!— RaiBlocks (@raiblocks) January 5, 20182018: The Year of the AltcoinIn comments to The Wall Street Journal about Ripple’s incredible price increase, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen said,“It’s amazing what’s going on…You’ve got to be standing in the middle of the road when the luck-truck hits you.”It’s hard to say if it’s luck or inevitability, but altcoins are making a serious run at the start of 2018, and they have definitely crashed Bitcoin’s party. As CNBC wrote last week,“Bitcoin’s dominance of the entire cryptocurrency market is at its lowest level ever.”RaiBlocks is just one reason that this is true, but they have put on a compelling show with their meteoric rise this week.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis, Opinion     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
616,CryptoSlate,A Beginner’s Guide to Dragonchain: An Innovative Cryptocurrency and ICO Platform,Austin Tuwiner,1515409080.0,"What do you get when you combine an innovative cryptocurrency, the resources of Disney and the tech-talent of Seattle? Answer: a very interesting project, team and ICO platform that has grown over 600% over the past few months.What is Dragonchain?Dragonchain provides a commercial platform for application developers to rapidly and securely deploy blockchain applications.Dragonchain (DRGN) is a business platform, incubator, marketplace and blockchain that operates through the use of the cryptocurrency Dragons. Dragonchain was drafted by a team under Disney. It was later handed off to the non-profit Dragonchain Foundation.How was Dragonchain Distributed?Dragonchain was initially distributed via an initial coin offering that took place from October 2nd until November 2, in 2017.Dragonchain’s initial coin offering had no cap on contributions, which means contributors received the amount of tokens equal to their total percent contributed. Dragonchain did not actually meet its funding goal, but decided to continue work on the project.55% of Dragons were distributed through the ICO. 20% was given to the team, 10% placed in reserves, 10% given to the foundation, and 5% placed in the Dragonfund.The price of Dragonchain (DRGN) is up over 600% over the past 3 months.What in the World is Dragonchain’s Incubator?The Dragonchain Crowd Scaled Incubator is a platform that allows smaller projects to use Dragonchain’s existing infrastructure to accelerate projects.An example of this is what Ethereum is to Dragonchain. Dragonchain runs on Ethereum’s blockchain similarly to OmiseGo or Monaco, but has its own tokens and features. ICOs can be run on Dragonchain’s platform, which will allow them to function before their own features are developed.Dragonchain users will have early access to these projects and discounts depending on their Dragonchain slumber score. The slumber score is calculated by multiplying the amount of coins you own by the length of time that you have been storing the coins.Holding Dragons on an exchange will NOT contribute to your Slumber Score. In order to get your score rolling, you will need to hold it on a wallet to which you own the private keys. Any transaction will reset your slumber score. This provides incentive for users to hold coins, which takes more of them off of the market.Here is a short video of how the Dragonchain Crowd Scaled works (1:19):How to Calculate Slumber ScoreIf you are interested in calculating your Dragonchain sleeper score, the official Dragonchain website has a calculator that lets you enter an ERC20 address. The calculator will scan your address, find its balance and spit out your score. Below is a more in-depth formula for the score.Other Dragonchain FeaturesThe Dragonchain marketplace is a decentralized exchange where smart contracts and other services related to marketing, legal, software development and recruiting can be exchanged with the Dragon tokens.PrivacyDragonchain plans to bring privacy to smart contracts. Smart contracts are conditional contracts that trigger when a certain condition is met. These contracts are stored on the blockchain, so they are completely decentralized.The information in these contracts can contain sensitive data such as customer records, so Dragonchain is trying to make the information as private as possible, while still allowing the data to be accessed and used.Coding FlexibilityAnother key feature of Dragonchain is coding flexibility. While Dragonchain is coded mostly in Python, its smart contracts support the following languages:JavaPythonNodeC#It is important for a cryptocurrency to support several programming languages, as not all businesses will use the same one. Ethereum, for example, requires projects and smart contracts to be written in Solidity, which is not the most beginner friendly or commonly used programming language.ERC-20The Ledger Nano S supports all ERC20 tokens, including Dragonchain.Dragonchain is an ERC-20 token, which means it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Dragonchain plans to eventually launch their own platform in 2018, but for now it uses Ethereum.Dragons can be stored on myEtherWallet, as well as the Ledger Nano S. The Ledger Nano S will support all ERC-20 tokens, including Dragonchain.Full Dragonchain support was recently added, so it is no longer necessary to add it as a custom token. Learn more about storing your Dragons here.How Do I Get my Hands on these Dragons!?KuCoin is an international blockchain assets exchange in South Korea.Dragonchain’s tokens are currently only available for purchase on KuCoin and EtherDelta.Kucoin is a Chinese exchange that lists several up and coming coins such as Dragonchain, as well as established coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Etherdelta is a decentralized exchange where you can trade from within your own Ether wallet.At the time of writing, Dragonchain is not listed on the major cryptocurrency exchanges like Poloniex, Bittrex or Binance.Ironically, Dragonchain’s headquarters in Seattle, Washington are right next to Bittrex’s offices. This seems rather convenient for an exchange addition, and could boost Dragonchain’s price even more.There are two routes I see in order for Dragonchain to be added to a different major exchange: Binance. Binance holds a coin of the month competition every month in which the community votes for a coin to be added.In January 2018, Dragonchain got 3rd place behind Raiblocks and Experience Points. It is very likely that we will see Dragonchain winning Coin of the Month in February, which would do wonders for the project and price.Binance also offers paid listings to their exchange. We were unable to find reliable information on pricing, but it seemed to be in the range of $90,000 to $100,000 USD.Can I Mine Dragonchain?Since Dragonchain is a token that runs on top of the Ethereum blockchain, it is not mineable. They have said that in the future that they are considering adding several sidechains, which may the potential to be mined. Dragonchain has a fixed supply of 433,494,437 DRGN and after that, there will be no more new Dragons created.Is Dragonchain Open Source?Yes, and if you are interested in viewing Dragonchain’s source code, you can check the official Dragonchain Github.So, What Makes Dragonchain Stand Out?On the Offical Dragonchain FAQ they answer the question: What makes Dragonchain different/better?They list the following reasons:Hybrid System that allows businesses to have their own chain.Limited exposure to smart contract dataMultiple currency support, on one chain.Multi-language smart contract interactivityServer less architecture via Amazon Web Services (AWS)Its own incubator and marketplaceIt will be interesting to see how Dragonchain compares to its competitors such as Ethereum, Enigma, and Cardano, as they all have similar goals and roadmaps. Dragonchain’s incubator and slumber score system, as well the marketplace definitely stand out against those coins.Dragonchain CommunityDragonchain has an active Reddit community of 1,181 readers. Although this is small relative to many other top coin projects, it is understandable given that Dragonchain is a relatively new project that has only recently begun trading.Dragonchain’s Twitter followers enjoy a much higher count — there are over 29,000 people following the @dragonchaingang Twitter account.What’s Next For Dragonchain?Dragonchain has some impressive things in the works, and I am excited to see where this project goes. If you want to keep up with the project, you can check its price here, and follow the Dragonchain team on Twitter.Posted In: Seattle, Altcoins, Analysis, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
617,CryptoSlate,Meet the Promising New ICO Platform From Stratis,Dylan Dedi,1515306000.0,"ICOs can be very scary to invest in. Ethereum, the first successful BaaS (Blockchain-As-A-Service) token, ran hundreds of ICOs (beginning largely this past summer).With no common interface, scams were too easy to happen; hacks were common since it was as simple as changing the receiving address on the ICO’s website. Many people lost Ethereum in the process and made many people skeptical of the whole process of contributing towards ICOs.Stratis is a powerful and flexible Blockchain Development Platform designed for the needs of real world enterprise and financial services.Stratis (STRAT) is an emerging and promising competitor to Ethereum — it is a BaaS token that started back in 2016 and has learned a lot from Ethereum.The Stratis development team has found a very simple way to integrate ICOs into its platform. The Stratis ICO Platform is a seamless interface that all ICOs using the Stratis network must comply with.The test network was run back in late November, and participants were able to test how easy it is to participate.Stratis is up 513% over the past three months.The Stratis ICO Platform is a secure, customizable platform for you to host your own ICO’s on the Stratis Blockchain Network. It has been developed from the ground up in C# and .NET Framework and is easily deployed within Azure.After receiving $TRSTAT from the test network, participants can look at their dashboard to see their funds, and which address they must send to for the ICO:These accounts include 2FA authentication, as well as a way to track how much the user has earned on their investment. This interface is going to make tracking all Stratis ICOs simple and clean; the first of its kind.Stratis FeaturesStratis has an incredibly strong suite of features that cater towards the enterprise and financial worlds. It’s blockchain-as-a-service features include:Stratis Academy – The Stratis Academy is dedicated to building a global C# and .Net blockchain developer community. Everything is rigorously documented and organized in the developer resource page on the Stratis main website. The idea is to encourage developers to write blockchain projects in these languages; the fight for blockchain language dominance reigns on as Ethereum uses Solidity, an entirely new language built by the Ethereum Network specifically for blockchain.Enterprise – Stratis’s blockchain is a full C# rewrite of Bitcoin’s protocol and consensus algorithm. C# is optimal for Windows/Microsoft environments, which is the main market that Stratis is aiming for. In fact, Microsoft is already integrating the Stratis Platform into their Azure BaaS program.Token – The Stratis token, called STRAT ($STRAT) is a Proof of Stake cryptocurrency that is on all major exchanges, including Poloniex, Bittrex, and even a fiat pairing on Bittylicious.Stratis Use CasesMedical – using the Stratis Blockchain to keep an immutable database of medical records.Provenance – the Stratis Blockchain can combat forgery and counterfeiting by keeping transactions transparent.Internet of Things (IoT) – IoT enabled blockchain can keep organized the vast array of IoT devicesFintech – Transparent records of bank dataLast but Not Least… Sidechains and PoSSidechains may be one of the most innovative ways to scale and compartmentalize a blockchain. Blockchain platforms building on Stratis can create a sidechain that will act as its own blockchain, while still being attached to the Stratis mainchain network. This relieves a lot of congestion from the mainchain and allows each sidechain to act independently.There has recently been a development update that focuses mainly on sidechain and smart contracts; in Q1 of 2018 smart contracts will be able to deploy onto sidechains.The official Stratis iOS app has a 5-star rating on the App Store.The update also includes the Stratis Identity App, which is an iOS application that is just waiting for approval by the Apple Store. It is already running on Android, and if you are a developer you can find more information here.Since Stratis is a proof of stake coin, you can earn rewards via staking your STRAT. You can estimate your earninga via the Stratis Pool Rewards calculator.Trading and WalletsStratis is available on all major exchanges (Bittrex, Poloniex, etc) via BTC or ETH (or if you are a UK resident you can buy with fiat via Bittylicious) and it can be stored in Stratis’s Staking Wallet or the Electrum Wallet.Stratis is a clearly a coin you should watch in 2018 as its aggressive development schedule and ICO platform will continue to attract new developers and real world use cases.Posted In: Altcoins, Enterprise, Technology     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
618,CryptoSlate,Ethereum’s Raiden Network: An Off-Chain Solution to Scalable Payments,Dylan Dedi,1514803860.0,"Vitalik Buterin predicted in September 2017 that it will take a “couple of years” for the Ethereum Network to reach Visa-like capacity. Raiden (RDN) is one of the more notable efforts making progress towards this goal, using “off-chain” technologies to increase network capacity.The Raiden Network is an off-chain scaling solution, enabling near-instant, low-fee and scalable payments.The second most valuable token on the market is quietly building all of the infrastructure needed act as a staple for the way blockchain is used. Ethereum, a BAAS (blockchain as a service) token, has hundreds of groups and projects building their foundation on the Ethereum Network using the ERC20 token standard.Some of the largest crypto companies, such as Consensys, are investing millions into the Ethereum framework.In a rather strategic and quiet manner, Raiden then released its first Micro Raiden Bug Bounty back on November 30th of this year.While Raiden sounds great on paper, the ICO was never supposed to happen and there was never supposed to be a token attached to it.Raiden promised a very quiet ICO and little marketing so that they can get the funds needed to make the project happen. This controversy seems to have contributed to a lack of demand for RDN, but investors are still betting that the off-chain tech will be a big win for Ethereum.What is Raiden?Raiden is very similar to the Lightning Network. It is Ethereum’s off chain layer that will provide instant transactions for a fraction of the price. How does it work? Watch this short video (1:42):The goal of the off-chain solution is to alleviate stress from the main chain; to keep fees for Ethereum low and transactions running smoothly.Similarly to the Lightning Network, Alice doesn’t need direct payment channel connections to pay Dave the barista — if Dave knows Cindy and Alice knows Bob, and Bob and Cindy know each other, the payment channels can communicate with each other to make the transaction happen.It will also be ERC20 compatible. This means that every single ERC20 token, as well as Ethereum, will work with Raiden.This creates huge benefits in Ethereum’s multi-token ecosystem because it will create many more use cases than the Lightning Network currently can. Payment channels can be created for specific tokens that require constant transactions.Grid+ leverages the Ethereum blockchain to give consumers direct access to wholesale energy markets, responding intelligently to changes in energy prices.For example, Grid+ (GRID), a blockchain solution for decentralizing and distributing energy generated by customers, is an ERC20 token that has already partnered with Raiden. They will use the network to batch transactions in their system, which will alleviate Ethereum’s main chain as well as save Grid+ gas fees.In fact, many companies have already partnered with Raiden. Enjin (ENJ), SmartMesh, and the Energy Network Foundation are a few large companies that see the advantages to incorporating Raiden transactions into their networks.Micro Raiden – Fast p2p PaymentsMicro Raiden (or µRaiden) is a system within the Raiden Network that has been built to create fast p2p micropayments. This is different from the Raiden Network in the sense that the Raiden Network will be more flexible, allowing multihop transfers for transactions to happen, while Micro Raiden creates super fast, unidirectional transfers that have zero fees (besides the gas cost of opening and closing a channel).Micro Raiden’s eyes are on the IoT market, M2M (machine-to-machine) markets, and pay-per-use subscriptions. A demo can be tried here to get an idea of how developers imagine it operating.Atomic Swaps and raidEXraidEX is fully interoperable and leverages synergies with tokens and apps in the Ethereum ecosystem.RaidEX, a decentralized exchange built on the Raiden Network, has made use of Raiden’s atomic swap feature. Raiden’s atomic swaps allow for all ERC20 tokens to be interchangeable.Users with multiple ERC20 tokens will be able to instantly swap for other ERC20 tokens without a third party with far lower transaction costs.ICO ControversySince an ICO was never originally intended, many saw it as a money grab. Raiden didn’t give much of a heads up or explanation to why they wanted to do an ICO:So disappointed to see Raiden (i.e. Lightning on Ethereum) go for a cash grab. A token is not needed. 🤑5+ LN teams on Bitcoin and no ICOs. https://t.co/A3XNoWnDGZ— Charlie Lee [LTC] (@SatoshiLite) September 22, 2017Vitalik also expressed his concern about the surprise ICO:I wish they didn't but I totally understand why they did and do not blame them. Hence (ii) as my small part in providing alternatives— Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) September 22, 2017Plasma is a proposed framework for incentivized and enforced execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum NetworkWhile the tech is sound, the intentions may not align with Ethereum. Vitalik announced along with Joseph Poon another scaling solution called Plasma, which is still very early in the works and initially being designed to work with the OmiseGo payment network.Raiden is functioning now and offering great solutions for Ethereum’s scaling issue, but Plasma (which will not have an ICO) might become the Ethereum Foundation’s go-to solution for scaling.That being said, Ethereum is large enough to incorporate both into its ecosystem, and Raiden has no intentions of slowing down.Regardless of what happens, 2018 promises to be an interesting and pivotal year for blockchain scaling!Posted In: Ethereum, Altcoins, Payments     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
619,CryptoSlate,Exploring Waves — A Blockchain Platform,Eliot Prince,1514613180.0,"With over 1300 cryptocurrencies and a never-ending supply of new ICOs, it can be next to impossible to stay up to date with new projects, let alone the established ones. While most cryptocurrency investors have probably heard about Waves, it may not be one everyone is completely familiar with.Introduction to WavesWaves claims they are the fastest blockchain in the world — their technology allows them to handle hundreds of transactions per second.Waves is a blockchain and cryptocurrency that was launched in 2016. The network aims to make creating, managing and storing digital assets easy and secure whilst opening up the advantages of blockchain technology to the wider world.Accompanying the native currency, Waves, users can simply create new tokens in order to operate ICO and crowdfunding projects. The platform is also working to break barriers between fiat and cryptocurrencies with gateways that connect banks to the blockchain.With the ability to run ICOs and smart smart contracts, some have drawn comparisons to the Ethereum network but similarities to Kickstarter, thanks to the crowdfunding abilities also become apparent.Gaining nearly $1.5 billion market cap since its release, Waves originally funded via an impressive $16 million ICO. It is now one of the world’s top 30 coins with a total supply of 100 million that currently trades upwards of $13.“Waves is a decentralized platform that allows any user to issue, transfer, swap and trade custom tokens directly on the blockchain.”The price of Waves is up 270% over the past three months, having recently peaked at $17.20.So how does the Waves platform work? Watch this short video (1:32):TokenizationWaves’ major unique selling proposition arrives in the form of custom token creation. On the platform, users develop their own digital tokens to issue, transfer, swap and trade directly on the blockchain.Unlike its competitors, Waves makes it easy for anyone to create tokens without any previous coding experience or knowledge. In almost no time, new digital assets are available for creation backed by Waves. With just the Waves token, businesses, organizations and institutions can create their own tokens that contain a custom name, issue amount and number of decimal fractions.The simple user-friendly nature of the technology poses a perfect alternative choice for blockchain-led crowdfunding projects.A total of 7,874 tokens have been released on Waves – totaling a market capitalisation of more than $1,000,000,000.Concerns have risen as to how the service will be monitored moving forward to make sure there is not a messy amount of useless tokens floating around the network.Crowdfunding companies like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have a stringent application process to make sure funding is safe and trustworthy. In December Indiegogo announced a new ICO and Blockchain Investment service that could offer similar benefits to Waves.Interestingly, a recent partnership between Waves and Deloitte formed to launch a regulatory body to set standards for initial coin offerings.“In addition to that, one of our objectives is to develop the legal mechanisms for regulating ICO projects. Currently, no such mechanisms exist in the market. This will help the companies to safeguard themselves from project risks and challenges after they complete the initial offering of tokens.”– DeloittePrimalbase Primalbase is an example of an project that completed its ICO on the Waves platform – it raised over 3000BTC during its crowdsale.Building upon the well-established business model of shared workspaces, the Primalbase project transforms traditional office rental into a new-generation community-based ecosystem where one can share, sell or rent out high-quality office spaces using Ethereum and Waves-based digital tokens.MobileGoAnother popular ICO from 2017, MobileGo, also used the Waves platform to raise $53 million during its crowdsale.MobileGo aims to bring the advantages of cryptocurrency to the gaming industry by using smart contracts to power peer-to-peer eSports tournaments. The project is creating a community of gamers and developers around the GStore – an open platform on which all games are purchased for the game credits cryptocurrency.GatewaysIn 2017 Waves partnered with Deloitte – Deloitte, a UK-incorporated multinational professional services network.In order to facilitate the tokenization on the network, the Waves team are working to initiate gateways between fiat and cryptocurrencies. The idea is to enable users to fluidly move funds from banking and payment industries into cryptocurrency.For example, a recent Euro gateway was added to the platform which enables people to store funds as a Euro-backed token and use them with all the added benefits of the blockchain.It continues to be a clunky process moving between fiat and crypto with investors requiring trading platforms or credit card purchases which are still niche and alien to most of the world. For ICOs and other investments, most people will first buy Bitcoin before trading to ether and then purchasing tokens. All of which can become more expensive and time-consuming that it should be.Waves aims to open direct routes between fiat, Bitcoin and others to break down these barriers. The platform is trying to mainstream cryptocurrencies with fluid on-off ramps for those with minimal coding and technical experience. Partnerships with payment services will allow for the standardization of this process.Automated DecentralizationIronically, cryptocurrencies often need a central exchange to trade decentralized assets. However, when it comes to trading Waves tokens, one can use their decentralized exchange (Dex).The Waves Dex uses a centralised matcher and high channel capacity allow traders to make deals as quickly as on a centralised exchange, but without the risk of losing one’s money.Whilst it is not the only one that has been developed, the Waves Dex provides an edge over competitors thanks to the Dollar, Euro and Yuan gateways. Adding to this is smart contracting abilities that provide automation to the blockchain. Applications are built away from the network and are then added on in a similar fashion to a plug-in.Waves’ Consensus MechanismFinally, Waves also has an interesting consensus method that audits the network. While using proof of stake consensus models are nothing new, a lease option opens up mining to everybody. 10,000 Waves is required to become a full node and start auditing the network.These nodes then earn a small amount from transaction fees, almost like earning interest on the investment. Waves allows blockchain users to pool funds by leasing coins to nodes if they don’t have the 10,000 minimum Waves balance.It has to be said that returns are small and will be for the foreseeable future, but the rapid network growth makes it another speculative investment in the cryptocurrency world.SummaryFeatures like an ICO platform, crowdfunding, voting and smart contracting makes Waves a hugely flexible and useful tool.Adding fiat gateways is an added bonus that could bring real fluidity to the industry. A redesigned client interface now makes it easier than ever for users to start with Waves.Its design matches up to the best banking and trading apps enabling anyone to profit from the powerful system without the need for previous blockchain experience.If the platform heavily links with banking and financial institutions its future will be a bright one. Expect Waves to continue disrupting the tokenization and crypto markets in 2018.Posted In: Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
620,CryptoSlate,Examining EOS as a Platform and Cryptocurrency,Bill DeLisle,1514457960.0,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enjoying a manic year in which value increases of thousands of percent are not uncommon and in which obscure currencies once relegated to the fringes of the internet are being catapulted into the mainstream.It’s pretty incredible, and it’s not the best thing about cryptocurrencies.The underlying technology, the blockchain, is gaining notoriety because of the ways that it effectively secures and records cryptocurrency transactions. It’s finding inroads at significant companies like J.P. Morgan Chase, Microsoft, Intel, and MasterCard.“The blockchain will be bigger than you can imagine, and getting there will be harder than everybody expected, writes research and consulting firm Deloitte.That’s why EOS exists.EOS bills itself as “The Most Powerful Infrastructure for Decentralized Applications.”The brainchild of programmer, Dan Larimer, EOS may be making the jump from a dubious startup with an incredulous vision to a viable network ready to proliferate the blockchain ecosystem. This isn’t Larimer’s first project.He’s a prolific and controversial blockchain enthusiast who already developed and departed a cryptocurrency exchange, BitShares, and a Reddit-like social media platform, Steem.Larimer maintains that each of these projects solved for limitations in the blockchain ecosystem. In a way, Larimer seems to see himself as an angel developer who swoops in to solve a problem before departing for another crisis.With the recent DAWN 2.0 release, EOS is striving to capitalize on the blockchain’s possibilities by making it easier for developers to create decentralized autonomous applications (dApps).They have ambitious goals that are highly reliant on the broader development community to proliferate their work, but, if they are successful, EOS could be a model in the mold of Ethereum for creating decentralized networks that are populated with usable, autonomous applications that function like a better version of the internet that we already know and love.EOS as a PlatformDon Larimer is the founder of EOS.EOS was created by Block.one, EOS is similar to the Ethereum blockchain in that it utilizes the blockchain and its associated smart contracts and native currencies to create a decentralized ecosystem for app development.EOS plans to differentiate itself through speed. Its Developers made claims of up to 50,000 transactions per second, which is far more than most popular blockchains.Designed with scaling in mind, EOS makes several claims about its potential to solve for the relatively sluggish state of blockchain transactions.The DAWN 2.0 release will give developers an opportunity to test these promises, and their technical roadmap shows that EOS is already looking ahead to platform limitations and developer concerns.EOS as a CryptocurrencyThe EOS token is a relatively new digital currency. It launched in July, and until last month, it maintained its modest launch price of around $1. At the end of November, EOS began a sharp accent, ultimately settling topping out at almost $13.Three months ago, the price of EOS was less than a dollar. It now sits at $7.69, a gain of more than 1000%.Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that,“Of the 30 biggest digital tokens sold in ICOs this year, the ones without a working product backing their product did the best.”Although EOS emerged in this environment, it’s evidence that investors have less tolerance for baseless projects. As crypto markets become more mainstream, there is increased skepticism over baseless ICOs, which, until its BETA release this month, EOS was criticized by some as being.Moreover, EOS maintains that its digital token does not have “any rights, uses, purposes, attributes, functionalities or features on the EOS platform.” Such a broad and unmitigated statement lends fodder to the assertions that EOS represents the worst of the ICO boom rather than the transformative platform that they promised.EOS in the futureEven though EOS is being traded on coin exchanges, it is also technically still in its ICO — the Token distribution takes place over 341 days which is expected to “provide ample time for the community to familiarize themselves with the project, as well as participate in the distribution.”Now that EOS has officially launched a testable product, its future is wide open. While several developmental flaws have already been discovered, those are fixable issues that are inherent in all new projects.The biggest unknown is Larimer’s commitment to the project’s fruition. Whether fair or not, Larimer has a perceived reputation as a developer who constructs a platform only to abandon it as it begins to germinate.However, Larimer cites increased professionalism and a supportive advisory team as evidence that his old ways are behind him.“I’m working with an extremely professional team that is managing EOS at a higher level than the previous projects,” Larimer told Coin Desk.There is no doubt that decentralized applications and blockchain integration will be significant components of the next wave of technology. Whether EOS is at the forefront of that trend or whether it is relegated to a footnote in the development process is still being determined. Regardless, it is certainly a coin to keep on your radar in 2018.Posted In: EOS, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
621,CryptoSlate,Why You Should Keep Qtum on Your Radar in 2018,Eliot Prince,1514268600.0,"When most people think of blockchain projects in China, their first thought is NEO, the “Chinese Ethereum” that was launched in 2014 as AntShares. However, in the past year, another Chinese blockchain has skyrocketed almost 20,000% since its initial coin offering.Founded in 2016 and led by CEO Patrick Dai, Qtum (pronounced “Quantum) recently moved into the top 15 with a market cap of over $13 billion ahead of Zcash, Lisk, Ethereum Classic and Neo.This past month saw more dramatic price increases for cryptocurrencies across the board. At times, Bitcoin traded near $20,000 before a healthy correction over the past week. Qtum’s gains have been exceptionally impressive, following altcoins including Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ripple in price breakouts even doubling in a 24 hour period during December.Qtum has had an impressive month – its price is up 340% since the beginning of December.Qtum reached a new all-time high of over $70 on 19th December, up from around $12 just 10 days prior. Its price has since retreated below $50 which is still very healthy, considering the token had only traded between $5 and $15 since May.What is Qtum?Qtum was is a Chinese blockchain project that uses smart contracts and PoS 3.0.Qtum is an open-source blockchain and cryptocurrency project led by The Qtum Foundation. A wide selection of developers, blockchain and internet professionals make up the team, including Neil Mahi and Jordan Earls, both multiyear veterans in the cryptocurrency/blockchain space.The idea of Qtum is built upon pulling together the most successful and reliable blockchain technologies to build a network for real-world business applicationsQtum takes concepts and established code from blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and merges them together to create a better all-around package.How does it work? Watch this short video (1:33):Forbes Magazine put QTUM CEO Patrick Dai on the Chinese edition of the “30-under-30” list with Chinese innovators, entrepreneurs and leaders.Smart contracting, as already seen with Ethereum and NEO, is available through Qtum combined with Bitcoin’s UTXO (aka “unspent transaction output”) which is used by nodes to match and validate transactions from its database.Added to this is a proof of stake consensus which QTUM believe is more practical for business enactment.Blending these concepts together in Bitcoin’s reliability and smart contracts provides an opportunity for real-world use to the blockchain which many enterprises have been patiently waiting for.Combining a modified Bitcoin Core infrastructure with an intercompatible version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Qtum merges the reliability of Bitcoin’s unfailing blockchain with the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts.Qtum knows improving on the existing blockchain technologies is paramount for its success and focuses heavily on introducing accessible options for the business world. The aim is to fuse the blockchain and business worlds.Many draw comparisons, including Qtum, to the Ethereum project but a shifted focus could be what gives this up and comer the edge.December signalled a significant milestone as the work in building dApps (Decentralized Applications) saw the market cap smash through $3 billion and over another major Chinese competitor – NEO.The push for real-world use is evident throughout the project. Users are able to create their own tokens, automate tasks and self-execute agreements in a trusted and stable environment.Building on these technologies, Qtum aims to introduce a library of smart contacts to offer instantaneous accessibility. Industry professionals will be able to select from a range of off the shelf agreements for supply chain management, telecommunications, social networking and many more. Benefits of smart contracting are applicable to almost any industry.Qtum’s Mobile PushMobile adoption is key to the success of any internet and networking-based technology. Many cryptocurrency investors and blockchain developers will be hoping that digital currency takes hold of the world in a similar fashion to smartphones.In 2016, mobile internet use surpassed desktop for the first time. How many years will it be until cryptocurrency surpasses fiat money?Smartphones and tablets will be crucial in this mass uptake whether this is for personal or business uses.Qtum is looking to push mobile blockchain development to new levels and its use of Bitcoin’s UTXO, which will allow smart contracts to be executed from light wallets (nodes not syncing the entire blockchain) on mobile devices. Qtum’s dApps are readying for the mobile age.With this angle, it provides Qtum with the opportunity to disrupt both the blockchain and internet traffic in a new exciting way.The blockchain is finally ready to take up disruption in a world in which half of all internet traffic is being generated by smartphones and tablets.– QtumThe combination of tested code merges reliability with the versatility to offer endless opportunities for institutions and industries around the globe.We’re all searching for the first fully-fledged real-world application of cryptocurrency and blockchain. The industry is now perfectly poised for a continuing boom throughout 2018.Qtum’s Commitment to TransparencyVevue is one of a handful Qtum tokens which are in ICO and plan to release in 2018.Qtum is a model project when it comes to transparency and regular updates. On their Medium blog, they provide weekly community and development updates.For example, this week they announced their founder attended an Internet Governance Forum in Geneva as well as a new ICO taking place on their platform called Vevue – a simple way for anyone to earn tokens through social sharing.Any developments grabbing hold of a real-world application that is genuine and useful will be in good stead for the future. Qtum may well be an example of this and is certainly one to watch in the coming months.Posted In: China, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
622,CryptoSlate,Einsteinium – What Is It and Where Is It Going,Bill DeLisle,1514096700.0,"This year, cryptocurrencies are demonstrating their financial prowess as they rapidly increase in value. With a total market cap of more than $500 billion, this vast ecosystem is loaded with digital currencies that are more valuable and more usable than ever. What’s not considered on these charts is the creativity embedded in some of these coins.Although it’s currently priced at just $0.92 USD, which doesn’t place it anywhere near the most valuable cryptocurrencies, Einsteinium deserves recognition for creativity.EMC2 began the year valued at just $0.000875 per coin – not even worth a tenth of one cent. As of Dec. 24, its value had increased to $0.92 per coin — a gain of more than 100,000%.The Einsteinium Foundation’s mission is to raise funds for scientific research.First launched in 2014, Einsteinium is a unique cryptocurrency that combines the standard p2p ambitions with a philanthropic underpinning that strives to fund scientific research through its platform.It uses a proof of work concept that is similar to Bitcoin, and, aside from the popularity difference, it operates in much the same way. In essence, Einsteinium is a combination of Bitcoin’s technological capability with the ethos of a charity.A New Fundraising ModelEinsteinium runs on the Proof-Of-Work scrypt algorithm. The total amount coins that will be in circulation after the mining is 299 million coins (after 730 Epochs).Einsteinium’s methodology is simple but is pretty compelling. Their coin, EMC2, is a tradeable digital currency that has soared in value this year. Throughout its first two years, EMC2  traded at a fraction of a cent. In other words, it was a functionally worthless currency.However, the crypto boom of 2017 has extended to Einsteinium as well. In November, EMC2 began an unprecedented climb that ultimately led its value past $2.50, though with the recent crypto correction, it is now trading for around $0.92 USD.This is good timing — on March 1st, Einsteinium launched the Einsteinium Foundation, which is an officially registered non-profit in Canada, and it’s one of the first NPOs in the crypto space. The funding mechanism for this nonprofit is built into the crypto mining process. Of the fees generated by mining EMC2, 0.5% goes to the organizations fundraising costs while another 2% is directly contributed to funding for scientific research.Interestingly, the mining community has an opportunity to vote for the projects that they want to fund. Funding is accrued in Epoch cycles, which are the approximately 25 days that it takes miners to build 36,000 blocks onto their public ledger. At the completion of each Epoch, miners have the opportunity to vote on the projects that they will support with their funding.A Unique Approach to Crypto MiningAs of September 2017, the Einsteinium Foundation decided to remove the ‘Wormhole’ feature from the coin which reduced the total supply by 55075320 coins.Einsteinium uses a reductive approach to mining rewards. Essentially, as more blocks are mined, the reward for doing so becomes less.Prior to a September 2017 hard fork, Einsteinium used a unique approach that they have dubbed a “wormhole event” in which a random event within each Epoch rewards a miner with a significantly higher than normal reward.Therefore, while the general payoff lessens over time, the possibility of a wormhole reward should incentivize participants to continue to contribute their computing power to maintaining the Einsteinium blockchain.Additionally, to help invigorate their currency, Einsteinium recently implemented the September 2017 hard fork that reduced EMC2 supply by 25%.This can be perceived as a strategic move to enhance Einsteinium’s value at this critical time, but it can also be interpreted as a last-ditch effort to shore up the currency’s value after years of stagnation. Differentiating the difference between these two motives is one of the most tenuous aspects of the platform.A Shotgun Entry into the FutureAs of December 24, 2017, Einsteinium has a market cap of ~$200 million.Einsteinium has robust plans for its future that don’t inherently correlate to their fundraising vision. For example, since Einsteinium has many of the same qualities as Bitcoin, they see its future adoption in p2p or even integrated ecosystem transactions as a vital part of their future.After a much-hyped announcement on December 19th failed to deliver the excitement and forward-thinking developments that users had hoped for, the currency dropped nearly 40%, swaths of  confused investors filled chatrooms, forums and Reddit with their misgivings.The announcement revealed Einsteinium is updating its mining algorithm to make it ASIC resistant and to make it more GPU friendly, which will help its mining become even more decentralized.Although many of their community members expressed frustration with the announcement, Einsteinium maintains that the change reflects emerging best practices in the industry and ensures that their research-enabling platform is utilizing the latest research and technology to mature the platform.While the past two months are exciting for Einsteinium and its supporters, it’s difficult to tell if EMC2 is taking off on its merit or if it is merely reflecting the general enthusiasm surrounding cryptocurrencies.Regardless, Einsteinium’s combination of currency and philanthropy is a novel idea, and it’s unlikely that they will be the last project to produce an iteration of this concept.Posted In: Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
623,CryptoSlate,A Look Into Lisk and Why It’s Up 148x This Year,Bill DeLisle,1513837800.0,"LISK (LSK) is up 45% over the past 24 hours on a strong cryptocurrency market and the news of the official 0.91 Lisk Core application release.Lisk was founded in May of 2016 as a fork of Crypti.Lisk has been gaining notoriety the entire year, not only because of its early valuations but because of the ecosystem that it’s developing alongside its currency.In many ways, Lisk is the embodiment of the cryptocurrency ethos. It’s a digital currency that can be traded through crypto exchanges, it’s a decentralized application (dApp) development platform, and it’s a forward-thinking blockchain that uses new methods to produce better products.Lisk as a CryptocurrencyLisk launched as an ICO in May 2016. This is the same process that started currencies like Ethereum and NEO, but that has also led to increasingly massive capital campaigns for startups. Through its ICO, Lisk raised almost $6 million, and at the time it was the second most successful ICO in history.Lisk began 2017 trading at $0.17 USD and is currently sitting at $25.30, a gain of 14,800%.After hovering at a fraction of a dollar for most of its first year, the Lisk token (LSK) has quickly accelerated this year. It currently trades at more than $25, which, on a percentage basis, is as impressive of an improvement as any cryptocurrency available.Of course, Lisk isn’t a commodity. It’s a digital currency that can be used to facilitate p2p transactions. Its primary differentiator is its speed. According to the Lisk Blog, to send LSK from one account to another takes 10 seconds, after about 1-2 minutes the transaction is immutable.”This is significantly faster than other mainstream cryptocurrencies, and it’s representative of Lisk’s approach to the crypto ecosystem.dApp Development PlatformThere is no shortage of blockchain startups right now. However, Lisk is born out of frustration with the current blockchain offerings and the problems that arise when these projects begin to scale. In theory, Lisk is intended to function similarly to Ethereum because it’s a platform where others can build their platforms.In practice, Lisk takes a novel approach to blockchain development. Rather than using a public ledger, Lisk operates in modules, which allows each decentralized application developer to operate on a side chain.Blockchain applications can be written in the popular programming language Javascript. Every app will run in its own sidechain to ensure that Lisk itself stays safe and scalable.When blockchain projects begin to scale, the new network congestion slows everything down. Transactions take longer to process, apps take longer to load, and the immediacy of the blockchain is replaced by antiquated wait times.By operating in a modular structure, Lisk can circumvent these problems while also giving developers access to a broad ecosystem of customers, services, and applications. It’s a perfect balance of autonomy and unity that allows everyone to thrive.On the Lisk platform, developers use JavaScript to program their dApps This is one of the most common computer languages available, and some of the most significant companies on the planet, including Google and Microsoft, are actively advancing the language to make it more capable and secure.Lisk is an inclusive platform that will use the skills and ideas of the development community to continually improve the capabilities of its blockchain while also increasing the capabilities of blockchain-based applications.Most importantly, Lisk is striving to be a collaborator in the blockchain space, not a replacement blockchain for Ethereum or Bitcoin. By utilizing plugins to other blockchain services, Lisk is allowing a best-of-both-worlds scenario to maximize the capabilities of blockchain platforms.The Future of Lisk2017 has been a breakout year for cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications. Its broad use cases, and the large-scale investments by some of the biggest companies in the world seem to guarantee its prominence well into the future.However, the maturation of these platforms is inevitable, and that’s the next step for Lisk. The community is anxiously awaiting the 1.0 release of the Lisk Core application. Lisk also plans on rebranding sometime in early 2018.Additionally, a number of ICOs are supposed to be launching as sidechains in 2018 on the Lisk platform. One example is Moosecoin which is a decentralized organization for musicians.Important questions about security, usability, and scalability will be addressed and developed this year, and, as the ecosystem becomes increasingly crowded, its role among the competition will solidify.Lisk enjoyed an encouraging start, and the future is now being determined.Posted In: Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
624,CryptoSlate,A Deeper Dive Into Dash and Its Explosive Year,Dylan Dedi,1513753740.0,"Dash (DASH) is having a phenomenal year — just one year ago, Dash was worth about $10 per coin. This past week, Dash broke the $1000 barrier and at press time is trading for $1531.Dash runs a proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.A portmanteau of “Digital Cash,” Dash aims to be just that: a realistic, reliable digital cash solution for the global economy.While Bitcoin and Ethereum look for off chain solutions to scalability, Dash has a rather ingenious on-chain solution to keep all transaction validations on the blockchain.The RiseIn June of 2017, Dash really started to take off — the daily trade volume spiked to $100 million/day several times throughout the month and it became the one of the most talked about coins on Bitcoin Talk.ASU is one of the largest colleges in the U.S. with a population of 71,946 students.Dash’s developer community eventually reached to 30 full-time and 20 part-time employees, all who are paid by Dash’s budget system. This budget system is run by crypto’s first ever DAO, otherwise known as a decentralized autonomous organization.In August of this year, Dash partnered with Arizona State University to create a blockchain research lab. According to it’s press release:Initial research will focus on blockchain scalability, best practice, network architecture, environmentally -friendly mining, latency and throughput. Work will commence this month, and as the partnership progresses, may also include on-campus student lessons taught by Dash Core executives.This positive news sent Dash price price to new all time highs and demonstrated that there is a strong demand for blockchain research within academic settings.Dash began the year at $11.62 and is currently sitting at $1389 – a gain of more than 11,900%.History of DashEvan Duffield founded DASH in 2014.Dash started out as XCoin back in 2014. One month later, it was rebranded to DarkCoin. One year and a month after that (March 2015), DarkCoin was rebranded to Dash.During the XCoin days, the release came off to a rocky start: The initial fork led to a bug that allowed 10% of the entire supply of Dash to be mined by whoever was mining at the time.Evan Duffield, the founder of Dash, tried to rectify this by starting over or airdropping to broaden the distribution; the community rejected his ideas and decided to go forward with development.This led Dash to be sold at a very low price on exchanges, which eventually distributed the Dash network more evenly.How does it work? Watch this video (1:40):MasternodesMasternodes are computers that run a dash wallet and make decisions, such as locking transactions with InstantSend, coordinate mixing of coins, and voting on budget funding.While Bitcoin needs miners to take care of creating new blocks and validating transactions, Dash needs miners just to create new blocks; Masternodes own an entire copy of the blockchain and perform services for the network such as voting, PrivateSend, and InstantSend.Because responsibilities are split between Masternodes and miners, Masternodes receive 45% of each block reward. Miners receive 45% and Dash’s DAO budget system receives 10%.To become a Masternode, you must own 1000 Dash. This prevents Sybil attacks, a p2p attack that can happen when the hacker is assuming a large number of pseudonymous identities against a reputation system.There are currently about 4600 Masternodes in the network, whose average monthly income is about $8000. The more money put into Dash, the more a Masternode will be paid, giving Masternodes funds to update hardware that can keep up with all of their functions.PrivateSend and InstantSendWith PrivateSend, Dash users can send anonymous transactions. When a user wants to PrivateSend, they will send an amount to a Masternode, whose job it will be to mask the transaction. This Masternode will never know who the sender or receiver is, and the transaction goes through without anything else needed from the sender. To read more about the technical details, check out Dash’s PrivateSend page.No one is using Bitcoin (high fees and long transaction times) to buy an espresso anymore. As the title suggests, InstantSend allows near-instant transactions to occur. These are sent to Masternodes, which verify the data. InstantSend is especially convenient in retail settings, such as coffee shops.Where Dash Is HeadedWith the current price spike, the Dash organization has an estimated $8 million monthly budget. Duffield has even spoken about possibly of scaling the block size to 1GB, which would allow Dash to scale and compete with companies like Visa and Mastercard.As Dash becomes more popular, more money will funnel into the Masternodes, who will be able to afford to run networks with a block size of 1GB. Back in June, before anyone knew how big of a problem Bitcoin’s scaling solution would be, Evan wrote: “Even Satoshi Nakamoto, founder of Bitcoin, seems to have simply assumed that advances in hardware and networking would solve the scalability problem for him. Dash is the first digital currency to come up with an answer to scalability that’s not based on technology that doesn’t yet, and might never, exist. Dash will be able to rival the likes of PayPal and VISA simply by using its existing infrastructure.”Coming off a stellar year of growth and business development, Dash seems posed for an even stronger 2018. The message of Dash is very simple: Fast Digital Cash.Posted In: Dash, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
625,CryptoSlate,MakerDAO Launches New Dai Stablecoin on the Ethereum Blockchain,Eliot Prince,1513652400.0,"MakerDAO announced the launch of their Dai stablecoin on the 18th of December after over two and a half years of development.Dai is a cryptocurrency that automatically reacts to emergent market conditions in order to stabilize its value against the major world currencies.What is the Dai?Dai is a new stablecoin that was developed to help design a new decentralised digital global economy.For those who are unfamiliar with the concept of stablecoins, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a fiat currency – such as the U.S. dollar. The most well-known stablecoin is of course Tether, which runs as a token on the Omni blockchain.During a boom time for digital currencies, the Dai creators said they were quick to understand the need for a fair, transparent and efficient stablecoin.MakerDAO hopes to offer traders a trustworthy asset-backed currency with low volatility towards major fiat currencies. The Dai launch on the Ethereum Mainnet represents one of the first fully decentralized stablecoins offered on the Ethereum blockchain.Upon the launch of the Dai, Head of Global Business Development for ConsenSys, Andrew Keys, noted the significance of stablecoins in a tweet:Stablecoins are the basis of financial instrumentation like hedging and leverage. Huge step forward for the Ethereum eco-system. https://t.co/NBqBUamebg— Andrew Keys (@ConsenSysAndrew) December 19, 2017The stability of Dai comes in direct relation to the US Dollar with 1 DAI equal to $1 USD. The currency is autonomously maintained through the use of smart contracts that adapt and respond to market dynamics.How does it work? Watch this short video (1:40):The Importance of DecentralizationDecentralization is often pinpointed as a major factor in a successful cryptocurrency. With many of the major players, including Bitcoin, coming under scrutiny in recent months, the MakerDAO team was keen to underline their operating protocols:“The essential stability property is continuously maintained through an autonomous system of smart contracts specifically designed to respond to market dynamics. No one, MakerDAO included, can alter the core mechanics of Dai, making it a safe and predictable form of money.”– MakerDAOEven MakerDAO can’t change the core mechanics of their cryptocurrency offering traders a secure and predictable option for holding funds.Why use a stablecoin?Crypto investors often convert to a stablecoin, such as Tether, to secure profits without having to exit to a fiat currency.Financial options including hedging, leveraging, longs and short generally require a third party trusted holder for contracts. Dai aims to change the game allowing traders to work in a similar fashion minus the central control. For example, it is now possible to long Ether by utilizing Dai’s decentralized nature.Users need Ether to act as collateral before creating and issuing Dai. Combining the Dai Explorer and the Metamask application makes it possible to quickly interact and securely move Ether into Dai for a less volatile hold.Those not fully versed in interacting with the Ethereum blockchain may experience a steep learning curve before feeling comfortable with the process of obtaining the new stablecoin.To create Dai, Ether must first be wrapped into a compliant token. After this, the Ether is shifted into an MKR token before Dai is be issued into an account. Funds will then be stored as Dai at a stable rate to the US Dollar. Owners then simply reverse the process to sell Dai back into wrapped Ether.Real world usageIt is still early for the Dai, so system still has a few bugs. A host of new developments continue to be expected on the decentralized stablecoin and despite a few teething problems, reports seem to be positive for the early adopters on Twitter.It took 7 Ethereum transactions and about $11 in fees to mint some @makerdao #dai. However, what came out is a decentralized stablecoin. Amazing effort.— Jake Brukhman (@jbrukh) December 19, 2017A fascinating experiment has begun.

626,CryptoSlate,Privacy Is Paramount: A Look Into Why Verge Has Been Surging,Dylan Dedi,1513642440.0,"John McAfee, founder of McAfee Antivirus and an outspoken crypto advocate, recently made this assertion: Privacy coins, otherwise known as coins that allow anonymous transactions, will be the future of cryptocurrency.I am inundated by people asking me for recommendations on cryptocurrencies. If you would use your heads you would figure out that the privacy coins (anonymous transactions) will have the greatest future. Coins like Monero (XMR), Verge (XVG), or Zcash (ZEC) cannot lose.— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) December 13, 2017This is a bold statement coming from someone who has been predicting Bitcoin would reach $1 million per coin by 2020. His support for Verge (XVG) is a part of the reason why it is up 427% over the past month.Verge has been one of the top gainers in 2017. Verge is up 19,937.74% since the beginning of the year.An Established Privacy CoinVerge is so obsessed with privacy that it calls its technical whitepaper a “Black Paper.” You can download it here.Verge (XVG) is first-and-foremost a privacy coin. It was originally launched in 2014 as DogeCoinDark. Its privacy functions include anonymous capabilities that exceed Zcash and Monero in their intuitiveness and end result.Verge uses the The Onion Router (TOR) network and Invisible Internet Project (i2P) to hide transaction addresses. Transactions are also quick — Simple Payment Verification (SPV) allows for transaction confirmation to drop to around 5 seconds.How exactly does Verge use TOR and I2P (Invisible Internet Project)? Both of these systems are integrated into Verge wallets, such as Electrum. This integration masks the user’s IP address. TOR facilitates this by sending data through a network containing 7000 relays, and I2P adds a second layer of privacy by acting as a tunneling service with p2p transactions.The Wraith ProtocolThe Wraith Protocol was announced in September 2017 and has been one of the attributing factors to its recent price surge. With the Wraith Protocol, there is a simple switch on the wallet that will allow users to turn privacy on or off. So, if transparency is needed, Wraith can be switched “off.”This sends the transaction to Verge’s public ledger. Turning it “on” sends the transaction to Verge’s private ledger. The transparency tool will allow merchants and everyday users to use it like any other currency. This is highly significant in that almost all privacy coins can only function as a privacy coin with either a public or a private ledger.While Wraith is not fully functioning yet, it will be deployed onto the live network in 2018.Verge Atomic SwapsVerge allows for atomic swaps will allow for decentralized exchanges (DEX) to function, eliminating the need for centralized third-party exchanges like Coinbase, Bittrex, Poloniex, Shapeshift, etc. It’s an instantaneous trade between coins that are on different blockchains, where trust is not needed because of smart contracts.Even more usefully, the Wraith Protocol can still be turned on, making Verge’s end of the atomic swap anonymous.P2P Bot PaymentsWant to send coins via text? Verge is already on it. Currently, XVG can be sent on Twitter, Telegram, and Discord. Platforms like Reddit and Slack are coming in the future. This all works via messenger bots.Here’s how it works with Telegram:Add @VergeX_Bot to your Telegram groupTo find out what your Telegram address is, write “!address” as a direct message to the bot.Go to your hardware wallet and send coins to this address.You can check balance with “!balance” to see if it’s been sent.Send coins to whoever is in the group with “!tip @(username).”More can be seen on the Verge website, including Twitter instructions. Bot technology will make for easier ways to send coins in the future.Verge Product RoadmapThe Verge development team has been very active at constantly revising their roadmaps, updating them several times per year. They have promised that the next roadmap update will come in Q1 2018.According to the roadmap, we should see these developments in Q1 2018:Finality on RSK smart contractsTOR and i2P Android walletCore wallet releaseMerchandise storeThus far, Verge has done an excellent job of keeping its promises in a timely manner.Verge had an absolutely stellar 2017, with its price up over 17,000% since the beginning of the year. With a powerful suite of features and privacy at the forefront, Verge is definitely one of the coins to keep on your radar heading into the new year.You can find Verge on most major exchanges including Bittrex, Binance, Changelly and Cryptopia.Check out our privacy coins list if you are interested in other cryptocurrencies similar to Verge.Posted In: Altcoins, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
627,CryptoSlate,TRON Price Doubles On News of Gifto Partnership,Nica San Juan,1513213320.0,"Virtual-gifting platform Gifto has recently partnered with TRON, the decentralized entertainment framework on the Ethereum blockchain. The partnership aims to leverage the technology behind TRON to allow for effective transaction facilitation.TRON and Gifto’s partnership announcement saw the price of TRON nearly double over the previous 24 hours. Subsequently, Gifto’s initial coin offering began earlier today and sold out in one minute.Monetizing Content CreationGifto was envisioned to be a self-governing and self-sustaining ecosystem for virtual gifts.Gifto, a product of Asia Innovation Group, is still in the early stages but seems set for an impressive future. Its launch was made by Uplive, a mobile device application that has more than 20 million users.There are currently at least 60,000 content creators on Uplive who are incentivized using virtual gifts.Gifto, in partnership with Uplive, will make it possible to create, buy, and exchange gifts across other content networks like Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.In comes TRON, a decentralized blockchain platform that aims to transform the existing content creation and ownership framework. It places the power back in the users’ hands by constructing a free global entertainment system on the blockchain. The platform’s users can therefore publish and retain ownership of content for free as well as control its distribution and access.This Ethereum-based protocol will be the first to implement high-speed, scaled micro-transactions in the first quarter of 2018. This is the technology that Gifto intends to use to its advantage in order to allow its millions of users to operate on the network without unnecessary hitches.Justin Sun’s Impressive Track RecordJustin Sun is the 26-year old founder of TRON.The founder of TRON is 26-year old Justin Sun, who has been in the cryptocurrency community since 2012 when he bought Bitcoin for the first time. In 2013, he joined Ripple as Greater China’s Chief Representative.Sun has been featured in Forbes Asia 30 Under 30 in 2015 and 2017. He was the only millennial student in the first classes of Jack Ma’s Hupan University for entrepreneurship in China.Sun’s vision for TRON is to make it a shared platform for different entertainment systems around the world. This, he says, will bring down the information barriers that stand in the way of effective interactions between apps. Content creators will no longer have to pay the high prices associated with distribution platforms such as Apple Store and Google Play.The price of TRON is up 261.03% over the past month. The value of TRON has risen dramatically on the news and it is currently ranked #21 on the crypto rankings by market cap.TRON Follows Pattern of News-Driven DemandCryptocurrencies, in general, have benefited greatly from announcing partnerships with each other over the past few weeks. A few notable examples:Stellar announced a partnership with IBM that saw its price nearly double over the previous monthNEM announced an official WeChat app for the Chinese messaging ecosystem that saw its price jump 141% over the previous 7 saysMonero announced partnerships with 45 celebrities to accept XMR that led its price to grow 138% over the previous monthPosted In: Tron, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
628,CryptoSlate,Project Coral Reef Aims to Increase Monero Adoption,Nica San Juan,1513053540.0,"Monero (XMR) recently announced that five new online stores and 45 celebrities will be accepting payments through a new initiative known as “Project Coral Reef.”Monero’s Project Coral ReefProject Coral Reef is the latest initiative on the platform which seeks to create awareness of the network and highlight its viability as a payment settlement system.Project Coral Reef is an initiative created by Naveen Jain and Riccardo Spagni to elevate the awareness and viability of using Monero in everyday consumer transactions. The project was funded by 180 anonymous contributors through a campaign on Monero’s Forum Funding System, a crowdfunding system that allows the Monero community to fund projects that have the potential to positively impact Monero, and by GloBee.Monero has been leveraging these advantages to draw in more stores and merchants to its platform for online purchases. Some of the names on the list of musicians include Mariah Carey, Backstreet Boys, Dolly Parton, G-Eazy, Sia, Marilyn Manson and Sia among others.This celebrity partnership project has seen the XMR coin rise to $300 as at press time, which is a 8% rise in price over the past 24 hours.A Brief History of MoneroRiccardo “fluffypony” Spagni is the lead maintainer of Monero.Monero was in fact established in 2014 with the aim of addressing the privacy loopholes on existing blockchain models.The network uses “ring signatures” to encrypt all transaction information. Ring signatures are digital signatures that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys.There is therefore no way for the public to tell the origin, amount or destination of funds in any transaction carried out on the network. However, users have the option to employ a view key to share this information with select viewers.The concept of “ring signatures” first came to light in the year 2001. The technology lends to a high level of fungibility on the network preventing vendors from rejecting coins with a suspicious history.Taking a Look at Monero In the MarketThis year has been incredible for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Bitcoin has enjoyed much of the limelight, hitting new highs in an unprecedented wave of growth. Some less popular but equally worthwhile innovations on the blockchain, such as Monero, have also managed to grab investor attention and post strong month-to-month gains.Monero is trading up 138% over the past month.After a spectacular year of growth, 2018 will be an exciting year for cryptocurrency and Monero is one of many projects worth keeping an eye on.Posted In: Monero, Altcoins, Privacy     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
629,CryptoSlate,NEM Back on the Radar After Price Surge and WeChat App Announcement,Nica San Juan,1512958200.0,"Having recently experienced a price surge brought on by news about the development of an app for the WeChat ecosystem, NEM (XEM) is riding high alongside other top-performing cryptos.The recent NEM price rise has seen it jump to the 10th position on the crypto rankings and generate strong interest within the community. At press time, the crypto was trading at $0.47 against the USD, which is a gain of more than 65% over the past week.The price of NEM (ticker: XEM) is up 81% over the past 3 months.What Exactly is NEM?NEM is an acronym for “New Economy Movement,” and it bills itself as a blockchain for “enterprise grade performance.”NEM is one of the oldest crypto assets on the market. The project first came into existence in 2014 and unlike most other tokens that are sold on ICOs, its XEM coins were mostly airdropped for free.With security being one of its strengths, NEM is built on a modular design that makes it more secure from DDOS attacks and hacks.For example, its blockchain employs a concept known as “Node Reputation System” to detect suspicious activity. This system is based on machine learning and uses the network nodes’ past normal behavior to identify a deviation and employ countermeasures to prevent attack. This framework is certain to inspire confidence among developers and is a contributing reason for its rising popularity.NEM also utilizes something it calls “Supernodes” to offer limitless scalability and transaction speeds. The model takes the payment aspects of the blockchain technology and applies them across other technological infrastructures.NEM also allows programming on its blockchain in any language of choice – making it very developer-friendly.Smart AssetsNEM has built a technology called the Smart Asset System – which allows one to build a wide variety of decentralized applications, such as tracking logistics, an ICO, document notarization, authentication services and much more.NEM’s modular Smart Asset system enables businesses to build an incredible variety of real world application uses. By using NEM’s built-in features to define Smart Assets and connect them together, one can represent almost any system of business transactions on the blockchain with minimal development.Is NEM’s Growth Sustainable?Chinese messaging app WeChat has over 980 million monthly active users.Despite a 6000% year-to-date growth, NEM had a volatile second half of the year. After achieving a record high of $0.29 USD in Q1 2017, NEM experienced a sharp correction that saw it plummet to $0.09 USD. Shortly after this, it again ascended to $0.34 USD and then again fell back to $0.20 USD. It has spent most of the year around this price range before the most recent rally.When the WeChat app was first announced, there was some confusion within the community about whether this was a partnership WeChat itself or they were simply developing an app. The official report is that it is not a partnership but instead the announcement of an app for the WeChat ecosystem.This confusion, combined with a sharp drop in trading volume ($400M to <$100M) led the price to fall from a high of $0.63 USD to a low of $0.33 USD on Sunday. Short-term trading aside, NEM may be able to ride the overall market tide for many months to come.Note: After the successful launch of Bitcoin futures on Sunday, the entire cryptocurrency market has rebounded and NEM is up 25%.Posted In: Altcoins, Enterprise     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
630,CryptoSlate,Stellar Lumens On An Upward Trajectory Following Partnership Announcements and ICO Platform,Nica San Juan,1512700080.0,"While many crypto enthusiasts have their eye on the top ten tokens in the charts, an unlikely player is making their way to the top. Stellar Lumens has in the past few days made an effort to separate from the altcoins pack and it seems to be headed for glory.The cryptocurrency charts are inherently discriminatory since there are over 1,000 different altcoins in the market at present. This makes it hard to keep tabs on each one and only the most outstanding ones get the general public’s attention. Well, the fortune is about to change for the Stellar Lumens token, Lumens (XLM) after its price has made a gradual rise from $0.028 to $0.15 in the span of one month.Stellar Lumens (XLM) is up 81% over the past month on promising news of partnerships from IBMWhat’s behind the spike?Stellar Lumens currently ranks #13 with a market cap of $2.4 billion.This price rally seems to have been triggered by the IBM partnership announcement with the startup. Since its inauguration, the platform has been handling limited payment transfers involving Fijian dollars and the British pound. But the IBM partnership is set to raise its bar to a much higher level, handling around seven different South Pacific fiat currencies.The best part about the IBM-Stellar partnership is that it showcases how public and private blockchains can work in tandem. IBM has in-house blockchain solutions that handle transaction clearing.But the public Stellar blockchain will be tasked with carrying out the settlement part of it. This process will use the Lumen to connect fiat currencies digitally and make conversions almost instant.The partnership has seen Stellar rise to the 13 position on the cryptocurrency chart. The most promising aspect of the current high trading volume on the network is the fact that its volume is spread across many different exchanges including Poloniex, Bittrex, Binance and Kraken. This makes it highly unlikely that it is experiencing a pump and dump and increases the chances of sustainability.The Stellar StoryJed McCaleb is an American programmer who was one of the co-founders of Ripple.Stellar was founded by one of the co-founders of the Ripple platform. It focuses its attention on developing markets and this might be one of the reasons for its slow ascent to fame.However, it offers a worthy approach by focusing its attention on the unbanked population. It also acts as a bridge connecting different currencies that do not operate on their own direct market.Another unique aspect that sets Stellar apart is the fact that it seeks to eliminate centralized intermediaries like currency exchange platforms on the blockchain. Its system incorporates a decentralized exchange system for both fiat and digital currency transactions.The platform also allows its users to create tokens making it a prime attraction for ICOs. In this regard it competes with Ethereum and offers an alternative to the security model of Ethereum.Ethereum uses a language referred to as Solidity that allows developers almost unlimited freedom when writing code. This has made it easy to deploy malicious code on the platform. Stellar limits this freedom and thus offers a safer model.These factors make it easy to understand why the network would appeal to investors. It offers lots of real world potential and attracts a section of the public that has yet to be fully exploited. Even though at the moment it only trades on 15 exchanges globally, its potential is likely to lure in more exchanges which will lead to sustained growth on the network.Posted In: Stellar, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
631,CryptoSlate,The Rise of IOTA – How It Got Here and Where It’s Going,Nica San Juan,1512457860.0,"The IOTA cryptocurrency was created to address the downfalls of the traditional blockchain model. It works using the Internet of Things, a network comprised mostly of household appliances, vehicles, and other items that can be operated using electronic sensors.As of early December 2017, IOTA is the fourth highest ranked cryptocurrency by market cap with $13.2 billion.The technology behind the Internet of Things makes it possible to integrate these devices into a computer-based framework.This makes it easy to access and control them remotely. It also eliminates the need for human monitoring over the items’ performance, which provides improved accuracy and lower operational costs.This basic framework enables the development of digital power plants, smart homes, and grids providing residences, businesses, and cities with intelligent infrastructural systems. According to analysts’ predictions, these networks will incorporate at least 30 billion items by the year 2020.The IOTA framework differs remarkably from the original blockchain framework in a number of ways. Here is an overview of the major differences:The TangleInstead of a blockchain, the IOTA network uses a new architecture referred to as a Directed Acyclic Graph. This is known as the Tangle and it sets the model apart from all others.Like most other cryptocurrency models, it has a distributed ledger, but this operates without blocks. There is no chain on the network and therefore no need for miners.The main innovation behind IOTA is the Tangle, a revolutionary new blockless distributed ledger which is scalable, lightweight and for the first time ever makes it possible to transfer value without any fees.Every single transaction forms a block on the network. Instead of being bundled in the blockchain model, each transaction is verified independently.Even though this uses a Proof of Work protocol, the level is so low that devices automatically execute the transaction.No New TokensAll of the tokens powering the network were created with its genesis transaction. This is why there is no mining on the network. It also provides lots of room for growth, as all the tokens that will ever be used on the network are already in the market. There is no risk of the increased supply that causes inflation, and the only way to go is up.Zero FeesThe fact that the model does not require miners means that there are no fees for processing or verifying transactions on the network.Infinite ScalabilityEvery platform built on the blockchain has a maximum capacity. As most of them expand they have to incorporate innovations to allow for scalability. But this will never be an issue for IOTA because every new transaction provides verification for two more transactions. This means that as more people adopt the model and transact on it, the scalability expands.Recent Price RiseThe IOTA token, MIOTA, recently experienced a remarkable surge of over 100% within a one-week period. The coin is currently holding the fifth position on the cryptocurrency charts with a market capitalization of $8.1 billion. It is trading upwards of $1 billion on a daily basis, meaning that the bullish trend is likely to hold constant for some time to come.The current price per MIOTA is $4.70. It recently usurped Ripple as the fourth highest cryptocurrency by market cap.New Partnership with MicrosoftThe model’s bright future is evident in the fact that it has recently made significant partnerships with some mainstream institutions. One of the most prominent of these is Microsoft; other major players in the economic field also resonate with the viability of its concept.“This next generation technology will accelerate the connected, intelligent world and go beyond blockchain that will foster innovation real world solutions, applications and pilots for our customers,” said Microsoft’s Omkar Naik in a statement published on the IOTA Foundation website.These partnerships are aimed at creating the first of its kind IoT-based data marketplace. This is a revolutionary move that will see the marketplace run entirely on a distributed ledger framework. This tamper-proof system will make it easier for organizations to share sensitive data and monetize it securely. The framework ensures immutability and provides a permanent record for all uploaded data.What the Future HoldsAs of Dec. 2017, IOTA’s Reddit community has over 48,000 subscribers.The cryptocurrency revolution took the world by storm. But sufficient time has passed to expose the flaws in the traditional blockchain model that runs these networks. IOTA has taken a bold leap to be one of the first models to offer a unique solution to these loopholes. When the old models are unable to adapt to change, there is inevitably a new player on the scene rising in the ranks to replace them.Integrating the Internet of Things into the most everyday operations is bound to offer increased efficacy, lower overhead costs, greater productivity, improved customer relations, and more technological advancements in related areas.The recent growth spurts in IOTA and the model’s innovative design are a good sign for the network. Its partnership with major organizations in different fields is a guarantee of consistent growth. And the fact that it rises above the traditional model gives it a major advantage over its competitors. IOTA is still a work in progress, but it holds every promise of a bright future.Posted In: IOTA, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
632,CryptoSlate,ARK Creates a Unique Business Entity,Bill DeLisle,1511933340.0,"It’s easy to reduce cryptocurrencies to the two leaders in the field: Bitcoin and Ethereum. After all, only one cryptocurrency has surpassed $10,000, and only one is developing a blockchain network that’s being explored by Microsoft, J.P. Morgan Chase, and BP.As of November 28, ARK’s current market cap is $325 million placing it at #30 in the CryptoSlate crypto rankings.However, the cryptocurrency market is an expansive arena that includes hundreds of different currencies that are serving a wide variety of purposes. They extend across many different blockchains, though some are more popular than others.As the cryptocurrency market matures, it’s interesting to consider how all of these different blockchains might work together and how these various cryptocurrencies can interact with one another. The answer seems to be ARK, a unique blockchain and digital token that’s connecting every other blockchain.There is no shortage of blockchain startups, so it’s unique to find one that’s as compelling as ARK. Having incorporated in France as a cooperative society, ARK is a more traditional investor experience in which every investor is allotted a vote on issues, so it is prioritizing community consensus along with technological innovation.A Little Bit of BackgroundARK launched as an ICO in 2016. Initially, the ICO failed to raise the capital that the group expected. It raised less than $1 million, but the team continued to develop the ARK platform. This reshaped the project and forced developers to streamline their focus on building far-reaching blockchain community.ARK has a vibrant Reddit community having just passed 11,000 subscribers.One of the primary hangups for blockchain startups is their legal standing as a company. By nature, the blockchain is an international endeavor that draws attention from an equally diverse audience. Therefore, developing a legal framework was the next significant challenge.After exploring several options, including non-profit status and offshore corporations, ARK decided to settled on incorporation in France as the best option for the project.After consulting international legal teams, ARK attained the designation of a General Interest Co-operative (SCIC) which means that all SCIC members are shareholders, and each shareholder is awarded one vote toward voting measures.ARK’s road to SCIC status wasn’t smooth, but the result is a highly ambitious company with the potential to make an outsized impact on the blockchain ecosystem.What They DoArk is the cryptocurrency of cryptocurrencies. Its goal is to create a platform that connects currencies and blockchains so that token holders can experience the unique, niche aspects of the crypto-ecosystem while also having a unified platform to execute smart contracts and other blockchain-based interactions.Utilizing already established components of blockchain technology, ARK connects blockchains and cryptocurrencies. They call this “smart bridge technology,” and it’s the connection piece that allows unique cryptocurrencies to blockchains to thrive in a unified community.ARK sees typically 98% of it’s daily volume from Bittrex and Binance.Undoubtedly, ARK has a compelling company narrative, but its desire and ability to establish connections between previously disparate blockchains is one of the most transformative measures to enter the crypto space this year.For the blockchain and crypto-economy to continue to thrive, these connections creative a cohesive network of blockchains and cryptocurrencies that are more applicable to the real-world and more usable for adopters.Where They Are GoingAs with all ICOs, there is a necessary assessment between the value of the digital currency and the capabilities of the system that it powers. In this respect, ARK’s token is doing better than its concrete implementation of blockchain connectivity.ARK has experienced tremendous growth in 2017 thanks to a thriving community and developer ecosystem.Its technical contributions continue to be a work in progress. Its technology is capable of connecting blockchains and cryptocurrencies, but the scope of its adoption is still to be determined. Moreover, ARK is a uniquely ambitious company because it has more than twenty clear priorities that are at different levels of development.ARK’s status as an SCIC is what sets it apart. It has already done the hard work of establishing legality, something that many blockchain startups are saving for another day. ARK’s plan is a good idea, and it is legally prepared and enthusiastically ready to make a significant attempt at altering the blockchain landscape.This is a promise that we often hear from new start-ups, but somehow ARK feels more like the mature young professional in a crowded room full of college students.Posted In: France, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
633,CryptoSlate,What’s Going on with NEO?,Eliot Prince,1511330400.0,"NEO is the latest altcoin to see a massive price gain in a volatile November cryptocurrency market.The cryptocurrency market is as volatile as ever, thanks in large part to the ‘real’ Bitcoin war. Most altcoins have seen a huge influx of investment as Bitcoin Cash spews its molten lava across the industry. NEO’s rumor mill has been teeming in recent days, making it the latest to benefit from investors seeking new profits.The price of NEO has surged from $26 to push through $40 on several occasions during mid-November. This is no surprise to many, with NEO widely-tipped as the altcoin to watch. Despite low prices, in recent months investors have been waiting for a price move driven by China.NEO recently experienced an all time high, pumped on rumors of a big announcement that China will allow ICOs again, but only under the NEO platform.Big News For NEOIt promises to be a big November for NEO as speculation grows on developments for the cryptocurrency. The price surged more than 15% with the news that Onchain is working with NEO for the Ontology Platform, a distributed trust network.NEO continues to gain strength and could become a strong competitor to the Ethereum blockchain thanks to the programming flexibility on offer.Rumors in the West are buzzing about what is going on in the East, specifically China. China’s ban on ICOs has invoked some pretty strong opinions (as government involvement in cryptocurrency always does). It is not a huge leap to believe that China may eventually lift the ban to allow companies to work with NEO, a Chinese blockchain.The founder of NEO, formerly known as AntShares, Da Hongfei, founded NEO in 2014.With 60% of the world’s crypto investors situated in China, a selection of investors sees this as a potential upswing possibility. If they are all forced to work with NEO for ICOs that could trigger huge demand.On the other hand, there are some worrying signs that NEO is much more centralized than previously thought.In fact, at the time of writing, there are only 13 nodes on the network, all of them handpicked and white-flagged by the developers. That’s a stunning control of a two-year-old crypto with a market cap of over two and a half billion dollars.Is this control being driven by the Chinese government? Possibly, but after doing a little digging it looks unlikely.A piece from Store of Value brings to the fore several worrying points, none more so than data suggesting no one in China even notices NEO. Buyers are surging from the West on the promise of a bright future. The article stunningly reveals the following:“More than 90% of NEO’s volume comes from Bittrex and Binance, two exchanges used mainly by Westerners.”If true it becomes quite an eye opener for anyone looking at NEO. But then what in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency world is not a speculative ‘promise of a bright future’? Even Bitcoin is an experiment for which we don’t know the outcome. So far there is no real-world, widespread use of cryptocurrency or blockchains. We don’t transact cryptos in day-to-day life or even store value. We are all gambling on a promise that this is the future.The close of 2017 should be interesting for NEO. How many strong ICOs will jump on board with them? It still remains to be seen whether China will begin allowing ICOs again, and if so, whether there will be a requirement to use NEO as the blockchain platform.  In the meantime, at the very least we should know in the next few days what big announcement the NEO team has in store for us.UpdateToday NEO issued a formal apology to the NEO community in response to the backlash about how they handled last Friday’s teaser “announcement of an announcement.” This caused many to speculate NEO would be announcing news of relaxed Chinese regulations, however this proved not to be the case.The announcement instead still focused on positive news such as a partnership with Microsoft China and a new public platform for distrivuted trust networks known as Ontology. Additionally, members from the largest community organization released a whitepaper for a decentralized exchange known as NEX. Exciting times are definitely in store for the NEO project and community.Posted In: Neo, China, Altcoins, Rumors     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
634,CryptoSlate,What’s going on with Bitcoin Cash?,Eliot Prince,1510891440.0,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been benefiting from the controversial Bitcoin (BTC) hard-fork cancellation a week before the scheduled SegWit2x update was due.Bitcoin Core is the reference client of Bitcoin. Initially, the software was published by Satoshi Nakamoto under the name Bitcoin, and later renamed Bitcoin Core to distinguish it from the network.After months of heated debate about how best to grow the largest cryptocurrency, leading developers released a statement explaining that if they continue their current SegWit2x plans it could be a “setback to Bitcoin’s growth.”A powerful alliance in the BTC community had initially planned to increase each transaction block size from 1MB to 2MB in order to speed up the network. The Bitcoin Core Development team and many others are welcoming the news, having voiced their opposition to the protocol change.The news was released via an announcement signed by 6 major names behind the proposal, including BitGo’s Mike Belshe, Xapo’s Wences Casares, Bitmain’s Jihan Wu, Bloq’s Jeff Garzik, Blockchain’s Peter Smith and Shapeshift’s Erik Voorhees.“Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to BTC’s growth. This was never the goal of SegWit2x.”There was widespread chatter with an air of celebration from the Bitcoin community. Those who care about the future growth of the cryptocurrency appear to be happy with the suspended plans. Creating a divide in the community had been putting the current iteration of BTC in jeopardy.Many were expecting a ‘bloodbath’ on November 16th costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Despite celebrations, frustration at the late u-turn is evident with many startups and organizations committing significant resources in preparing for the changes.The game-changing news had a significant effect on the BTC and BCH market prices. Sensationally, the BTC price pumped up to a new record high at nearly $7,850 before pulling back to the low $6000 and then rebounding again to all-time highs.Bitcoin’s rollercoaster prices over the past month have caused people to speculate Bitcoin Cash may become the “true” Bitcoin one day.Money has been flowing into BTC’s rival cryptocurrency, BCH, which moved from around $600 up to $2500 in a short period. The BCH price seems to be stabilizing at around $1200 as loud, anti-BTC voices in the industry proclaim BCH as the true representation of Satoshi Nakamoto’s initial vision.Bitcoin Cash’s price increase over the past month has surprised speculators in the cryptocurrency space.Two uncompromising sides to the argument still exist despite the SegWit2x cancellation. BCH backers want to see the fall of the original BTC.Naturally, BTC holders want to see their currency continue as king due to large investment commitments.Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The fork occurred on August 1, 2017.There are lots of theories behind the pump of BCH, which has seen its market cap push past the likes of Ethereum and Litecoin. It has been a nervy time for the whole community, with BTC coming under attack. The network has been repeatedly spammed by microtransactions which are weighing it down. Transaction times and fees have skyrocketed, and the price even slid below the $6000 mark at times.Miners have been moving over to BCH as it becomes more profitable. It was reported that 60% of hashing power has moved to BCH during the power struggle, contributing to BTC latency.The ‘real Bitcoin argument’ is more fierce than ever, and BCH believers are calling for the death of BTC. Today’s price, however, seems to suggest that demise is unlikely.Posted In: Bitcoin Cash, Altcoins     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
635,CryptoSlate,The Battle for Privacy: Monero vs. Zcash,Bill DeLisle,1507167960.0,"Recent headlines about significant data breaches at major companies have returned our attention to privacy and our right to be anonymous on the Internet.This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo’s hack, which was initially announced in 2016, was actually three times bigger than initially thought, and it totals up to 3 billion Yahoo users.The CEO of Equifax, Richard Smith, is retiring from the credit reporting bureau with a pay day worth as much as $90 million—or roughly 63 cents for every customer whose data was potentially exposed in its recent security breach.Moreover, Equifax updated its assessment from a previous data breach and announced that an additional 2.5 million users were affected, which, according to CBS News, “brings the total number of Americans whose data was exposed to 145.5 million people.”All of this attention leaves people searching for new solutions to this escalating problem, and the cryptocurrencies powered by blockchain technology offer a solution that is worth investigating.Cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining mindshare and notoriety.  When reports surfaced this week that Goldman Sachs is considering developing the personnel and infrastructure to trade cryptocurrencies, the attention was mostly on Bitcoin and Ethereum.However, blockchain technology, the accounting and infrastructure backbone of Bitcoin and Ethereum, allows for the development of nuanced coins that attend to specific needs and desires.Many developers and financial entrepreneurs are capitalizing on this capability by launching initial coin offerings that are raising serious start-up money and are launching new cryptocurrencies. In a primer on initial coin offers, The Wall Street Journal writes that:“In the third quarter of 2017, 105 initial coin offerings raised $1.32 billion from eager investors.”Of these currencies, some are specifically specializing in privacy, and, to different degrees, they appear to be succeeding. The two major privacy coins Zcash and Monero are joined by several, less-well-known currencies, and they are creating avenues by which people can achieve privacy in their online purchases and transactions.ZcashZcash is one of the newest arrivals in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency market. First launched in 2016, Zcash builds on the promise of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies to create a functional digital currency that enhances privacy and security through end-to-end encryption that is accessible by using zero knowledge proofs.Known as zk-SNARK and established by the Zcash development team, this protocol allows “the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved.”Zcash empowers users to operate privately or to complete public payments smooth and transparent way.Zcash payments are published on a public blockchain, but users are able to use an optional privacy feature to conceal the sender, recipient, and amount being transacted. Like Bitcoin, Zcash has a fixed total supply of 21 million units.While Zcash is certainly pushing innovation, there are concerns about its security and cryptography standards. In a 2016 blog post, a Bitcoin developer expressed concerns about the viability of zk-SNARK.Therefore, as Zcash attempts to scale, it will need to continually address security concerns even as it proliferates its platform.Zcash is often confused with the less popular but still emerging Zcoin. Both currencies rely on zero knowledge proofs, but according to ZCoin, “There is otherwise no relation between the two projects.”However, the fact that there are multiple cryptocurrencies striving to develop the same security standards should mean that the standard will mature more quickly and will help further proliferate Zcash and others that embrace the zero knowledge proof approach to cryptography.MoneroFunctioning in a similar capacity as Bitcoin, Monero differentiates itself primarily through this privacy component. In a profile on the currency, Wired writes that Monero is designed “to be fully anonymous and virtually untraceable.”Monero primarily pursues user privacy in two ways: by concealing account balances and by mixing transactions.When working with the blockchain, everyone has a public address, and with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, transactions are associated with that public address. Monero explains that, when sending funds using Bitcoin, “You announce to the entire Bitcoin network that the funds that you own now belong to the recipient’s public address.Everyone can see.”In contrast, while Monero users have a public blockchain address, their funds are not associated with that address. To accomplish this, Monero uses a temporary public address to which transactions are sent and received by a temporary, randomly created address.Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency created in April 2014 that focuses on privacy, decentralization and scalability that runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD.As a result, there is no public record of transactions, so users can maintain privacy regarding their financial holdings. Of course, if they want to, account holders can share their balance information with anyone by creating a “secret view key,” which allows key recipients to view the account holder’s balance and transactions.In addition to concealing users account balances, Monero masks their transactions using a technique known as “ring signatures.” CoinDesk helpfully explains this concept as a process that combines “a user’s account keys with public keys obtained from Monero’s blockchain to create a ‘ring’ of possible signers.”This means that transactions remain anonymous because they are indistinguishable from one another. In this way, Monero embraces privacy protection at the account and transactional level.Monero can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges including Poloniex, Bitfinex, and Kraken. While it has experienced some wild price fluctuations in the past 24 months, Monero has proven to be a viable privacy currency that, in many ways, furthers the purposes of Bitcoin.  At this point, Monero’s biggest concern is scalability and efficiency.Developing these capabilities are its stated priority for 2018 and beyond, and their effectiveness in addressing these concerns will determine much of its viability in the future.Closing ThoughtsPrivacy coins are often closely associated with the worst parts of the Internet in general and cryptocurrencies in particular. It’s argued that they enable cybercrime, the dark web, and real-world criminal behavior.This argument isn’t completely without merit, but criminality isn’t the intended purpose nor is it the sole use case for privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies.As recent headlines have demonstrated, privacy is a valuable commodity, and cryptocurrencies that can effectively establish scalability and practicality may find that they are leading the pack of privacy endeavors.ZcashMoneroDevelopers Zcash FoundationThe Monero Project World WideLaunch20162014 Blockchain ProtocolZero Knowledge ProofCryptoNoteToken Supply21 million18.3 millionAccepted LanguagesEnglishEnglishConsensus Zk-snarkCryptoNoteSpeed6 TPS1,600 TPSReddit Followers5,95327,971Market Cap.

636,CryptoSlate,Tokenized Real Estate Ownership: Propy vs. REAL,Wim Olivier,1506412860.0,"“When faced with disruptive technologies, the most effective companies thrive by incorporating them into the way they do business.”…and in steps Blockchain, the perfect case in point, also currently the hottest buzzword in tech. Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin – the pioneer of cryptocurrencies – to the World in 2009; little did we anticipate the revolutionary flow-on effects of its blockchain “spinal cord”.Today, entities across the planet are scrambling to leverage the benefits of blockchain. Please continue reading to see how two trailblazing enterprises within the property industry, Propy and REAL, are embracing this exciting opportunity.What are the objectives of Propy and REAL?PropyPropy describe themselves as a “global property store with decentralized title registry”. They aim to simplify international real estate transactions by digitizing the key processes, contractual and ownership formalities.Although property has been a top preserver of wealth and also one of the choice income-generators through the ages, the largest chunk of Earthlings are excluded – for investment purposes – from participating in this $217 trillion asset class.      One major barrier to entry is the absence of a truly borderless, global infrastructure that facilitates swift processes and opens up cross-border investment opportunities to regular folk around the Globe.      Tech Crunch founder Michael Arrington is one of the advisors to Propy.Propy’s Ethereum-based blockchain platform allows users anywhere to view properties for sale, make real estate purchases online by means of smart contracts, and pay and receive registration of ownership – all in one, fast, secure and convenient chain of digital processes.      Initially, the Platform aligns itself with existing government or state protocols and legalities surrounding property transactions, the pilot project being in California.      Ultimately, though, the Propy Registry aims to be an approved “Authority” in its own right. Put simply, once your real estate transaction and ownership is registered with Propy, it will be signed and sealed as far as the law goes, with no further requirements.REALREAL is an acronym for Real Estate Asset Ledger. Their business concept hinges on the crowdfunding model, where collective funds are invested in qualifying real estate assets; participants share in rental income plus the increases in property values which accrue to their chosen investment portfolios.The crowdfunding-method of property investment is currently valued at +$3.5 billion globally, forecasted to exceed $300 billion by the year 2025.A major hurdle for growth in real estate crowdfunding is the inability of international investors to participate; cumbersome cross-border processes and overseas money-transfer difficulties are some of the major barriers.REAL aim to overcome those hindrances, thereby stimulating participation trends. Their “Ethereum Smart-Contracts governed ecosystem,” as they fondly refer to it, makes the experience truly borderless.  Digitized property assets, contracts, and payments can be moved and exchanged globally on their blockchain in rapid and secure fashion.How does it work?PropyIn a nutshell, the real estate purchase process on the Propy platform looks like this:Sellers list and buyers find properties in Propy’s online store (Propy DApp); select and use your native language.Buyer submits an offer of purchase via smart contract, which requires a Propy token (PRO) to trigger execution.Seller accepts the offer by digital signature of the smart contract.The smart contract auto-requests payment from the buyer.The buyer pays in cryptocurrency which triggers auto-registration of the new ownership with Propy Registry.PRO tokens were obtainable during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO), or may now be purchased on a traded exchange.REALThe key process flows within the REAL Platform are as follows:The Platform purchases a selected investment property and transports it into their blockchain system by means of a smart contract, called a REAL Property Contract (RPC).The RPC is subdivided into fractions or “internal tokens” called REAL Property Participations (RPP) and offered for sale on the Platform.Investors purchase RPPs and pay with REAL tokens.The rental income derived from the specific property is divided between the RPPs, and owners are paid out in Ethereum (Ether) cryptocurrency on a monthly basis.If an investment property is sold, RPP owners receive the profit portion of the sale in Ether and the principal (original purchase price of the property) back in REAL tokens.Owners can cash out (sell) their RPPs on the Platform and get paid in Ether.Investors may purchase REAL tokens during the ICO or at a traded exchange afterwards. What’s their backstory, roadmap & ICO details?PropyPropy is the brainchild of Oxford University alma mater, Natalia Karayaneva (CEO) and Eva Otanke, both hailing from successful careers in real estate, business development, planning & sustainability. They are supported by a team of 10 colleagues and 7 advisors, covering all major business & technical disciplines.Propy is about halfway through its development roadmap – figure above – which started in Sep 2016 and is scheduled for completion in 2020.Propy issued 100 million PRO tokens at $1 each. PRO is classed as a utility token, based on the Ethereum ERC20 standard; this means that they can be held in any Ether-compatible crypto wallet and can also be traded on open exchanges.The crowdsale opening date for PRO was 15 Aug 2017 and it ended on 15 Sep 2017; Propy raised $15 million from 6,597 participants. Since sale date, PRO has been trading on the LiveCoin exchange at an average of $0.41, the latest (25 Sep) being $0.60.RealREAL is incorporated in Singapore as a private company, Real Estate Asset Ledger Pte. Ltd. It was founded by Enrique Dubois (CEO) and Bernardo Hernandez. Between them, they have a strong, online-startup track record and held executive positions at Yahoo, Google and top venture capital firms in Europe. A team of 4 executive colleagues support them, as do 6 advisors across the spectrum of commerce, tech and engineering.The REAL roadmap – figure above – consists of 3 distinctive phases: development, deployment & growth. They have recently completed the first part of the journey and are now in the second phase, deployment.REAL put up for sale 25-50 million Soft Cap & Hard/Security Cap REAL tokens; the price is 1 Ether (ETH) for 220 REAL tokens.Their ICO started on 31 Aug 2017 and ends on 30 Sep 2017. As of date (25 Sep), REAL token sales total to $10.3 million.What’s ahead?The value propositions of both Propy and REAL are providing the answers to significant challenges within the global real estate industry. Both enterprises aim to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology to achieve their goals.Global real estate value was recently estimated at $217 trillion.Essentially, Propy wants to streamline the global property purchase process, while REAL focuses more on the affordability aspect by offering fractional-ownership and crowdfunded real estate investment opportunities. The overall outcome that both are hoping for, however, is identical; to bring property – as an investment asset class – within the reach of regular folk, wherever they may find themselves in the financial world.Propy’s future journey might be unsure. A large portion of its success hinges on future legislation trends in terms of property processes; their whitepaper acknowledges this fact. Since trading on the open market (mid-Sep), the PRO token has lost 40% of its value. Perhaps this is an indication of market uncertainty on the legislation issue? Only time will tell.REAL will be trading on open exchanges from October 2017. If we look past the imminent “going-to-market jitters,” industry forecasts for global real estate support the REAL token to do well. Property heavyweight Colliers International believes that the next 12 months’ global growth will exceed 11%. They further state that +85% of global survey respondents are looking to make cross-border investments.In conclusion, REAL may be enjoying the benefits of a macroeconomic tailwind in the foreseeable future, boosting the value and growth of their token. Propy, on the other hand, is likely to face the headwinds of uncertainty while they await key developments in the legislative space. Bureaucracy is known to move slowly; positive news, if or when it comes, will undoubtedly have a bullish impact on the PRO token. Unfortunately, the flipside might also come true.Posted In: Altcoins, Analysis     Advertise Here or Hide Ads "
