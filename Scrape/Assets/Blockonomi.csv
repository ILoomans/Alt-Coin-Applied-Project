0,Blockonomi,10 Promising New Ethereum Projects That Are Here to Stay,William M. Peaster,1594625094.0,"In recent years, the Ethereum ecosystem has bloomed in multiple directions — that much is clear.Importantly, this blooming has allowed the smart contract platform to become an early king of the hill regarding DeFi, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, Layer-2 blockchain scaling solutions, non-fungible tokens, and more.The advance of these innovations has led to something of a metaphorical gravity well, in which builders keep flocking to Ethereum because it’s become the premier platform for these advanced blockchain possibilities.With that said, promising new Ethereum-based projects continue springing up at a rapid pace these days, making it dizzying at times to try and keep up with all the notable efforts. Interested in playing some catch-up? Here’s 10 newer Ethereum projects you can put on your radar — they’ve the potential to be around for years to come.mStableContents1 mStable2 Balancer3 Loopring Pay4 Matcha5 UMA’s Synths6 renBTC7 Omen8 DeversiFi9 InfiNFT10 NFTfi11 ConclusionmStable is a meta-assets protocol focused on stablecoins that launched in late May 2020. The system is meant to address fragmentation and a lack of native yield opportunities in the stablecoin ecosystem.Among the project’s first releases was mUSD, a meta-stablecoin underpinned by other stablecoins like DAI, USDC, TUSD, and USDT. This means you can mint or redeem mUSD on a 1:1 ratio with any of its constituent stablecoins. Additionally, mUSD also generates yield via mStable swap fees and via lending underlying assets through Aave and Compound.BalancerHaving arrived on the Ethereum mainnet this spring, Balancer is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol that lets users open up customizable liquidity pools. Popular AMM Uniswap currently only supports two-token pools with a 1:1 weighting of assets, while Balancer pools can support up to eight tokens with arbitrary weightings.This model gives liquidity providers more flexibility with how they can earn fees using their idle Ethereum-based tokens. Moreover, Balancer has started a liquidity mining campaign that rewards Balancer LPs with BAL governance tokens in order to bootstrap the protocol.Loopring PayAs Ethereum has grown increasingly popular, the platform needs Layer-2 scaling solutions more than ever to handle the growing demand. That’s where Loopring Pay comes in.Built by the Loopring team, Loopring Pay allows users to send free ETH and ERC20 transactions in instantaneous fashion, and it’s available to use today. The new service is built on zkRollups tech, a Layer-2 scaling innovation that stores data on-chain but handles computation off-chain with zero-knowledge validity proofs. These rollups are among Ethereum’s most promising scaling solutions, and Loopring Pay shows what they can do in the here and now.MatchaMatcha is a decentralized exchange built by the creators of the 0x Protocol project and underpinned by 0x’s liquidity aggregator infrastructure.Launched in June 2020, Matcha goes all-in on user-friendliness and sensible design. Additionally, the DEX uses 0x Mesh tech in combination with other liquidity sources like Kyber Network and Uniswap to offer optimized, best-price trades. The DEX sector has already been one of Ethereum’s biggest stars to date, and consumer-friendly platforms like Matcha have the potential to keep that dynamic going strong well into the future.UMA’s SynthsUMA is a protocol for creating global and decentralized financial markets using synthetic assets. This year, the UMA team launched its first synthetic assets, including a priceless ETHBTC token that tracks the ETH/BTC price ratio. The token is priceless because its smart contract doesn’t rely on an on-chain price feed from an oracle but rather on a reference index.A UMA token minting interface was also just released, which allows users to create their own synthetic tokens, deposit and withdrawal collateral, redeem tokens, and easily track information about already deployed synths. These synthetic assets open up all kinds of new trading possibilities in the Ethereum ecosystem.renBTCTokenized bitcoin efforts are gaining traction around Ethereum, but the ERC20 BTC sector has been dominated so far by more centralized efforts like WBTC, whose underlying bitcoin funds are custodied with BitGo.That said, there’s been increasing calls for tokenized bitcoin projects that are trustless and non-custodial, and the Ren team have answered that call with renBTC. Using the RenVM network, users can mint renBTC on a 1:1 basis using actual BTC. The upside is that this tokenized bitcoin can be put to profitable use in Ethereum’s rising DeFi projects, like via serving as a Uniswap liquidity provider.OmenOmen is a decentralized predictions market platform spearheaded by Gnosis’s DXdao group. The dApp lets anyone create prediction markets for any questions they’d like using customizable parameters.Whereas other blockchain prediction projects have typically relied on conventional orderbooks, Omen facilitates liquidity using an automated market maker (AMM) system that matches trades in a manner akin to Uniswap. Moreover, Omen’s creators have explicitly designed the platform to be modular and open so that it can be extended organically as time goes on. The project’s reliance on external oracles is also a point of contrast from its main peer Augur, which has developed its own in-house oracle.DeversiFiLast month, the DeversiFi team launched DeversiFi 2.0, which is a “high-speed, self-custodial exchange” that preserves users’ privacy and can facilitate more than 9,000 Ethereum transactions per second.The new exchange is powered by StarkWare’s Validium tech, which is a Layer-2 scaling solution that handles data storage off-chain while dealing with computation via zero-knowledge proofs. Validium joins zkRollups, Optimistic Rollups, and Plasma as being very promising scaling advancements for Ethereum, and DeversiFi is putting Validium, the newest of these advancements, front and center for the good of users everywhere. If DeversiFi 2.0 gains traction, look for more projects to embrace Validium.InfiNFTInfiNFT is a new token minting platform that lets users mint NFTs whose metadata in maintained completely on-chain, and here on-chain equals more verifiable, secure, and transparent.The NFT sector is picking up lately, so it’s become increasingly important to consider how to maintain NFTs for posterity. InfiNFT tackles this matter head on by minting tokens using a combination of Ethereum, the Arweave blockchain, and the IPFS decentralized storage solution. This tech trifecta allows minters to rest easy knowing their NFTs will be secure indefinitely without having to go back and manually pin files to IPFS later.NFTfiSpeaking of the rise of the NFT sector, NFTfi is a streamlined marketplace for loans that use NFTs, like CryptoKitties or beyond, as collateral. This allows NFT collectors to borrow money against their idle digital collectibles and lenders to provide liquidity to these borrowers, with the underlying NFTs serving as payments in the case of any defaults. To this end, NFTfi is an interesting new project at the crossroads of DeFi and NFTs, and it has the potential to generate more attention, activity, and value around NFTs accordingly.Conclusion2020 has been a bustling year for Ethereum, and a big part of the reason why is because so many promising new projects built on Ethereum like the ones discussed above have been shipping out powerful products and platforms in recent months.At this point, the momentum is tangible; Ethereum’s network effect is growing, and as things stand right now, the platform’s ecosystem is vastly ahead of any so-called Ethereum killers.The grand question for now, then, is whether this momentum will continue and whether the pace of development around the Ethereum space stays high enough to keep sucking in activity. If so, then Ethereum’s constellation of stars is only just beginning.    3,240"
1,Blockonomi,BitTorrent &  µTorrent Enable Support for Binance Stablecoin BUSD,Osato Avan-Nomayo,1594371300.0,"BUSD — Binance’s USD stablecoin is now the latest crypto payment option added to the BitTorrent and µTorrent platforms. The move now sees the popular peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing service supporting six cryptocurrency tokens.Tron CEO, Justin CEO, acquired BitTorrent back in June 2018 triggering the platform’s pivot towards the crypto and blockchain space. P2P file sharing and permissionless value transfers share similar philosophies with the former being one of the markets primed for greater blockchain adoption and utilization.Pay for Torrent Subscription with BUSDAccording to a press release issued shared with Blockonomi, customers of the P2P file-sharing giant can now use BUSD for subscription payments on the platform. This service also extends to µTorrent Pro accounts.The addition of BUSD as a payment means comes as a result of a partnership with crypto gateway CoinPayments.net. BUSD is the first stablecoin to be accepted on the BitTorrent platform and joins other tokens like Tron (TRX), Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC), BitTorrent Coin (BTT), and OKEx coin (OKB).Commenting on the addition of BUSD as an accepted payment means on BitTorrent, Binance Chief Compliance Officer, Samuel Lim remarked:“We are thrilled to work with BitTorrent to offer BUSD, a NYDFS regulated stablecoin as one of the main payment options for purchasing Classic Pro. BUSD continues to grow in use cases and adoption within the industry. Holding stable value and built for convenient global transfers, stablecoins like BUSD will become the preferred choice of payments in the near future.”Apart from enabling BUSD as a payment means on its platform, BitTorrent also announced the replacement of BNB (ERC20) with BNB (BEP2). With CryptoPayments.net adopting the Binance chain, choosing the more liquid BEP2 version of the BNB token offers greater payment efficiency than its ERC20 counterpart.BUSD payments can be used to subscribe for BitTorrent and µTorrent classic including ad-free and VPN features. Subscription to Pro offers customer support, malware protection, and file conversion among other add-ons.BitTorrent Exploring Greater Interface with Crypto and BlockchainSince Sun’s BitTorrent acquisition, the P2P file sharing service has been increasingly interfacing with crypto and blockchain technology. BTT; BitTorrent’s native token which is TRX-based opened up crypto adoption to the platform’s 100 million users.Such was the anticipation of the token sale event that it raised $7.2M in 15 minutes. Back in January 2019, Blockonomi reported that the Tron blockchain was becoming more appealing due to the influx of user adoption from the BitTorrent ecosystem.Commenting on the addition of BUSD as a payment means, the Tron CEO stated:“Today we are pleased to accept BUSD as another digital payment option for Classic Pro for both BitTorrent and µTorrent users. By using BUSD or our other supported cryptocurrencies, millions of customers can unlock powerful features such as malware protection from our popular desktop torrent clients.”Indeed, P2P file sharing is a core aspect of the decentralized content space, one that provides an alternative to the censorship of centralized platforms. The likes of YouTube and Facebook routinely de-platform users based on political or social bias.Apart from censorship resistance, decentralized content sharing also holds the promise of creating an architecture for creators. In the mainstream space, advertisers enjoy the bulk of the proceeds from digital content with little going to users who develop these unique ideas. Decentralized content distribution could provide the framework for data monetization on behalf of creators.    1,622"
2,Blockonomi,Educational Resources for Bitcoin: Complete Guide,Brian Curran,1594361595.0,"A common thread among all emergent technologies is that there numerous misconceptions, general confusion, and many times, outright dismissiveness of the particular technology.While that is to be expected for most young technological innovations, it is striking in its gravity among Bitcoin’s critics and people who even still tout ‘blockchain, not Bitcoin.’Historically, the rise of new technology — such as the Internet — presents unique challenges in helping people to overcome the barrier to understanding precisely what it is, as well as its potential. This is mainly because such technologies are unprecedented, and access to information was much less accessible before the modern web.However, with Bitcoin, it’s different. People now have access to the most open and wide-ranging repository of information in history (i.e., the Internet) and sagacious analysis of the origins of money.Despite the consistently increasing volumes of metrics, analysis, and general information on Bitcoin and its underlying technologies, the problem of onboarding more people is still evident.People may disagree with the underlying value proposition of Bitcoin, but it is continually frustrating when the arguments against it draw from a place of ignorance about basic concepts within the technology and broader monetary perspective of the legacy cryptocurrency.Conversely, for people seeking more resources on Bitcoin, it can seem like a daunting task. Varied information is dispersed across the Internet, the technology is complicated, the notion of social consensus abstract, and placing Bitcoin in the context of the history of money is bizarre for people who just learned that fiat money is a relatively new phenomenon.Curated resource lists are hard to find many times, so we decided to provide a directory of some of the best resources for learning about Bitcoin, its technology, and social/economic impact.We have created our own guide to Bitcoin here at Blockonomi, so use that as a starting point.It is by no means a comprehensive list, and there will assuredly be quality content left out, but we hope it can be a start on the journey towards greater knowledge about Bitcoin.Bitcoin BooksContents1 Bitcoin Books2 Bitcoin Blogs3 Bitcoin Online Courses and Resource/Metrics Repositories4 Statistical Charts, Network Charts, and Block Explorers5 ConclusionBooks are often the best way to grasp the broader concept of a complex topic before diving into the details, and fortunately, some authors have furnished excellent works to help onboard people interested in the Bitcoin ecosystem.The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking — By Saifedean Ammous Saifedean Ammous’ work is a comprehensive overview of how variants of money have developed dating back to the Yapese Rai Stones. By placing emphasis on specific characteristics of sound money and its effect on social and economic developments, Ammous provides a compelling narrative that places Bitcoin within the context of humanity’s perception of money.Mastering Bitcoin: Programming The Open Blockchain — By Andreas Antonopoulos Quite possibly the best spokesman for Bitcoin, Antonopoulos is one of the leading proponents for the legacy cryptocurrency, and his first book helped to inspire many people to join the Bitcoin community. While more technically focused than Ammous’ work, Mastering Bitcoin unveils some of the most profound design features and implications of Bitcoin and is a must-read for anyone looking to learn more.The Internet of Money (Volumes 1 & 2) — By Andreas Antonopoulos The next two works by Antonopoulos are derived from his many lectures, presentations, and public events from around the world where he has strived to promote and educate people about Bitcoin. Through a series of essays, The Internet of Money contextualizes the ‘why’ of Bitcoin and is an outstanding beginning for people looking for a broader, and briefer, overview of the cryptocurrency.Programming Bitcoin: Learn How To Program Bitcoin From Scratch — By Jimmy Song Recently released and developer-oriented, Song’s book focuses on teaching Python developers how to build a Bitcoin library from scratch. His book elucidates the more complex technical components of Bitcoin to developers (i.e., Bitcoin’s Script language), and is the most comprehensive guide to programming Bitcoin to date.Bitcoin Money: A Tale of Bitville Discovering Good Money — By Michael Caras Targeted towards children, Caras’ book takes the complex topics of Bitcoin and the economics behind it and conveys the content in a way that is digestible and valuable to children, and even adults.Essays on Bitcoin — Compiled by John Gleeson Essays on Bitcoin is a free e-book that is comprised of a series of essays from many prominent Bitcoin community members and their takes on the original cryptocurrency.Bitcoin BlogsThere are some incredible blog series out there for people to follow that bring unique takes and analysis to the many components of Bitcoin that are often overlooked.From data insights to abstract takes on the social impact of Bitcoin, blog series can become one of the most intuitive ways to gather relevant perspectives on the consistently evolving Bitcoin.The Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi NakamotoNick Szabo — The Unenumerated — Speaks for itself.Paul Sztorc — Truthcoin — Insightful and comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.Satoshi Nakamoto Institute — The Complete Writings of SatoshiSatoshi Nakamoto Institute — Literature SectionBitMEX Research — The best industry research in the space.Bitcoin Tech Talk — Medium publication featuring a variety of authors and analysis — NewsletterVijay Boyapati — The Bullish Case for BitcoinJimmy Song — Bitcoin Educator and Developer.Jameson Lopp — Bitcoin Programmer and CTO at Casa.Willy Woo — Cryptocurrency investment and trading metrics analysis.Nic Carter — Partner at Castle Island Ventures with insightful analysis of Bitcoin.Hasu — Independent cryptocurrency researcher on multiple aspects of Bitcoin and crypto industry.BitFury Research — Comprehensive and insightful industry analysis.Tuur Demeester — Excellent economics analysis of Bitcoin.Elaine Ou — Elaine’s Idle Mind — Compelling cryptocurrency analysis among broader topics.Uncommon Core — A dual blog by Hasu and Su Zhu (CEO of Three Arrows Capital).Blockstream Blog — A leading Bitcoin development company with some fascinating technology products.Bitcoin Online Courses and Resource/Metrics RepositoriesOnline courses are a powerful discovery for the hungry mind in the digital era. Classes and resources on Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto are becoming increasingly prevalent and offer some of the most well-defined pathways for learning more about Bitcoin.Jameson Lopp’s Bitcoin Information and Resources — Likely the most comprehensive Bitcoin resource list available.Satoshi Nakamoto Institute — Various resources on Bitcoin’s history, design, literature, and more.Blockchain Transparency Institute — A must for new investors looking to avoid wash trading and bad exchanges.Coursera — Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies — Follows Princeton Book on Bitcoin.Udemy — Series of Bitcoin videos and lectures.Blockchain at Berkeley — edX Courses for Bitcoin and blockchain technology.Khan Academy — Bitcoin courses and video lectures.Buidl Bootcamp — Developer courses for Bitcoin (in Python) by Justin Moon.Bitcoin for Beginners — Andreas Antonopoulos YouTube series.Bitcoin Designed — Design resources and infographics for Bitcoin.Statistical Charts, Network Charts, and Block ExplorersOnce you have a firm grasp on the overarching concept of Bitcoin and how it functions, metrics websites and open-source analytics tools can become exceptionally useful for understanding the inner workings of a public blockchain.Many of the below websites are powerful mediums for evaluating real-time data (i.e., mining difficulty, transaction volume, etc.) that can be practical for a variety of applications.Coinmetrics — Excellent data charts, graphs, insights, and analysis.Messari/OnChainFX — Everything from crypto news to analysis and metrics.BitcoinVisuals — In-depth Bitcoin blockchain and Lightning Network metrics.BitcoinWisdom — Excellent charts and data for Bitcoin’s mining and difficulty.Blockhain.com — Custodial wallet service with comprehensive charts and on-chain metrics for Bitocin.P2SH — Transaction and network metrics for Bitcoin.Nomics — Cryptocurrency resources and market data.CoinDance — Comprehensive metrics and network statistics on Bitcoin — includes interesting information on LocalBitcoins in various geographical regions as well.ConclusionObviously, this is not a comprehensive list of all the quality resources available on Bitcoin. There are more categories, including podcasts, conferences, video presentations, the Bitcoin subreddit, merchant directories, professional trading resources, cryptoeconomics literature, developer tools, wiki guides, and much more. Bitcoin spawned an entire industry, and it is promising to know that its abundance of resources is continually expanding.We believe that the above resources should be an effective start for any newcomer (or critic) who would like to learn more about the fundamental value proposition, technical design, and social/economic impact that Bitcoin can have.For core cryptocurrency components, many of the above resources can also help to supplement your knowledge as we all know how fast everything in the crypto sphere moves.And in the world of cryptocurrencies, always remember — don’t trust, verify.    8,715"
3,Blockonomi,Guide to the Uniworld Ecosystem: Tech For a New Era of AI & Blockchain,Nicholas Say,1594279978.0,"Uniworld is an inclusive AI & Blockchain ecosystem with the vision to bring technologies closer to human’ life and raise living standards everywhere.To achieve its goals, Uniworld provides state-of-the-art infrastructure and high-tech applications and solutions, which are constantly researched, developed, and renovated by Unilab DAO Network.The group is an international organization founded in 2013 and is active across the world, with operations in Japan, Canada, Singapore, Hungary, Poland, and Vietnam.Currently, Uniworld’s main base is located in Singapore, with the legal business registration license certified by the island city’s authority. Singapore is a great place for any kind of blockchain development and offers a rich talent pool, as well as intelligent investors.So far, Uniworld has been focusing on 2 important product layers:The core products of Uniwolrd consists of 2 major components, which are Unichain (an in-house blockchain technology with the power to widely expand the scope of blockchain use) and Unibot (an AI platform with deep self-learning ability).Thanks to the accomplishment of the above 2 core layers, Uniworld has studied and produced a variety of practical products, one of which is called Unime. This product combines the nature of Unichain and Unibot. Specifically, Unime forms a bridge that connects people with a smart society.More Innovations from Uniworld are ComingContents1 More Innovations from Uniworld are Coming2 Learning More About UniChain2.1 A Little About Unibot2.2 Building Bridges With Unime3 An Active Community4 Unicash and The Pre-Sale Launch4.1 Specifications and registration4.2 Unicash Pre-sale DetailsIn the very near future, Uni group is planning to raise funds from the blockchain community by issuing the coin Unicash (UNW) which can be used for any transactions in its ecosystem.To make themselves stand apart when compared to other services using tokens and offering whitepapers, Uniworld has completed building a separate mainnet to nourish “their own coin Unicash / UNW as the native cryptocurrency of UniWorld.io Ecosystem.”More information about Uniworld ecosystem can be found right here.Learning More About UniChainUniChain is a unique blockchain platform that applies the newest technological generation of BC 4.0 in its features, such as “TPS up to millions, cross chain, multichain” with speed and efficiency.At the moment, UniChain allows users to create a UNI wallet to get a reward of 5 UNW and experience instant transactions. Transaction speeds on blockchain networks can be slow, and instant transactions would be a big selling point for the platform.UniChain’s specifications are impressive – from the number of transactions per second (TPS), block time, confirmation time, and so on.Moreover, whilst most of crypto capital raisings are launched with tokens and not a mainnet, UniChain distinguishes itself for completing its own mainnet in April 2020. The company hopes it will empower its ability to develop “basic tools to build a token, side chain on the main network”.If you would like to sign up for an account right now just click here.A Little About UnibotUnibot is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that supports smart web browsing by producing AI bots. Applications for Unibot could be found in both the commercial and domestic sectors.Building Bridges With UnimeUnime is designed to be a bridge that brings humans to a world that has a smart society. Unime 1.0 without the presence of wallets and AI bots are now available for download from Google Play store, while a new upgrade with the integration of crypto wallets and bots is projected to be released by the end of July of this year.Similar to SIGNAL platform, Unime is designed for highly secured calling and texting, without any worries of intervention from a third party. Unime’s platform, which is integrated with 3 other ones, is capable of performing multiple tasks simultaneously.Unime may be a breakthrough when it comes to improving users’ comfort and bringing new technologies closer to real life. It is also a door that opens for new traders to the crypto market. Uniworld has done great work in establishing an ecosystem, which covers almost everything, from “exchanges, wallets, otc, dapp, pure blockchain…”An Active CommunityBecause the group understands the public’s hunger for ways to access information, Uniworld has been developing multiple comms channels, from its official website to popular social networks, such as Telegram, Youtube, Twitter, and Github.Uniworld also communicates its members by frequently updating hot topics on bitcoin or its own news page.Users can also share their ideas with the group via support channels. Uniworld has a business registration number Singapore, which helps to demonstrate that it is sincere about providing value and innovation.Unicash and The Pre-Sale LaunchUnicash is coming soon, and there are ways to participate in the pre-launch and launch of the token. Here are some details if you are interested in getting a head start on the sale.Specifications and registrationUnicash (UNW) is the Uniworld’s own coin that functions similarly to other existing cryptocurrencies. The coin’s total supply is unexpandable at 1 billion UNW.Right now, all information related to Unicash pre-sale, private sale, and public sale has been revealed so that investors can participate if they choose to do so.Officially, UniChain platform is in charge of the initial circulation of Unicash, with the released amount of 300 million UNW. The private sale price is $0.15 per unit, the allocated number is 5%, equivalent to 5,000,000 UNW, and the unlocking rate is 17% per month.The pre-sale and public sale will have a maximum volume of 12,200,000 UNW and 240,000,000 UNW respectively, equal to 1.22% and 24% of the total supply.The unit price in the pre-sale period is approximately $0.24 and the unlocking rate is 17%/month, while the public sale is offered at $0.34/UNW and will be unlocked at 50% a month.Every trader from all over the world can start now by registering an account at:https://accounts.uniworld.io/You will need to create a new UNI wallet, which operates in the same way as other blockchain platforms, such as blockchain.com or TRUST.Unicash Pre-sale DetailsUnicash tokens are being offered early at an attractive rate. The pre-sale round is divided into 3 sessions, taking place on 28 July, 30 July, and 1 August.The first buyers are getting the most competitive price, at $0.22/UNW on the 1st round, and rises up to $0.24 and $0.26 per UNW for the next 2 rounds.There is a specific amount being released, which will be about 2 million UNW on the 1st pre-sale, with the number for the 2nd and 3rd round rising to 4 million and 6 million UNW.Around 40% of the Unicash is projected to be distributed inside the Uniworld ecosystem, while 25% will be spread through the public sale. Other proportions will be allocated to the project team (12%), for marketing (10%), R&D (8%), adviser (3%) and private sale (2%).The only way to buy Unicash is by using the Binance coin (BNB). BNB is easy to buy on Binance or other exchanges that support the token.Uniworld also offers an amazing referral program, which rewards a successful referrer with an extra 5% of UNW. There are 3 different rankings (VIP1, VIP2, VIP3) so as to reward people for recommending the project to people they know.Learn more about the pre-sale, or the affiliate program.Website: https://uniworld.ioBlog: https://blog.uniworld.io/Mia: https://mia.world/uniworldFacebook: https://facebook.com/UniWorld.ioLinkedin: www.linkedin.com/company/uniworldcorpTwitter: twitter.com/UniWorldioInstagram: instagram.com/uniworldbot/Telegram channel: https://t.me/UniworldOfficial    1,812"
4,Blockonomi,Beginner’s Guide to Bitcoin & Crypto Trading Bots,Andrew Norry,1594198836.0,"Unlike the stock markets, the cryptocurrency market never closes and never sleeps, which can be a highly stressful scenario for traders and even casual investors in the industry.Users familiar with crypto investment will also be familiar with the (joyful or sinking) feeling of waking up in the morning to be greeted by a pleasant or unpleasant surprise when they check their portfolio and see large gains or losses.As a result of the volatility of the market, trading bots have become increasingly popular among traders by allowing them to remain in control of their trading at all times, with the bot not sleeping even while the trader is. In addition, a correctly specified bot allows trades to be executed faster and more efficiently than the trader would be able to do manually.The explosion of popularity in cryptocurrency has also resulted in a big increase in the number of crypto trading bots available, either for free from open-source platforms or licensed to users in exchange for flat fees.However, it is difficult to ascertain which of them work as intended and which of them are an absolute waste of time. This post will consider the background to what exactly trading bots are and whether they work for Bitcoin trading (and more importantly, for your Bitcoin trading).

The separate packages include a number of differences, including the number of bots operating on the user’s behalf as well as the maximum equity limit.Although though some knowledge of coding is beneficial when setting up strategies in the CryptoTrader bot, there are a number of free and paid strategies available for users that are not experienced / interested in coding.The CryptoTrader bot also has a wide level of interoperability, with the service offering email and text notifications to alert users on important market events or changes in trends.Read our Indepth Review of CryptoTrader.Visit CryptoTraderHaasbotCreated in 2014 by Haasonline, Haasbot trades Bitcoin and many other altcoins,Although Haasbot is probably the most complete of the trading bots that are currently available, doing much of the labour with relatively minimal input required from the user, in order to provide this service it is pretty expensive, with costs ranging from between 0.04 BTC and 0.07 BTC for a three-month period.At those prices, it is clear that anybody willing to take a chance on it should be knowledgeable about what they expect to get out of the platform and be committed to doing so.Haasbot is an outgrowth of HaasOnline Software, which was started by Stephan de Haas in the 1990’s. The same company is also behind HaasOnline Trade Server (HTS), which is a automated system that is designed to trade cryptocurrencies.The Haasbot platform operates on Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and allows traders to choose from more than 10 different ‘bots’. The more you decide to spend, the more bots you will have access to on the platform.Given the prices involved in using the bots, it is a good idea to do some research on the returns they have generated in the past.Read our Indepth Review of HaasBot here.Visit HaasbotZignalyZignaly is a trading terminal with cryptocurrency trading bots that lets you trade automatically with help from external crypto signal providers. For the moment the platform costs just $12 per month.The platform is incredibly easy to use and can be utilized as a passive income machine. Zignaly lets you easily connect with a TradingView account, so you can use it with your favorite indicators. Alternatively, you can use the Zignaly trading terminal to create your full strategy at once.Because Zignaly is still pre-launch, the number of exchanges that it operates with is limited. The development team says that once the full version is live, KuCoin, Coinbase Pro, Poloniex and  Bittrex will be added to the platform. The company also plans to offer its clients unlimited currency pairs without any additional cost.One of the nicest things about Zignaly, besides the price, is the developers’ commitment to transparency. The full development teams’ info is available online, and anyone who wants to learn more about the founders can find their personal information on their social media profiles.Read our Indepth Review of Zignaly here.Visit ZignalyCap.ClubCap.Club is a simple way to gain access to advanced trading features. The platform was designed in Russia, and currently works on Binance and Bittrex. The platform offers traders automated buying and selling algos, as well as advanced order types.One of the first things that you will probably notice about Cap.Club is the simplicity of both its website and interface. If you are just getting into automated trading, or have little coding knowledge, this simplicity could be a big plus for you.The platform comes in two versions.The free version will give you all of the trading strategies that the full platform features, but you will be limited in how many can run at once. The free account is also limited in communication. The full version will send you alerts via both Email and Telegram, but the free one is only going to contact you with Email.If you want to use the platform for free, it is ready to go. For those that want to upgrade, it currently costs $30 USD per month, or can also be bought on a yearly basis for a discounted price of $300 USD.Simple to Use, Lots of High-End FeaturesDon’t let the simplicity of Cap.Club’s interface fool you, it delivers some high-end trading tools. In addition to limit and trailing orders, Cap.Club offers it users three trading programs:Smart Sell (long)Smart Buy-Sell (long)Smart Sell-Buy (short)These algos seek to make money automatically for Cap.Club’s clients. There aren’t a ton of reviews out there for how effective the algos are, but they are all 100% free to use with the basic package.The platform that Cap.Club put together offers a lot of value, and also is a nice compromise between an algo-driven trading platform, and a trading platform that gives you some of the normal trading tools that are lacking on most crypto exchanges.Cap.Club also includes a visual strategy editor with both the free, and premium package. If you understand how trading strategies work, but can’t put them into code, a visual strategy editor could be a good fit for you.Instead of having to write your own algo in code, you can use a visual strategy editor to lay it out with symbols. Once you have the strategy together, it is simple to run. You may find that your strategy ideas are profitable, and they could help you outperform the market.Cap.Club Gives You a LotThe fact that Cap.Club allows you to use its platform for free is great. While you will be limited in how many strategies and APIs you can run at once, it will help you to figure out if the platform makes sense for you.For frequent traders having some sort way to use limit and trading orders is almost necessary. Buying and selling at market rates isn’t ideal. Trailing stops and take profit orders can help you to ride a winning position, which makes it possible for a single position to make the entire subscription worthwhile.The big downside to Cap.Club is the fact that it only supports two exchanges.If you don’t want to trade with Binance or Bittrex, then Cap.Club isn’t going to be of much use to you. That said, it is really easy to set up Cap.Club with Binance and Bittrex, which makes opening a new account at one or both of the exchanges worth thinking about.Easy Set-Up and SupportOnce you open up your Cap.Club account, all you have to do is go to the exchange of your choice, and generate an API. You will get a new API, and a secret code. Just go back to Cap.Club, and enter the info into the fields it provides you with. The process is super simple, and should only take you a few minutes.Cap.Club also has a deep support section online. If you need help connecting your exchange account to their platform, or figuring out how to use any of the tools, you should be able to find any information you need. The support is included with both account types, which is a great feature.Overall Cap.Club looks like a capable automated trading platform that also gives traders some useful tools, as long as you use one of its two supported exchanges.Visit Cap.ClubExchange ValetUnlike many of the other trading bots on this list, Exchange Valet is more of a trading toolset and crypto portfolio management platform. Most crypto exchanges don’t give traders a ton of tools to use. Exchange Valet is filling in the gaps with commonly used trading tools like simultaneous stop loss and take profit orders.If you are used to using a trading platform like MT4 or MT5, the ability to set simultaneous stop loss and take profit orders is taken for granted. Many exchanges don’t support either order type, or allow traders to use both at the same time.Exchange Valet lets you set both stop loss and take profit orders at the time time, which is extremely useful for active traders.Let’s say you want to open a position in BTC, but your expectation is that it will rally for another 10%. If you are wrong about the direction of the BTC market, there is no need to stick around and watch your trading capital get eaten up by a nasty downward price movement.Exchange Valet’s platform would allow you to open up your BTC trade with both a stop loss and take profit order at whatever price level you like. If you are correct, and BTC rallies by 10%, Exchange Valet will lock in that profit by selling the position. If you got it wrong, your stop loss will keep a volatile market from blowing up your trading account.Handy Portfolio Management Tools Too!Exchange Valet also allows you to keep an eye on all your positions, and rebalance them almost automatically. The platform will display all of your crypto holdings on a pie chart, and allow you to buy a specific percentage of your portfolio’s total value in a single crypto.Let’s say you want to hold 40% of your total portfolio’s value in ETH. Exchange Valet will give you a simple input field that will let you buy whatever percentage of any crypto that you like. This is an easy way to make sure you maintain the balance of cryptos that you like, without doing a ton of work.Exchange Valet also has solid communication tools. All of your orders can be delivered via Telegram (they call it Speedtrade), and other information will be emailed to you if you like. Portfolio info can also be delivered with Telegram, or by using the platform’s proprietary chatbot.Exchange Valet Lacks Some FeaturesIf you are looking for an automated trading platform, Exchange Valet isn’t going to be a good choice for you. While it does offer super useful trading features, it really isn’t a trading bot. It is also limited to Binance and Bittrex. This may or may not be an issue, but it is something to consider.Exchange Valet is also costs cryptos to use. The platform offers new users a 14 day free trial, but after that it will cost you $29 USD per month, $75 USD for three months, or $250 USD if you buy a year’s worth of service.If you are an active trader with a big portfolio these prices could make sense, although there are other platforms that give you more features for a similar price.Two areas where Exchange Valet shines are security and connectivity. The platform meets ISO 27001, ISO 27017, and ISO 27018 standards for data security. It also offers a lot of information via Telegram, which is great if you want to keep an eye on your portfolio when you aren’t in front of a computer.Worth Learning More AboutIf you prefer to trade your own account, Exchange Valet could be a great tool for you. While it does lack algo-based trading features, it does offer traders all the tools they would find on a conventional trading platform.Exchange Valet takes your security seriously, which is great to see. The communication tools that Exchange Valet built are also useful. If you are looking for a platform that fills in the gaps that exchanges left open, Exchange Valet is worth a deeper look!Read our full review of Exchange Valet here.Visit Exchange ValetSignal GroupsSignal is a platform that is made specifically for Binance. Signal does give traders on Binance some badly needed tools, and a high level of connectivity. If you want automated trading, or to use another exchange, this platform isn’t for you.Much like Exchange Valet, Signal gives traders the tools they would find on a trading platform like MT4. In addition to simultaneous stop loss and take profit orders, it also allows traders to program laddered buying, as well as trailing stops.Most of the features that Signal offers are extremely useful for traders. While a platform like Signal isn’t really going to be useful for a crypto investor who is looking to HODL for the long-term, the tools that Signal delivers will help traders who are used to fully-featured trading platforms.Signal is Built for BinanceIf you trade on Binance and are looking for advanced trading tools, Signal could be the right platform for the job. As mentioned above, being able to use stop loss and take-profit orders simultaneously is a must for traders.In addition to adding simultaneous stop loss and take-profit orders, Signal gives you the ability to buy into a position over a period of time. This is called a laddered buy, and it cab be handy if you think there is a big move coming in a token’s price.Instead of buying your entire position at one, you can automatically set Signal up to do the buying for you. This can also be good for larger traders who want to spread their orders out, and reduce the chance they will influence the market price of a token noticeably.Signal also offers two interesting tools that some traders might find useful.The platform allows users to sell existing coins, and also has a ‘targets’ tool. The sell existing coins tool allows Signal users to sell specific coins, and the targets tools lets traders set levels where positions can be sold. Both tools may be handy for advanced traders.Great ConnectivitySignal offers a simple set of tools, but it can be accessed from almost any device. Many of the other platforms on this list have to be run on a computer, and won’t work on iOS or Android.Connectivity is one area where Signal shines. You can use the platform from just about any device, including the two most popular mobile operating systems. If you are looking for a fully-featured trading platform for Binance that you can use almost anywhere, Signal is a good fit.The platform will also notify you via SMS when your orders are executed, which can be handy if you need to stay on top of the market. It also gives you the ability to track your trading performance over time, which can be very handy if you are trading frequently.Not Built for EveryoneSignal isn’t going to be a good fit for every crypto trader out there. While it does fill in some gaps on Binance, it only works with one exchange, and doesn’t offer any sort of algorithmic trading options. If you are looking for a bot, this isn’t the platform for you.There isn’t much information on the costs involved with using Signal, and it could be free. There is also the promise of more features in the future, as the website states that “this is just the beginning.”If Signal is free to use, and the team behind it is planning to add exchanges and features in the future, it is very promising for the platform. As it stands today Signal is a good looking product that has a clean interface, as well as a solid development team behind it.The platform seems to be geared towards frequent traders, and could be a good fit if you are on Binance, and trade a lot. Even with the more basic trading tools that Signal offers regular traders will probably have a much raiser life.Read our Full Signal Review here.Visit SignalLive TraderIf you are looking for a one stop trading bot platform, Live Trader could be the thing for you.

Given that Live Trader takes care of all the hosting, the rates it charges aren’t unreasonable.Geared for AlgosLive Trader is definitely set up for traders that want to use algos. If you are looking for a platform that will give you some advanced order types, and a few basic algos, Live Trader might be overkill. On the other hand, if you are looking for a deep selection of automated trading algos, Live Trader could be a perfect fit.There are a truly amazing number of automated trading algos on Live Trader. In addition to the algos that Live Trader has available, there is also an algo marketplace you can browse through.If you would like to develop your own trading tools, Live Trader has a strategy builder that will allow you to construct your own strategies, and back test them on any exchange the platform supports.

All those cloud servers cost money, and doing the same thing on your own machine would get expensive.Live Trader is a Great Platform for Algo-Driven TradingThere isn’t any getting around the amount of algos that Live Trader lets you access with either the mid or high level subscription. Having 250+ algos to choose from is an amazing tool set for any crypto trader to use.If you are looking for a platform that delivers loads of algos, works with many of the most popular crypto exchanges, and lets you do extensive off-exchange backtesting, Live Trader is worth learning more about.All of the plans also have a solid support system backing them up, which you can learn more about on the platform’s website.

Gekko is entirely free and can be found on the GitHub platform. Gekko is a relatively straightforward trading app to use that includes an interface and basic strategies from the outset, which allows you to be more comfortable with the use of the bot.Gekko also has a number of plugins available that will allow you to be updated regardless of what level of connectivity you have. Although Gekko is not a high-frequency trading bot (making only a couple of trades per week, depending on configuration), nor a bot which allows you to exploit arbitrage opportunities, its list of  supported exchanges and basic strategies means that it is probably a good place to start for anybody interested in utilizing Bitcoin trading bots.Visit GekkoZenbotSimilar to Gekko, Zenbot is also an open-source trading bot for Bitcoin traders. As an open-source project, Zenbot is available for users to download and modify the code as necessary.However, there have been question marks in the community over the development of Zenbot, with no updates having been made to the platform for a significant number of months. This means that no additional exchanges have been added to the platform for almost one year, meaning that it may have access to less information than some of its competitors. However, on the positive side, Zenbot, unlike Gekko, does offer high-frequency trading as well as supporting multiple cryptocurrencies in addition to Bitcoin.Visit ZenbotWhat are Trading Bots?In essence, a trading bot is a software program that interacts directly with financial exchanges (often using API’s to obtain and interpret relevant information) and places buy or sell orders on your behalf depending on the interpretation of the market data.The bots make these decisions by monitoring the market’s price movement and reacting according to a set of predefined and pre-programmed rules. Typically, a trading bot will analyze market actions, such as volume, orders, price, and time, although they can generally be programmed to suit your own tastes and preferences.Trading bots have been popular for many years in various conventional financial markets. However, trading bots have not been traditionally available to the average investor as they cost a significant amount of money.For example, a Bloomberg terminal can often cost in excess of $10k. However, due to the transparent nature of blockchain, cryptocurrency exchanges tend to grant their customers direct market access that provides users with the opportunity to analyze the exchange’s electronic order book, which was a type of access that was traditionally exclusively available to brokers and investment houses in conventional financial markets.With many people trading Bitcoin passively and therefore unable to dedicate large amounts of time to analyze the market, the intention is that Bitcoin bots will allow users to establish more efficient trading without having to keep on top of the market at all times.Types of Trading Bot StrategiesAlthough the cryptocurrency market is much less mature than other financial markets, the digital nature of the market has meant that despite the fact that it has had significantly less time to integrate algorithmic trading, the technology has not been slow in catching up on its rivals in terms of providing a trading bot service, allowing for investors to obtain access to a wide range of trading strategies, some of the most popular of which are considered below:ArbitrageIn the early days of cryptocurrency trading one of the primary strategies that traders used to make profits was arbitrage – i.e. buying assets in one market and then selling them in another for a higher price, thus earning profit on the difference. As cryptocurrency exchanges were decentralized, there were often large differentials between prices offered on various exchanges, meaning that profits could be made through arbitrage.Although the spread between exchanges are much smaller now, they do still appear from time to time and trading bots can assist users in making the most of these differentials. In addition, arbitrage can also be utilized in traders looking to involve futures contracts in their trading strategies by benefiting from any difference that exists between a futures contract and its underlying asset, by considering futures contracts that are traded on various different exchanges.Market MakingTrading bots can also allow investors to use the market making strategy. This strategy provides for “continuous buy and sell prices on a variety of spot digital currencies and digital currency derivatives contracts” in an effort to “capture the spread between the buy and sell price”.In order to carry out the market making strategies, in involves making both buy and sell limit orders near the existing market place. As prices fluctuate, the trading bot will automatically and continuously place limit orders in order to profit from the spread.Although this may be profitable at certain periods, the intense competition around this strategy can result in it being unprofitable, especially in low liquidity environments.Do Trading Bots Work?Trading bots work by reacting to the market. It gathers the data it needs in order to execute a trade based on analysis of the trading platform. However, with cryptocurrency, the trading platform only tells half of the story, with many rises and falls being based on other sources (such as John McAfee’s Twitter or other online rumors!) that cannot be programmed into the bot for analysis.In addition, as noted above, the spread between the exchanges has flattened somewhat, meaning that the opportunities for inter-exchange arbitrage are much lower than in previous years.Many trading bots use what is known as an exponential moving average (EMA) as a starting point for analyzing the market. EMA’s track market prices over a set time period, and bots can be programmed to react to what that price does – such as moving beyond certain thresholds.By programming the bots, traders can set their thresholds to correspond with their risk appetites. However, one of the downsides of EMA is that it is based on past history, which, as all traders will know, is not indicative of future performance, especially in the cryptocurrency industry where volatility is rife. Therefore the question of whether trading bots work is a multi-faceted one in which the problem answer is that they work, but not necessarily for everybody.Trading bots offer a variety of advantages, including having constant interaction with the market, as well as the not-insubstantial factor of removing the emotion from trading. However, on the other hand, by using the wrong trading strategy or relying on the trading strategy of others, a trading bot could simply end up automating a set of poor market trading decisions.Reasons to Consider Using a BotCryptos are a great new asset class, but it is hard to create a return from them in the same way that cash or a stock creates value. Most people associate stocks with gains from price appreciation, but many of the best stocks pay out dividends. There isn’t really an analogue for this in the crypto market, unless crypto owners lease out their cryptos to derive an income from their holdings.From an investment standpoint, passive income is extremely important. As the last year has shown us, we can’t assume that asset prices will show gains year-over-year. One argument for holding stocks through a bear market is that they will continue to pay dividends, which can then be reinvested in the company when the stock prices is depressed.Cryptos are more like a commodity than a company from an investment standpoint, which leaves investors with something of a problem. There is absolutely no reason to hold on to a commodity in a bear market, as it doesn’t deliver any kind of return aside from price appreciation.Trading Bots Give Crypto Investors Income OptionsIf you want to put your crypto portfolio to work for you, trading bots could make sense to use. There are many different kinds of bots out there, and some can take advantage of market movements to create gains automatically.Instead of relying on dividends, trading bots allow you to leverage your crypto holdings to make an income via trades. This system of income generation may not be quite as secure as compounding dividends, but it is one of the only options available to crypto investors.The ‘bot’ is important because unlike a human, it is awake and looking for income opportunities 24/7. Of course, there is no such thing as free money.Any risk that can generate a return has the potential to lose money. It is a good idea to make sure that any automated investment platform you choose to trust with your cryptos can prove that it works with a verifiable transaction history.Be Realistic About ReturnsIt is easy to get carried away with dreams of quick money made in the financial markets.The years that led up to the massive crypto rally of 2017 were amazing, but now the reality of the crypto market is setting in. If you are looking to make the kind of returns that many saw in 2017 with a trading bot, you will probably be disappointed, or go broke.The simple fact is that in order to create returns, you have to take on risk. The bigger the risk, the greater the possible return. On the other hand, when you take big risks, the possibility that you will face catastrophic losses is very real. There isn’t any algo that can ‘de-risk’ trading, no matter how advanced it is.If you are looking to make 3-6% per year on your crypto holdings with a trading bot, you will probably find something that works for you. There are many low risk trading strategies that do produce returns, and an algo will make sure that you don’t lose your discipline lunging for the brass ring.Keep in mind that a portfolio manager than can consistently produce annual returns around 10% will beat 99% of professional money managers. Expecting an algo to do more than that probably isn’t wise.ConclusionTrading bots can assist traders in ensuring that they are always interacting with the market, even when they are physically unable to do so. They can assist in removing some of the stress and emotions that are often found in any financial trading markets, not least the cryptocurrency market.However, trading bots are not for everybody, nor does everybody need one. Casual investors are not the prime target of trading bots, and if your intention is to buy and hold Bitcoin then a trading bot is probably not the correct investment for you.In addition, if you are not a competent programmer or familiar with the creation of financial strategies, trading bots may also not be for you. However, if you have the requisite knowledge and ability to overcome these obstacles then a trading bot can be a worthwhile tool in monitoring and making gains from the Bitcoin market.    231,454"

After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.2) Choose the bot typeThere are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.3) Connect an exchangeThe simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.4) Choose trading pair and set base trade sizeYou can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.5) Set target profitBefore doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.6) Choose take profit typeThere are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.7) Set max safety trades countThis informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.8) Set price deviation to open safety tradesThis tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.9) Set trade start conditionsThis informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.How to Profit from Using the Automated BotsAfter a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.Long – buy lower, sell higherThe bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.Simplified algorithm:Buy initial part of coins.Place a sell order.Place safety buy orders.In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.Short – sell higher, buy lowerIt’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.Simplified algorithm:Sell initial part of coins.Place a buy order.Place safety sell orders.In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.How Smart Trading Works3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.How safe is 3Commas?The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up.

You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.A big step forward came in 2011 with OpenBook, the first social trading platform in the world. This included the then-new CopyTrader feature, which let anyone copy successful traders.In 2012, eToro added stocks to its other assets, like currencies and commodities.The eToro mobile app launched in 2013 for both Android and Apple, expanding the reach of the platform. This is also when eToro dipped into crypto, making it possible to trade Bitcoin via CFDs.In 2015, the platform updated the interface for an even more innovative and intuitive experience.In 2016, it added CopyPortfolio, managed portfolios that bundle various assets or top traders within a market strategy.In January of 2017, eToro expanded its reach in the world of cryptocurrency by adding support for trading crypto to the platform. It began with a range of popular cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and XRP.In 2019 they launched eToroX, a full crypto to crypto exchange.Which Cryptocurrencies Does eToro Support?Compared to other platforms, the options for supported cryptocurrencies on eToro are relatively limited.This is a result of its nature as a general trading platform as opposed to one focused solely on cryptocurrency.Even so, you can short or own the most popular cryptocurrencies. Supported options include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, and Ripple.Cryptoassets are highly volatile unregulated investment product. No EU investor protection. Your capital is at risk. Indicative prices; current market price is shown on the eToro trading platformWhat Sets eToro Apart from Other Platforms?One of the biggest ways that eToro stands out from other platforms is the sheer number of investment and trading options available.Thanks to the numerous ways to invest and trade, users can take advantage of the same platform for their cryptocurrency trading needs as for traditional assets.The social elements of eToro also make it unique. An example is CopyPortfolios, which is a long-term thematic investment in the form of a managed portfolio bundling assets and top traders with a predetermined strategy. The ability to copy the investments of successful traders is also innovative, as is the Popular Investor program.What Trading Tools Does eToro Offer?This platform aims to educate traders as well as provide them with a platform for investment.Upon registration, eToro users get “virtual-money accounts” with $100,000 so they can work on strategies and skills before investing any real money.It also provides multiple other tools to help with actual trading, such as an economic calendar.

With a CFD, investors can speculate on whether fast-moving global financial markets will rise or fall. This can be done with cryptocurrencies as well as indices, shares, fiat currencies, treasuries, and commodities.The important thing to note about CFD trading is that you will not be buying or selling the asset underlying it, in this case, cryptocurrency. Instead, you sell or buy a certain number of units for that instrument based on your prediction of if the price will rise or fall.When the instrument moves in your favor, you get multiples of the existing CFD units you already sold or bought. You make a loss for every point it moves against you. CFDs require caution since it is possible for losses to exceed deposits.You can read more about CFDs in our Beginner’s Guide here.Highly volatile unregulated investment product. No EU investor protection. Your capital is at risk.On eToro, CFD trading and cryptocurrency go hand in hand. As mentioned earlier, eToro first entered the world of cryptocurrency by offering Bitcoin trading via CFDs in 2013, making it one of the earliest players in the world of crypto investments.CFD trading continues to play a key role on eToro since many of the trades involving crypto are still CFDs instead of dealing with the actual asset.Starting on Sept. 3, 2017, those who invested in the BUY position for crypto on eToro actually own the asset underlying the transaction. Before this, they owned a CFD, not the asset. Additionally, eToro offers actual cryptocurrency trading. If you choose to open short or SELL positions for cryptocurrencies on eToro, this is still a CFD position.What Are CopyPortfolios?CopyPortfolios were added to the eToro platform last year. This feature is available for cryptocurrency trading as well as traditional fiat trades. This creates a single tradeable asset that is made up of carefully selected assets or traders of a predetermined strategy.The eToro Investment Committee composes the CopyPortfolios and rebalances them periodically. There are several cryptocurrency CopyPortfolios available for investors to choose from.One of these is simply called “Cryptocurrency” and delivers exposure to Ethereum and Bitcoin.In the cryptocurrency bull run of May 2017, the fund had a 66 percent increase. Within the first three months, that fund generated over 125 percent in profits. Another option is called “Crypto CopyPortfolio.”This is a more recent CopyPortfolio made up of a balanced crypto portfolio containing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Dash, and Ripple.What Is CopyTrading?Another exciting option on eToro that you can use for crypto and fiat investments is CopyTrading.Copy trading is an innovation that allows users to look through the track record of other traders and copy them, which means they will mirror their trades.Traders have the ability to become “Popular Investors” if they have a low-risk score and deliver consistent returns.They then receive rewards for sharing wisdom. By taking advantage of CopyTrading and copying an investor who includes cryptocurrency in your portfolio, you can get exposure to the market without having to do too much research yourself.Past performance is not an indication of future results. Trading history presented is less than 5 complete years and may not suffice as basis for investment decision. This is not investment advice.Who Can Use eToro?eToro can be used by anyone, as long as it is legal to do so in their country. eToro keeps a running list of countries where the platform is blocked due to changes in the regulations that conflict with trading laws.This means that those in the United States, Canada, Cuba, Japan, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Serbia, Albania, and Sudan cannot legally use eToro.Does eToro Have a Minimum Trade Size?eToro prides itself on offering tools that investors and traders of all levels of experience can take advantage of, so it tries to limit the use of minimum trades.Even so, you must have $200 to participate in CopyTrading and make a minimum investment of $5,000 for CopyPortfolios.The minimum quantities for manual positions are based on the instrument. For currencies (such as cryptocurrencies) and commodities, it is just $25.For stocks, it is $50.Finally, for ETFs and indices, it is $200.For those who registered on April 2, 2017, or after, the size of a minimum trade depends on exposure, in the form of leverage times the invested amount. For cryptocurrencies, this total minimum amount is $200.The minimum for ETFs and stocks is $500, for commodities is $2,500, and for indices and Forex is $5,000.As an example of this exposure-related policy, if you open a crypto trade with a leverage of x1, you must invest at least $200. If, however, you chose to invest $100, you must have a minimum leverage of x2.eToro FeesAs an exchange, eToro makes its profits from the various fees that it charges. On eToro, no fees are charged when opening a position, instead generating the fee based on the spread. It has a list of minimum spreads for each cryptocurrency, and those rates are not guaranteed.The team points out that the spread can vary based on liquidity and market conditions.The daily break spreads are as follows: 1.5 percent for BTC, 5 percent for BCH, 3 percent for DASH, 2 percent for Ethereum, 5 percent for ETC, 3 percent for LTC, 5 percent for NEO, 5 percent for XLM, and 3 percent for XRP.InstrumentMarket HoursDaily BreakSpreadSELLBUYBTCBitcoin24/71.5 %-0.471233-0.471233BCHBitcoin Cash24/75 %-0.140DASHDash24/73 %-0.0394520ETHEREUMEthereum24/72 %-0.036712-0.036712ETCEthereum Classic24/75 %-0.0017260LTCLitecoin24/73 %-0.0065750NEONEO24/75 %-0.0123835620XLMStellar24/75 %-0.00004160XRPRipple24/73 %-0.0000220 Because of the nature of cryptocurrency trading, it is available 24/7, and there are no fees for overnight or weekend trades. Instead, eToro only charges fees for users who hold leveraged Ethereum or BTC positions or for shorting cryptocurrencies. The team does point out that the various fees are subject to change.eToro Customer Reviews & ReputationUsers and reviewers of the platform generally agree that eToro is very easy to use. It was designed to be intuitive, so those without trading experience could get the information they need and make trades.You can use the platform on PCs, Macs, Android, or iOS devices, always taking advantage of its intuitive functionality and readily displayed information regarding cryptocurrencies and other assets via graphs and more.In general eToro has a good reputation online, the company is large and well established so you can be sure your funds are safe there. Complaints from people online are generally about traders they have copied not performing as well as they thought they would.This isn’t the fault of the traders themselves, trading is a complicated business as everyone experiences losses as well as gains.Other issues revolve around the fact that eToro advertises heavily that you can buy Cryptos with them, when in fact you don’t actually hold the assets themselves. This is the same for all brokers of this type, if you want to physically own the crypto asset then you will need to purchase them on an exchange that offers this, like Coinbase or Binance.How Do You Deposit and Withdraw Money on eToro?There are multiple deposit methods for eToro, so you can choose the one that best meets your needs, keeping in mind that different methods have varying minimum deposits.You can choose to deposit via wire transfers, bank transfers, Visa, MasterCard, NETELLER, PayPal, Yandex, Webmoney UK, Skrill, and others.To withdraw, you must fill out a form and then typically receive the money via PayPal, a bank transfer, or your credit or debit card. To withdraw, you will need a copy of your signature, color passport copy, and proof of address.Cryptocurrency ExpansioneToro has recently added approximately 35 new fiat pairs to its platform which sees a total of around 44 trading pairs available to its users.

The exchange aims to cater to specialist crypto traders and incorporate many of the features found on their social trading platform.The crypto to crypto exchange features an intuitive user interface, a mobile wallet app, is regulatory compliant, and makes use of cutting edge security protocols, and aims to provide crypto enthusiasts in a number of region with enhanced trading options.You can read our full review of eToroX here.Supported CurrenciesThe platform originally launched with a limited number of cryptocurrencies, however, 16 digital assets and 37 crypto-to-fiat pairs are currently available, and eToroX also incorporates eight branded stablecoins that allow traders to protect themselves from the volatility of the market without having to “cash out” into fiat.The eToro-branded tokens pegged to fiat currencies include the eToro United States Dollar (USDEX), eToro Japanese Yen (JPYX), eToro Euro (EURX), eToro Pounds Sterling (GPBX), eToro Australian Dollar (AUDX), eToro Canadian Dollar (CADX),  eToro New Zealand Dollar (NZDX), and the eToro Swiss Franc (CHFX).In addition to these stablecurrencies, digital assets pegged to the price of commodities also feature and these include the GOLDX and SLVRX coins which respectively remain pegged to the prices of gold and silver.The inclusion of these digital assets help eToroX to remain a crypto to crypto exchange, and more familiar cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dash (DASH), and XRP also feature with more cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and tokens scheduled to be added in the coming weeks.Exchange Fees and LimitseToroX doesn’t charge for deposits, and withdrawal fees are as follows:CurrencyQuick withdraw limitWithdrawal feeAUDX50,0003.75000BCH1660.01000BTC100.00060CADX50,0003.90000CHFX50,0003.00000DASH4000.02500ETH2780.01700EURX45,0002.65000GBPX40,0002.30000JPYX5,500,000330.00000LTC5550.03300NZDX50,0004.25000USDEX50,0003.00000XRP166,6678.50000 The exchange uses a tiered approach with regards to trading fees and the fees for all transactions (under a monthly volume of $100,000) are calculated according to Tier 1.When the monthly trading volume grows beyond Tier 1 (over $100,000), a rebate will be applied during the first week of the month, and depending on the Tier Level, the rebate will be calculated based on the percentages in the following table.The calculation will be done for each calendar month.The rebate will be given in ETHThe Rebate will be given during the 1st week of the month.eToroX also incorporates Maker and Taker fees, and the former are charged for trades where Maker orders add liquidity to the exchange, while Taker orders remove liquidity from the order book and incur their own charges.As a result, Maker fees are lower in comparison due to these orders helping the exchange to remain liquid.An example of a Maker trader order includes placing an order for pending execution, such as a limit order which is not automatically filled (partially or fully).This action helps “make” the market and adds liquidity to the order book, while a Taker order can take the form of placing an immediate order that doesn’t go on the order book, by being filled partially or fully for example. This type of activity “takes” liquidity off of the order book.How Secure is eToroX?The exchange incorporates a number of cutting edge security protocols and these include data encryption by default, with a dedicated secured mechanism being used to prevent CSRF attacks.In addition, the team have developed their own backlog analytic mechanism, based on N.N machine learning algorithm which assists in decision making, and incorporate multiple PT and Code reviews as well as a bug bounty program.User accounts are further secured as all eToroX customers are required to complete Level 3 Identity Verification, and updating financial account information requires dual-process verification.Furthermore, the platform makes use of two factor authentication (2FA), limits login attempts and uses whitelisting attribution models to prevent automation attacks.More stringent security examples include all employee workstations being protected and verified based on multiple security mechanisms that include deception and traps, while the exchange’s custody solution is based on a three level military grade FIPS140 custodian process with multi separation between the different environments.These include a warm environment, or process engine secured solution, a cold, secured isolated gap environment, and a deep, military grade secured isolated environment.On top of this, eToro has been operating in Fintech since 2007 and has established regulated entities in Cyprus, UK, USA, Australia, and South Africa, with Gibraltar now becoming its sixth jurisdiction.The Government of Gibraltar and the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) have set out regulations covering distributed ledger technology (DLT) businesses and eToroX operates under the framework administered by the GFSC.The company is one of the more transparent in the cryptocurrency sector, and ETORO X LIMITED is a limited liability company incorporated in Gibraltar with a registration number 116348, and a registered office at 57/63 Line Wall Road, Gibraltar.The company is authorized by the GFSC as a Distributed Ledger Technology Provider under the Financial Services (Investment and Fiduciary Services) Act, with a license number of FSC1333B.Account VerificationGibraltar’s regulatory requirements ensure that each new account must be verified as part of the registration process, and the exchange aims to simplify the verification process as much as possible.After submitting all your information and uploading all the necessary documents, it can take up to two business days to verify your account.New users are required to upload documents to help prove their identity and residence, and the following documentation will be asked for.Proof of Identity (POI) DocumentThis POI document must include your name, date of birth, a clear photo, the issue date and expiry date of the document.

The questionnaire is made up of nine 9 questions and takes just a few minutes to complete.How beginner friendly in eToroX?As with any trading platform, eToroX takes some getting used to, however, the learning curve will be steeper for anyone completely new to the world of cryptocurrency trading.In order to try and offset this, the team have a Help Section which aims to answer the most common questions, and can be contacted by their customerservice@etorox.com email address.The team can also be contacted via their Twitter account, Telegram group, and Facebook page. In addition to the Help Section, eToroX also aims to educate its users and incorporates a Blockchain Academy and Glossary Section which include a range of clearly written guides and definitions that help users to both navigate the platform and gain a better understanding of blockchain technology.Depending on your background, the more limited selection of trading pairs should make it easier for new entrants to the market to start trading on the platform, while the unique selection of stablecoins should also help newer traders to gain an understanding of how to make profitable trades when dealing with digital assets.eToro CompetitorseToro is in competition with our similar brokers which have covered before, as follows:IQ OptionExpertOptionVantage FXPepperstoneNordFXBinary.comXTBFXTMATFXIs eToro Safe?To provide users with peace of mind, eToro takes steps to provide security.

These include the Hopper Academy which is available to all members and allows everyone to access a video library that explains just how Cryptohopper works and the best ways to use the service.Cryptohopper has also developed an active community, and for new entrants to cryptocurrency trading this should prove to be immensely useful. There are active Discord and Telegram groups, in addition to a special forum for members that is available in English, French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese.As a result, new users are able to converse with and learn from more experienced users from around the world, and continue to learn around the clock.The platform has also been designed to be easy to use, and doesn’t require any professional programming experience or advanced technical knowledge or skills.In addition, Cryptohopper also allows for comprehensive backtesting, and beginners can easily check if their configurations are working accurately by playing around with and testing their setup.Users can see how much they would have earned in the past and adjust their bots to gain a greater understanding of just how everything works while still learning the ropes.Cryptohopper MarketplaceYour Cryptohopper dashboard will give you access to their marketplace, this is a feature that a lot of trading platforms are including these days. The marketplace allows you obtain trading strategies for your bots – some of these are free and others are paid. This is great for beginners as it essentially allows you to “plug & play” your chosen strategy created by more experience traders and test it out on your account.If you an expert in creating trading bots, this could also be a source of income for you by creating and selling your own templates on the marketplace.Is Cryptohopper Safe?The project is very active on social media and boasts a large number of users, and new members can also browse Reddit posts in order to interact with past users and gauge the general sentiment regarding the project.However, there is limited information available about who’s behind the project, although the company has made its Dutch company information public and is registered as Cryptohopper BV, Johan van Hasseltweg 18A 1022 WV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.As with all trading bots, users aren’t required to transfer any money to an account controlled by the bot developers, as the bots usually work via an API that allows them to execute trades on linked exchanges. It is necessary to provide your API keys which are generated on your preferred exchanges, and these keys give the bot restricted access to your account for trading purposes.Furthermore, the bots do not obtain withdrawal rights, and in the event of a hack or data breach, nefarious actors would not be able to directly access your funds. The team at Cryptohopper have also developed working relationships with some of the industry’s leading exchanges and users can also set up two factor authentication (2FA) in order to further secure their accounts.Cryptohopper SummaryCryptohopper is an automated trading bot that trades on your behalf using trading algorithms. Once you connect a hopper to a cryptocurrency exchange, you can select a number of strategies that the bot will implement in order to try and make a profit.The online dashboard allows users to easily monitor their performance as well as the reports of signallers and to subscribe to the best signals.Users can also keep a track of their stats and trading history, as well as the price movements of around 75 cryptocurrencies. Although the service is simple to set up and easy to use it also incorporates a comprehensive range of trading features including:Trailing stop-lossTrailing stop-buyDollar Cost AveragingShortingTrailing stop-shortConfig poolsTriggersBacktestingWalletscrubberAuto synchronizeReserve fundsManual buy and sellConclusionCryptohopper has been engineered to provide the general cryptocurrency community with a viable solution that helps traders to generate profits on a more consistent basis. The mix of technical indicators and third party trading experts or signallers provides traders with increased options as do the template and backtesting features.While Cryptohopper is essentially an algorithmic trading bot it is easy to configure and use and suits newer traders as well as more experienced practitioners. The team have put considerable effort into developing a platform that is beginner friendly and new users are also able to access an extensive education and community led resource sections.The inclusion of the Cryptohopper Academy video series and multi-lingual Hopper forum are extremely beneficial to anyone still getting to grips with either trading cryptocurrencies or learning just how to use trading bots.With its comprehensive list of features, general user-friendliness, and support for 75 different cryptocurrencies and nine leading exchanges, Cryptohopper has a lot going for it and does well to stand out it a market full of competing trading bots and cryptocurrency management platforms.To remain safe, it’s best to set up 2FA on your account, and to make full use of the free trial run, as well as make a modest financial commitment to start off. It may also be a good idea to connect the bot with a live account that contains a moderate amount of funds as there is less to risk if the bot underperforms or the signals do not generate the expected results.It’s also important to note that while trading bots do not have withdrawal access, if they become compromised malicious actors can take advantage of a bot’s API access to purchase extremely low value coins that are then “pumped and dumped”. This has happened in the past, and it’s a security concern that needs to be addressed by both trading bot developers and cryptocurrency exchanges.Furthermore, users have reported that the free third party signals are of a low quality, especially in sideways or bearish markets as the notifications arrive too late, and expose the trading bot to sudden downturns. As a result, users should devote some time to researching signallers and look into subscribing to the more reliable paid signal services.With that being said, with the market starting to pick up, newer traders may look at the Cryptohopper platform as a simple way to get acquainted with the markets and learn how to trade cryptocurrencies before we experience a new bull run.The platform is well positioned to serve both new and more experienced traders and incorporates a number of features that all its members can look to benefit from. It is well designed, easy to use and has developed an excellent reputation over the years and as such we recommend you check them out.Visit Cryptohopper Cryptohopper     9 Ease of Use  9.0/10 Reputation  9.0/10 Pricing  9.0/10 Customer Support  9.0/10 Design  9.0/10 Pros Easy to Setup & ConfigureEducational ToolsGood Exchange & Coin SupportGood MarketplaceLots of Features Cons Have to Pay Extra for Signals   Visit       42,148"
10,Blockonomi,Binance Review: The World’s Leading Cryptocurrency Exchange?,Daniel Dob,1594176544.0,"At this time, the digital currency exchange market is filled with a wide variety of choices, therefore choosing the right exchange or trading platform can be quite a headache for both novice and veteran cryptocurrency users.Binance is a popular cryptocurrency exchange which was started in China but then moved their headquarters to the crypto-friendly Island of Malta in the EU. Binance is popular for its crypto to crypto exchange services.Binance exploded onto the scene in the mania of 2017 and has since gone on to become the top crypto exchange in the world. Binance: The World’s LeadingCryptocurrency Exchange?In our review, we will attempt to outline everything that you need know about Binance, including how it works, the crypto pairs that you can exchange, trading fees/limits, security aspects, and customer support.Visit BinanceHow the Exchange WorksContents1 How the Exchange Works2 Binance Signup & Login3 How to Trade on Binance4 Supported Crypto Currencies5 Binance ICO & BNB Coin6 Binance Fees & Limits7 Is Binance Safe?8 Binance Customer Support9 The Move to Malta10 Launching a Decentralized Exchange11 Launching a Decentralized Stock Exchange12 Binance Jersey Launch – Now Supports Fiat to Crypto12.1 Supported Jurisdictions:13 Buying Bitcoin with Australian Dollars14 Verification15 Paying by Debit and Credit Card16 Binance Launchpad and Initial Coin Offerings (IEOs)17 How Token Offerings Work on Binance Launchpad18 The Lottery System19 Binance Hack20 Conclusion21 Binance21.1 Ease of Use21.2 Reputation21.3 Fees21.4 Customer Support21.5 Payment Methods22 Pros 23 Cons Those who visit Binance for the first time will quickly notice that the platform offers two options for digital currency trading- basic and advanced.Neither the basic, nor the advanced versions are bound to be easy to use for complete beginners. However, anyone with a background in digital currencies and with a bit of knowledge into how exchanges work should be able to use the platform and its different services.The main difference between the basic and the advanced version is that the advanced one offers more-in-depth technical analysis of digital currency value over time.At this time, the dashboard for the basic version offers several graphs and charts for the pairs that you’re trading, order books, and trade history.This is what the basic view looks like :The Basic view is nicely designed and well laid out, all the information you need is clearly presented with prices on the left, graphs in the center along with the buy and sell boxes and the trade history is presented on the right so you can quickly see what the latest trade prices were.And this is what the advanced view looks like:The advanced view uses a dark theme and makes the trading charts larger and the latest trade prices are displayed on the right with the buy sell boxes underneath.Which you choose is a matter of preference really, I like the lighter colored basic view and find the layout a little easier to use.Binance Signup & LoginTo use the exchange, users will first have to create an account. The process behind this is fairly simple and straight-forward and you don’t have to verify your account for level 1 which is a 2BTC daily withdrawal limit.For level 2 which allows up to 100BTC per day, you need to upload a photo ID and wait till you are approved. There are higher limits still, but you will need to contact them directly to arrange that.Time for verification can vary depending on how busy the site support staff are, so make sure to plan ahead if you wish to withdraw larger amounts and make sure this step is complete before depositing and trading large sums on the exchange.Now, that this is out of the way, users can go ahead and fund their Binance account. While you can choose from a multitude of digital currencies, it is recommended that you stick with either BTC or ETH.To fund your account visit the “Funds” > “Deposits / Withdrawals” link at the top of the site and find the currency you wish to send, then click the “Deposit” button next to it which will then you give you the wallet address.You can then send your funds to this address to begin trading on the platform, depending on which currency you deposit it will take different times to show up as this is reliant on that currencies blockchain.Some currencies like Ethereum are faster than Bitcoin which can take a while.Now that your account is funded, you can simply start trading, exchanging and investing in various digital currency pairs. Binance offers plenty of choices, as they support all major digital currencies, but also numerous ICO listings and their respective tokens.At this time, the platform can only be used to generate limit and market orders. This has been considered a disadvantage by some, as many expected trading options that would be more advanced.Following the placement of your order, simply wait for it to be fulfilled according to the terms that have been set.How to Trade on BinanceTrading on Binance is fairly straight-forward if you have used any other cryptocurrency exchange before.To get started, make sure you have deposited some funds – there are options for trading pairs in BTC, ETH, BNB and USDT.Once you have your funds, at the top right menu, select “Exchange” > “Basic” or “Advanced” to load the trading screen. We will be using the Basic view.On the right hand side, of the screen select a tab from BTC, ETH, BNB or USDT this is what you will be trading in. Then choose your desired currency from the list. You can also search here and you can create a favorites list by clicking the star next to any currencies.Once your desired currency has loaded, take note of the left-hand column which shows prices that people are willing to sell at in the top half in red and prices people are willing to buy at in green in the bottom half. The number in the middle shows the last sale price.Now to place a buy order, use the center box underneath the graphs and you will see the buy box is in green on the right.You can manually enter a price you wish to purchase at, but a better way is to click a number on the left-hand column.You can then enter the amount of the currency you wish to buy or click the 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% buttons which will fill it with an amount based on how much of the buying currency you have ( in this case BTC ).Once your order is placed it will be show underneath in the “Open Orders” section until it is filled.At that point your new currency will be available under the “Deposits / Withdrawals” menu where you can withdraw it to the wallet of your choice.Supported Crypto CurrenciesBinance has often been praised for its wide variety of support coins. Traders can use the platform for multiple digital currencies, including, but not limited to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, EOS, Dash, LiteCoin, NEO, GAS, Zcash, Dash, Ripple and more.As mentioned before, Binance also supports numerous tokens, as part of ICO listings. With this in mind, traders can use the platform to trade these tokens for a profit as well.Binance is currently very quick to add new coins and tokens after their ICO which usually means you can purchase them cheaply which allows for greater profit down the road.They currently offer trading pairs in BTC, BNB, ETH and USDT.Binance ICO & BNB CoinAnother thing to note is the Binance Coin, which was issued during their own ICO. The Binance coin can be used to pay fees and it will also feature in their future plans to create a Decentralized Exchange where it will form one of the key base currencies.Purchasing the Binance coin itself looks like a good investment for the future as the exchange plans to use their profits to buy back a portion of the coins every quarter and destroy them: hence decreasing the supply and making them more valuable for holders.Every quarter, we will use 20% of our profits to buy back BNB and destroy them, until we buy 50% of all the BNB (100MM) back. All buy-back transactions will be announced on the blockchain. We eventually will destroy 100MM BNB, leaving 100MM BNB remaining.If you’d like to read more about the BNB Coin, check out our indepth guide.Binance Fees & LimitsAt the time of writing, Binance charges an average fee of 0.1% on each trade that a user makes. Those who choose to pay via the Binance token can get a 50% discount on the trading fee, which is absolutely great news. These are surely some of the lowest fees available at this time.Withdrawal fees tend to vary for each digital currency. For instance, 0.0005 is charged for Bitcoin withdrawals, and 0.005 is charged for ETH withdrawals. Here are some examples to give you an idea of the fees you will be paying for withdrawals:COINCODEFeeUnitBinance CoinBNB1BNBBitcoinBTC0.001BTCEthereumETH0.01ETHLitcoinLTC0.01LTCNeoNEOFreeNEOQtumQTUM0.01QTUMStatusSNT10SNTBancorBNT1.2BNTEosEOS0.7EOSBitcoin CashBCC0.0005BCCGasGASFreeGASUSDTUSDT50USDT When it comes down to transfer limits, there is no limit on the number of coins that you can deposit. However, without getting verified, users are limited in terms of how much they can withdraw.Verification will establish you as a level two users, thus lifting these limits and providing a lot more freedom when using the platform.The verification process requires users to provide Binance with their full name, country, gender, a photo of passport/government-issued ID, and even a selfie with the passport.Is Binance Safe?While Binance is one of the newest cryptocurrency exchanges available on the market, it has quickly managed to attain a high level of trust from its users and the digital currency community.However, the exchange fails to provide users with enough information on how the funds are being secured, yet we like to believe that security is taken seriously. Two-factor authentication is available and is always a nice sight. It is however known that the platform offers a multi-tier and multi-tier system architecture.Update: In March 2018 Binance suffered a hacking attempt.The hackers tried to pull off an audacious move which was luckily caught by the automated systems in place at the exchange. For months the hackers had been accumulating people’s logins via a phishing website and secretly installing API access on the affected accounts.They then struck, converting all the victims altcoins to BTC and purchasing Viacoin, pumping the coin to a huge price and then selling their own supply of Viacoin at the high point, before trying to withdraw the BTC to their own wallets. Luckily no one lost funds as the hack was caught and the only people to lose out were the hackers, whose funds will be donated to charity.As this hack was made possible by people entering their site logins and 2FA details into a fake website, you should always make sure you are on the correct Binance url before logging in. We recommend you bookmark the site and only use that to access it, never click links from emails, Twitter, Telegram etc.This event has done a lot to instill confidence around Binance, not only did their automated processes catch the attempted hack before anyone lost any funds, they have since offered a $250,000 bounty to anyone who can help catch the hackers. Throughout this event, Binance acted exemplary and have been praised for their swift action in resolving this.Binance Customer SupportFor an exchange to be successful, it requires a great customer support team, capable of answering all user questions and requests in a timely manner. While the support area on Binance could use a little work, the team is responsive and capable of offering professional aid to traders in need. Support tickets are submitted via an online form featured on the website, and responses are made via email. There is currently no live chat support, nor a phone number where customers can get in touch with the support team.Other than the CS team, Binance offers a couple of FAQs and articles meant to help users get accustomed to the exchange and the way it works.It should be noted that customer support on Binance has been known to be slow to respond to customer requests. This is a familiar phenomenon with most of large exchanges and is due simply to the volume of users and amount of support staff.The exchanges have grown at an explosive rate this past year and the companies simply haven’t been able to keep up with demand. Binance grew fast especially, going from launch to the largest exchange on the planet in a few short months.Support staff for exchanges have to be carefully vetted and trained due to the technicalities and security requirements involved – unlike other traditional companies where staff can be trained quicker.Some things to bare in mind are double-checking wallet addresses, make sure you are sending the correct cryptocurrency to it’s corresponding address on the site. Mixups with wallets are one of the biggest mistakes people make when using exchanges.Other things to note are, try a smaller test payment first if you plan to transfer large sums – it may cost you a little more in fees but will be worth it for peace of mind.If you do need to contact support, make sure you provide them with enough information to be able to help you first time. Include wallet addresses, times of transactions and any other information you think they might need to help speed up the process.The Move to MaltaIn March 2018, Japanese Newspaper Nikkei reported that Binance was trading in Japan and not following their official regulations. This caused some turbulence in the markets until Binance made an official announcement that they were going to be moving operations to the crypto-friendly island of Malta in Europe, stating :After reviewing several different locations, the company decided to invest in the European nation due to its existing pro-blockchain legislation and the stability that it offers financial technology companies through its regulatory framework.This is good news for the company and they even received a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Malta on Twitter.Binance also announced that they were in talks with Maltese banks with the goal of providing Fiat transactions, meaning they can offer an on-ramp for fiat to crypto transactions in future along with fiat trading pairs on the exchange.More good news for Binance, it seems as their profile and reputation within the industry continues to grow.Launching a Decentralized ExchangeMore recent news for Binance and what seems like good news BNB holders is the fact that they are planning to launch their own Decentralized Exchange ( DEX ):“After extensively researching decentralized exchange frameworks and analyzing existing implementations, we believe significant improvements can be made in providing Binance users with a level of trading experience to which they are already accustomed. Centralized and Decentralized exchanges will co-exist in the near future, complementing each other, while also having interdependence.”The BNB digital asset, now an ERC-20 token, will migrate as the native token of that network and be used for paying the trading fees on the new exchange.Launching a Decentralized Stock ExchangeMore good news recently for Binance is that they are partnering with Neufund to build the world’s first Decentralized Stock Exchange.Alongside the Malta Stock Exchange, they are aiming to create a regulated and decentralized, global stock exchange for listing and trading tokenized securities alongside crypto-assets.According to CapLinked, the market cap of equity tokens alone is projected to reach $1 trillion by 2020 and thanks to the partnership with MSX, a subsidiary of the Malta Stock Exchange and Binance, Neufund will become the first end-to-end primary issuance platform for security tokens, in particular, equity tokens. It will secure ways for secondary trading of equity tokens and enable companies around the world to fundraise on Blockchain in a legal way while offering much-needed liquidity.This is more positive news for Binance as they aim to consolidate their position as the world’s number one Crypto Exchange.Binance Jersey Launch – Now Supports Fiat to CryptoAs of 16th January 2019, Binance has announced the launch of a new Fiat to Crypto exchange named “Binance Jersey“.The trading platform is live and active and allows you to trade in fiat currencies such as euros and pound sterling, with Europe being their target market.We have now carried out a full review of Binance Jersey, so take a look for more indepth details about the new platform.Visit Binance Jersey »At the time of writing they are only offering four trading pairs with more to follow soon:BTC / EURBTC / GBPETH / EURETH / GBPSupported Jurisdictions:ArgentinaEswatini (formerly Swaziland)LatviaRomaniaArmeniaFinlandLiechtensteinSingaporeAustraliaFranceLithuaniaSlovakiaAustriaGermanyLuxembourgSloveniaAzerbaijanGibraltarMacauSouth AfricaBelgiumGreeceMaltaSouth KoreaBrazilHong KongMauritiusSpainBulgariaHungaryMexicoSwedenCanadaIcelandMonacoSwitzerlandChileIrelandNetherlandsTurkeyCroatiaIsraelNew ZealandUnited Arab Emirates (UAE)CyprusItalyNorwayUnited Kingdom (UK)Czech RepublicJamaicaPeruUruguayDenmarkJapanPolandEstoniaJerseyPortugal Customers who wish to trade in the support fiat currencies will need to carry our KYC procedures by uploading their ID documents such as passport and driving license.Wei Zhou, Binance’s CFO released this statement about the launch :“Expanding the cryptocurrency exchange markets with fiat currencies in the European region is opening new economic opportunities for Europeans as well as freedom from looming Brexit uncertainty where the pound and euro are also in concern. Through Binance Jersey, we want to help bridge the crypto-fiat channel for Europe and the U.K. as part of our global expansion to support broader cryptocurrency adoption”.If you are familiar with trading on Binance, then you will feel at home on their new exchange – it uses the same engine and the trading screen is laid out in the same fashion with the option to choose between Basic and Advanced views:To fund your account in fiat, you will first need to complete the KYC process, once that is done you can then deposit funds directly from your bank account by linking it from the Deposits screen.You can also fund your account with BTC or Ethereum. Once you have your account setup and bank account linked, you can also withdraw funds in fiat currency – this is great news as Binance is now able to offer a way for investors to cash out their cryptocurrencies.We have upgraded our review scores below and we feel this is a huge improvement to Binance’s Exchange offering, if they manage to roll this out to even more countries ( USA is currently excluded) it could be a game changer as people now have an extra, regulated fiat on and off ramp for their holdings.Buying Bitcoin with Australian DollarsOn March 20, 2019, Binance announced the launch of Binance Lite Australia, the continent’s first fiat gateway to the world of cryptocurrencies which provides a secure, reliable, and easy to use way to buy Bitcoin with cash in Australia.The cash-to-Bitcoin brokerage service operates via a network of over 1,000 newsagents across Australia, and currently allows anyone to buy Bitcoin using Australian Dollars (AUD), and there are plans to include additional digital currencies and fiat purchasing options in the future.Users must first undergo account verification on Binance Lite, and after being successfully verified, users can place online orders and deposit cash at their nearest newsagent, in order to receive their pre-ordered Bitcoin.The Binance Lite brokerage service is operated by InvestbyBit, an independently operated subsidiary of the Binance.com cryptocurrency exchange. The service aims to simplify the process of purchasing cryptocurrencies and make digital assets such as Bitcoin readily accessible across Australia.Fees A 2.5% transaction fee (50% discount applied) plus GST on the transaction fee for each purchase is currently being charged as an introductory rate. Therefore, for a $50 order, the transaction fee will be $1.22 and the GST will be 10% of the transaction fee, which is $0.12.Limits The system is currently in its Beta phase, and the minimum purchase amount has been lowered to $30 with the maximum purchase amount capped at $1000. These limits may change over time and only multiples of $10 are being accepted, such as orders for $50, $60, $70 etc.VerificationFirst time customers are required to go through a one-time Know Your Customer (KYC) document verification. When using the service, it’s necessary to follow the instruction prompts after the order page and go through the verification.In order to complete the verification process, it’s necessary to submit 1 or 2 forms of government issued ID documents as a Passport, Driver’s Licence, or Medicare card, in addition to your residential address. Any returning customers, who have already completed KYC verification, will be sent to the order summary page directly after opening a new order.Each account is linked to a mobile number, and users should ensure to use the mobile number provided when first completing the verification process. Anyone choosing to use a new mobile number will be required to complete the ID verification process once again.Paying by Debit and Credit CardBinance allows users to make debit and credit card payments for cryptocurrencies via a partnership with Simplex. It’s possible to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP tokens by Visa and MasterCard and the benefits of using a debit or credit card on Binance include:Swift Transfers: Average 10-30 mins for cryptocurrency to reach your walletLow Fees: only 3.5% per transaction or 10 USD, whichever is higherConvenient: Visa and MasterCard acceptedIn order to purchase the supported cryptocurrencies with a debit or credit card, users can first go through the official instructions page and then visit: https://www.binance.com/en/creditcard.Binance Launchpad and Initial Coin Offerings (IEOs)Binance Launchpad is the exchange’s token launch platform that aims to connect blockchain projects with the greater cryptocurrency community and enable projects to raise funds while interacting with Binance’s significant user base.In December 2017, the BREAD and GIFTO projects were able to hold successful token sales on Binance Launchpad and projects such as BitTorrent and Fetch.AI have also held successful launches in 2019.The platform makes use of the exchange’s native BNB token and rewards users for holding the token as well as allowing it to be used to participate in token sales.Read: What is an IEO?How Token Offerings Work on Binance LaunchpadThe ability to part in token offerings continues to attract a significant amount of users to Binance and it’s necessary to go through a number of steps in order to get used to the Launchpad platform.Anyone interested in a project should first go to the Binance Launchpad website and click on the project page and thoroughly research any of the projects on offer.If not already done, it’s also necessary to complete your Binance account verification, as token sales are carried out in compliance with the regulatory requirements in supported user jurisdictions.The Lottery SystemBinance Launchpad operates a lottery system which sees that the number of lottery tickets you can claim being dependant on the amount of BNB tokens you hold in your Binance account over a 20-day period leading up to the day of the lottery, with a maximum of up to 5 tickets per eligible account.The 20 days leading up to the lottery draw date is represented by X below, and  by example, 100 ≤  X < 200 means that your BNB balance over the entire 20-day period is kept at 100 BNB or more, but does not exceed or reach 200 BNB.A snapshot at 0:00 AM (UTC) each day records each user’s BNB balance, and should your BNB balance drop below the minimum balance required on any given day during the 20-day period, they will be put into the lower threshold.For example, if User A holds 301 BNB for 19 of the 20 days but their balance drops to 299 BNB on one day. They will move to the lower threshold and only be eligible to claim 2 lottery tickets.Before the actual lottery date, users are given a 24 hour period to select how many lottery tickets they wish to enter, with the maximum number based upon their BNB holdings over the previous 20 days.Here, if a user submits an entry of 5 tickets and 2 tickets end up winning, they are committed to pay for 2 ticket allocations (in BNB) for the tokens.Each lottery ticket has a unique number with multiple lottery ticket holders, obtaining tickets with consecutive numbers. For example, when claiming 5 tickets, the tickets may be numbered 100010, 100011, 100012, 100013 and 100014.Once the 24 hour period ends and all tickets have been fully issued, Binance begins to randomly select multi-digit numbers. These are matched against the tail digits of all issued tickets in order to determine the list of winners.The selection process continues until the maximum number of winners are matched, and the respective BNB is deducted from each winning user’s balance, as soon as they are deemed a winner.Binance announces the maximum number of potential lottery ticket winners, and the allocation amount corresponding to each winning ticket in advance.Binance HackAt the start of May 2019, Binance suffered their first Hack which we covered here on Blockonomi. In short, a hacker was able to gain access and bypass some of their security measures using key user information, including API keys, used by trading bots and third-party portfolio managers.They were able to withdraw over $40million worth of cryptocurrency from the exchange.Binance decided to fully cover these losses using their “SAFU” security fund, and reimbursed all users of any losses they suffered.The fact that Binance covered these losses, gives us more confidence in their honesty and integrity but also underlines the important fact that you should follow security best practices and only keep small amounts of crypto on exchanges.Make use of Hardware wallets to store your funds securely as it seems even the biggest exchanges are not immune to this type of attack.ConclusionCurrently, the matching engine of the exchange is capable of processing approximately 1.4 million orders each second, hence making it one of the fastest exchanges available on the market.Additionally, the exchange works on all forms of devices, including web, Android, WeChat, and HTML5. Non-English speakers will be happy to know that Binance offers multiple-language support in Chinese, English, Korean and Japanese.Based on everything that has been outlined so far, Binance is undoubtedly the leading Cryptocurrency Exchange and offers great fees and awesome digital currency support.As it reportedly has access to abundant resources and partners, chances are that Binance will continue to evolve and offer great digital currency exchange services to its clients.We are happy to recommend Binance and have added it to our list of the Best Cryptocurrency Exchanges.We have continued to update this review since Binance was first launched ( we were one of the first to offer a review of the platform at the time ).

Even if things go badly, these funds can be replenished, giving traders a consistent pool of funds to practice with.Order Types & Stop Loss ToolsAs is expected of modern trading platforms, IQ Option gives traders a range of order types to reduce risk and customize the trading experience. The variety of order choices lets traders create strategies that are short-, medium-, or long-term and featuring a variable return. Multipliers let traders increase the risk level for an investment with a corresponding increase on the return.Stop loss orders let traders set maximum losses that they will accept, automatically closing the trade if it is triggered. Take profits do the same thing but when the trade reaches the profit you specify. A trailing stop will lead to dynamic operation of an auto-close at loss, moving with the price in the direction the trader indicates. Purchase at preorders lets traders set a price at which enter the market.To supplement the order types, IQ Option offers a range of tools for setting stops and take profits. While most brokers just let you select the asset price, IQ Option lets you set the take profit or stop loss at either a percentage, numerous loss, or specific asset price. There is also the choice to apply the dynamic stop loss or trailing stop and the ability to use the balance to keep a position open if it exceeds the stop loss.Order TypesThere are numerous order types available with IQ Option, with the specific types of order available varying by asset.Multiplier orders allow you to increase the return on investment and your level of risk via a coefficient. This is a popular tool among advanced traders, but it should only be used by those with experience due to the increased risk. When used properly, it can dramatically increase potential profits.Stop loss orders let you set maximum losses that you will accept. When this type of order gets triggered, it automatically closes the trade to minimize your losses.Take profit orders are almost the opposite of a stop loss order. You indicate the amount of profit you want to reach, and the order automatically closes when it reaches this point.Trailing stop orders build on the idea of a stop loss by dynamically using auto-close at stop. A trailing stop order will move with the changes in price in the direction that you indicate.Finally, a purchase at or pre-order lets you choose the price at which you want to enter the market. When the market reaches this point, the trade will automatically be executed.Charting ToolsTo ensure traders can get the most from the IQ Option trading platform, the broker offers a long list of charting tools that can provide insights and help clients craft their trading strategies.Candle charts are among the most popular for IQ Option traders. These candles indicate a period of time, with solid colors indicating volatility during the given period and points marked for the price at both the beginning and the end of the given period.Hollow candles are similar. However, instead of always using solid colors, the positive candles are hollow and the negative candles are solid.IQ Option also offers area charts that show the price in the form of a line, complete with shading for the area underneath. Line charts are similar, but the area underneath the line is not shaded.Finally, bars, like candle charts, cover a period of time you specify. They indicate the prices at the beginning and end of the period but do so with vertical lines. There are complementary horizontal lines that display the prices at open and close.IndicatorsWith the indicators on IQ Option, you can spot trends and better identify potential trades that will lead to profit. IQ Option offers 13 indicators that are available via the charting interface.Many can be used independently or together to maximize your results and insights.Moving Averages (MAs) include Simple Moving Averages, Weighted Moving Averages, Smooth Simple Moving Averages, and Exponential Moving Averages. These can help provide insights into current trends and can be used with other indicators.The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows where moving averages converge and diverge, essentially visualizing the ratio between two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs).The Parabolic SAR has a similar purpose to moving averages. However, the position changes based on the price and it moves in conjunction with higher acceleration. It shows up in a group of small dots.The Awesome Oscillator indicates a visualized ratio of two SMAs (Simple Moving Averages), with one fast and one slow. The indicator helps show new trends’ development and completion.Bollinger Bands are trend indicators showing a dynamic range for price movement.Volume Indicators show the quantities of your chosen asset that were bought and sold within a given period, indicating interest.The Alligator Indicator helps you assess market movement in terms of direction and assists with filtering Side Bands (no-trend periods). Overall, this indicator helps traders find emerging trends, and it is cross-functional.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) helps figure out a current trend’s strength, as well as potential reversal points. It compares asset price growth (absolute) with the total price reduction, showing it via a curve.The Stoch or Stochastic Oscillator indicators show a price’s current position in comparison to the extremes from your selected period. This is shown as a percentage and helps you determine likely reversal points.The Average True Range (ATR) displays a trading asset’s current volatility within your chosen period and determines the change rate of quotes.The Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) shows a trend’s strength before the price movement begins. It can also indicate potential market volatility changes.A fractal is a series that includes a minimum of five Japanese candlesticks, showing the local maxima and minima of price curves as well as market reversal points.Finally, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) measures the speed associated with price movements. It helps traders determine upcoming market reversals and can detect extrema or assess a trend’s strength.Additional FeaturesIQ Option places a good amount of focus on its users and the platform enables customers to trade with confidence by incorporating a number of features that greatly enhance the overall trading experience.

Since then, the broker has grown considerably and includes specific figures on its website to help show its growth. Starting with the number of active users, there were 8,110,000 registered users in 2015, which had nearly doubled to 14,680,000 by 2016 and reached 25,580,000 in 2017. This represents registered user growth of a whopping 17 million just between 2015 and 2017.Not only did IQ Option have an expansive growth in active users, but the countries that these traders were from increased. In 2014, IQ Option had traders in 135 countries, growing to 148 countries in 2015, 150 in 2016, and 151 in 2017.IQ Option also lists the figures related to trades throughout the years. Between 2013 and 2014, the number of daily transactions increased by nearly 70 times. Between 2015 and 2017, this figure grew another 2.5 times. For those interested in specifics, 2015 had an average of 646,000 transactions each day, which increased to 956,000 by 2016 and 1.8 million by 2017.Or you can look at the figures representing growth in terms of trading volume per month. Between and 2017, this figure increased by about 23 times. In 2014, the figure was $16 million, which became $89 million, an increase of 5.5 times in just a year. By 2016, this was $184 million, more than doubling in just a year. Between 2016 and 2017, the monthly trade volume increased to a whopping $380 million. This means that for two consecutive years, IQ Option doubled its monthly trading volume.That trading volume does not all stay inside the platform. Instead, there is also an increase in the amount that traders withdraw from the platform each year, showing that the active users are truly earning money. In 2015, traders withdrew $1.5 million per month, which became $5.8 million in 2016 and $10.8 million in 2017. In other words, 2017 saw 1.8 times more money withdrawn by traders from IQ Option compared to the previous year.It is also worth noting that these withdrawals have increased in speed. In 2016, IQ Option made changes to offer instant withdrawals. This allowed for 68 percent of withdrawal requests to be processed immediately. Now, the average time for processing a withdrawal from IQ Option is just one day. The order processing has similarly improved, now averaging just a second.IQ Option also offers indications of how its customer support has improved over the years. When chat support began in 2014, there was an average wait of 7 minutes for a reply in chat, which decreased to 4 minutes in 2015, 46 seconds in 2016, and 38 seconds in 2017. On a similar note, the amount of time it took to answer a ticket decreased from two hours in 2015 to 24 minutes in 2016 to just 16 minutes in 2017. Some of this is also due to the growth of the support team, which only had 25 members in 2015 but grew to 39 members in 2016 and 78 in 2017.The number of affiliates has also grown from 3,000 in 2014 to 84,000 in 2017. This included 21,000 affiliates in 2015 and 48,000 in 2016. Along with the growth of affiliates, those affiliates have consistently earned more every year. Affiliates earned $200,000 monthly in 2014, $810,000 in 2015, $2.3 million in 2016, and an impressive $4.6 million in 2017.IQ Option AwardsOver the years, IQ Option has accumulated an extensive list of awards, each of which shows off one of the platform’s strengths.

As such, IQ Option has a license from CySec, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission. To receive that license, IQ Option met, and must continue to meet, minimum requirements related to marketing restrictions, client funds, and trading products. The registration in Cyprus as a financial services provider has number 247/14, giving IQ Option the ability to take on European clients, who then receive full CySec protections.Due to CySec regulations, all client funds must be stored in segregated accounts that IQ Option cannot access for its own brokerage business. CySec regulators also offer a level of deposit insurance, which protects a certain level of all investments made with IQ Option if something happens to the broker.IQ Option USAUnfortunately, IQ Option is not available to traders in the United States. The broker is available in 178 countries around the world, but the United States has stricter restrictions and regulations, meaning American traders cannot use the broker.

IQ Option will expect to receive copies of identification documents such as: Passport or National ID Card issued by a Government AuthorityProof of Address in the form of a Utility Bill or Bank Statement is required from EU residents.IQ Option Customer Reviews Most online reviews from customers of IQ Option are positive, but there is the occasional negative review, as should be expected. Some complaints relate to the fact that IQ Option requires KYC procedures to verify your identity before you withdraw funds. However, these procedures are normal for any broker dealing with fiat currency, and even many cryptocurrency exchanges require KYC procedures.Some users also indicate that withdrawing funds can be challenging at times with the occasional issue related to having an account blocked. However, this does seem straightforward to resolve and may come down to KYC issues; the reviews are not clear on the cause.Those reviews that indicate complaints against IQ Option are regularly interspersed with positive reviews. It also seems that many of the negative reviews posted online are not actually from customers. Instead, they are from people who claim to have had issues as a way to promote another service. When you look at online reviews from people who claim to be customers of IQ Option, remember to take them with a grain of salt since many are clearly from competitors or people with ulterior motives.When read with a critical eye, the overall trend of seemingly valid reviews of IQ Option from customers seems to be neutral to positive.Is IQ Option a Scam ?While carrying out this review and researching other people’s opinions online, we found a number of complaints from people calling the site a scam. Some reasons mentioned are that they disabled a person’s account which didn’t allow them to withdraw their balance and a lot of disgruntled people who seem to have lost money trading on the platform.But we also found overwhelming number of positive comments about the company which seems to point that the few who have had problems with them are the more vocal people online.In our view there is absolutely no way this company can be considered a scam, the company is a tightly regulated business with a high revenue turnover, official business premises and high quality website and trading software.Is IQ Option Safe?In addition to practices such as maintaining segregated accounts for client funds, IQ Option offers security in several other ways. Unsurprisingly, the broker has full SSL encryption. As such, all communication that traders send to the broker’s servers is encrypted in a way that meets AES 256 Bit encryption standards. That encryption limits the ability of hackers to access information, letting IQ Option supply added protection of both client funds and information.ConclusionIQ Option is an impressive platform that provides its users with a great amount of value. The site merges a good level of transparency and functionality and users can be comfortable knowing that the platform is in keeping with the latest financial regulations.Trading on the site is generally quite a smooth experience and the platform utilizes an intuitive UI that is easy to navigate. The platform and trading application is functional enough for professional traders whilst also being simplistic enough to allow new entrants to painlessly learn the trading process. IQ Option is a company on the rise and has grown to managing almost 15 million accounts and processing 3 million trades per day. The site also enjoys a trading volume of $11 billion a month and pays out approximately $5.7 million to its users on a monthly basis.The site does have its drawbacks, and users who require extensive interaction with a customer service agent may be unfulfilled by the two account levels. In order to be in consistent communication with a personalized account manager traders are expected to pay a $3000 fee which may be too restrictive for some. The site is also proving to be popular with traders around the world and despite IQ Option devoting time and energy to developing its customer service, there is the possibility that users may have to wait for more than 24 minutes in order to have their queries processed.Finally, IQ Option is not available to the residents of countries such as the United States, Canada, and Japan. These nations are home to large numbers of financial literate individuals and the platform would be better off with their presence. However, IQ Option still caters to traders from over 178 countries and provides a comprehensive service to all its users. The platform caters to stock, Forex, and cryptocurrency traders and individuals who sign up can be sure to interact with an intuitive platform that provides access to a wealth of resources, and trading options.Click to Visit IQ OptionRisk Warning: As always with trading, you should know the risks before hand – these are volatile markets where it is completely possible to lose large sums of money if you do not know what you are doing.

13,Blockonomi,Coinbase Review: Ultimate Guide to The Top Crypto Exchange,Oliver Dale,1594171340.0,"With the interest and investment in cryptocurrencies having surged over the past few years, the requirement for safe and secure exchanges to facilitate the purchase of crypto has become increasingly important.One of the most popular exchanges that is currently available is Coinbase.Launched in San Francisco in 2012, Coinbase operates in 32 countries and has served over 12 million customers to exchange over $40 billion in digital currencies.By 2013, Coinbase was the highest funded Bitcoin startup as well as the largest exchange of cryptocurrency in the world. Unlike other exchanges that require users to trade on a market, Coinbase allows users to trade their cryptocurrency at a set price that is based on their market value, which allows users to purchase their cryptocurrencies faster than other exchanges.Coinbase is one of the easiest exchanges to use to purchase Bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies with fiat via Bank Transfer, Credit Card, Debit Card & Even PayPal.Read on for our full review.Visit CoinbaseCoinbase FeesContents1 Coinbase Fees2 Setting up a Coinbase Account3 Is Coinbase Safe?4 Coinbase Customer Support5 Supported Countries6 Transaction Limits7 Transactions Using Cryptocurrency8 Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro ( formally GDAX )9 Monitoring of Accounts10 Coinbase Downtime11 Coinbase Custody12 Coinbase and Paradex13 Instant UK Bank Purchases14 Coinbase Bundle15 Coinbase Custody16 Coinbase Staking17 OTC Trading18 The USDC Stablecoin19 How to earn free crypto with Coinbase20 The Coinbase Wallet app21 How to use the Coinbase Wallet App22 The Coinbase Card23 Fees and Spending Limits24 Coinbase Security25 Further Expansion26 Conclusion27 Coinbase27.1 Ease of Use27.2 Reputation27.3 Fees27.4 Customer Support27.5 Payment Methods28 Pros 29 Cons Coinbase charge fees ranging from roughly 1.49% to 3.99%, depending on your payment method, with credit card transactions resulting in fees at the higher end of the scale.Coinbase fees are generally lower than other competitors who operate a similar business model, such as Coinmama or CEX.Coinbase allows users to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin along with a whole range of other cryptocurrencies with more being added all the time.In addition, Coinbase operates the Coinbase Pro exchange, which is intended to focus on more advanced traders.Setting up a Coinbase AccountBy following the below step by step guide, you will be able to buy cryptocurrency through Coinbase.Signing up – To create an account on Coinbase, all you need is your name, email address and password.Account Type – Upon request, you will be asked to confirm your email address. Once completed, you will be redirected to the startup page, where you will be first requested to confirm whether you want to create an individual or business account.Verify your Phone Number – The next step is verifying your phone number. The reason for this is to create a form of 2-factor identification in order to ensure that your account remains secure. Other 2-factor identification methods are also available, as set out below.Set up Payment Method – As stated above, Coinbase allows customers to choose from two payment methods – bank transfer and credit card. For bank transfers, Coinbase will often set up one or two small transactions to and from your account, in order to verify your account. For credit cards, a screenshot of the credit card is necessary. Bank transfers in the US can take up to 4 to 5 days to complete, or 1-3 days by SEPA transfers in the EU, while credit and debit card transactions are instant. Coinbase also allows for users to link their Paypal account to the platform, but this can be used for proceeds made from selling cryptocurrency only.Buy Cryptocurrency – Once you have funds in your account you can buy currency. It’s important to make sure that you are on the right tab of your account to purchase the correct currency. Before confirming the transaction, Coinbase provides you with details of the service fee and the amount of cryptocurrency being purchased in the transaction. Once confirmed, the amount of cryptocurrency that you have purchased will be credited to the relevant Coinbase wallet.Is Coinbase Safe?One of the perceptions of cryptocurrency among newcomers to the platform is that it is still risky to invest in. And although it is correct that there have been issues around cryptocurrency exchanges in the past (such as Mt. Gox),Coinbase is considered to be one of the most secure platforms currently available. First of all, Coinbase is US based and is therefore required to comply with US State and Federal law. This can be contrasted with some of their competitors that operate in countries that may have lighter regulations when it comes to such platforms.Coinbase has actively pursued discussions with regulators in order to ensure that they were providing an open and innovative financial system and the regulation of Coinbase is considered by some to have restored confidence in cryptocurrencies following the Mt Gox collapsed (although other commentators have complained that Coinbase operates more like a bank, which, within the community, is against the fundamental nature of a decentralised cryptocurrency).In addition, Coinbase has received investment from a number of high-profile backers, including the Bank of Tokyo and BBVA, which boosts its legitimacyWhen it comes to storage of funds, Coinbase is transparent about its methods. Coinbase segregates customer funds from company operational funds, with Coinbase stating on their website that any funds held on behalf of customers are stored in custodial bank accounts and, in the event of insolvency, neither Coinbase nor its creditors would have any rights or entitlements to such customer funds.In terms of its cryptocurrency storage, Coinbase states that 98% of customers’ cryptocurrency funds and stored offline, through hardware wallets and paper wallets that are stored in vaults and safety deposit boxes worldwide.In addition, Coinbase states that the remaining portion of cryptocurrency that is stored online is insured, and that in the event of a hack, customers will be entitled to receive any funds lost through this insurance policy.Coinbase offers customers a 2-factor authentication method, which can be through SMS to your phone, or through third party apps such as Google Authenticator or Duo.In addition, Coinbase notifies users if a new device or IP address attempts to access your customer account. However, despite this, if customer accounts are compromised, Coinbase does not accept any liability for funds being lost. For that reason, it is typically recommended that once you have purchased any cryptocurrency on the Coinbase exchange, you store this cryptocurrency offline in a wallet that you control.We have written a separate post which goes into more detail about the security of coinbase.Coinbase Customer SupportCoinbase offers customer support through email, as well as having a Knowledge Base and FAQs page available for customers.Wait times for customer support may vary, with the huge increase in demand for the service in recent months resulting in some delays.However, typical response times tend to be within 24-72 hours. Some users have expressed frustration with receiving “canned responses” that don’t entirely address the issue raised.Supported CountriesCoinbase serves customers in the following countries:Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Jersey, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States.Transaction LimitsTransaction limits vary from country to country, as well as variations as a result of payment methods and verification status. You can view your limits through a link on the account’s limits page. Coinbase also allows users to apply for higher limits, although these applications are not generally applicable to credit card transactions.To apply for higher limits you will need to verify your identity and fully verified US residents can transaction up to $50,000 per week, while verified European customers may have a maximum of $30,000 in their account at any time. Users can check their limits through their account.Transactions Using CryptocurrencyIt is easy to store, send and receive cryptocurrency through Coinbase:To send or store crypto all you need to do is navigate to the Send tab of your account, choose the wallet you wish to send coins from, enter the amount and the public key of the recipient address and click send.To receive cryptocurrency, you need to navigate to the Accounts tab, click on the wallet where you want funds to go and click Receive. Once you’ve clicked receive you will be provided with your account’s wallet address which can be used by the sender to transfer the cryptocurrency to you.Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro ( formally GDAX )In 2015, Coinbase rebranded the exchange element of the company as GDAX and then again in 2018 to “Coinbase Pro”, to separate the ‘trading’ element of the exchange from the more casual consumer platform.You will find that you can avoid Coinbase fees by using GDAX as your buying / trading platform by sending a bank transfer to Coinbase and then using Coinbase Pro for purchasing.All Coinbase customers automatically have an account on Coinbase Pro, you login with the same credentials as you would on the Coinbase website. You can find out more about the two exchanges in our Coinbase vs GDAX comparison post.Coinbase Pro is designed to appeal to more advanced traders who want to know more than just the basics of market fluctuations related to cryptocurrency pairs.There are real-time orderbooks, trade histories, and charting tools. At the same time, the interface on Coinbase Pro is highly intuitive, making it possible for traders to start using the platform right away.If you want to find out more about their Coinbase Pro offering, read our complete review here.Monitoring of AccountsOne of the criticisms from the online community about Coinbase is that has been known to track where its customers send their cryptocurrency, and may ban users from making certain transfers (for example for transactions with gambling sites or darknet purchases).Coinbase is also involved in a running dispute with the IRS where they are fighting requests to hand over all customer’s financial data under a “John Doe” summons.Coinbase DowntimeBack in 2017 when the Bitcoin price was been surging to new heights, seemingly on a daily basis. During these periods of extremely high usage, there has been some downtime for the site and the app which has been causing people to be unable to trade or purchase on the system. Unfortunately these are part of the growing pains of the service which is adding customers at an unprecedented rate.Coinbase has assured it’s customers that they are working on the scaling problem – it is not a huge deal at the moment and has only seen a few hours downtime in total but we thought we’d mention it. This seems to be a common problem across a few exchanges which are all straining under the weight of soaring usage and new people looking to get involved in Cryptocurrencies.Coinbase seems to have this problem under control now but we will have to wait and see when the next bull run happens whether that have added enough capacity to handle the loads.Coinbase CustodyCoinbase also offer custody for cryptocurrency assets for institutions in the form of their custody program, which charges a setup fee of $100,000 and a minimum holding of $10million so you can see it is aimed at banks, hedge funds and other finance institutions who would require such a service.While the program is still in its early phase, they already have their first client and have accepted their first deposit. Custody services are a way for large financial organizations to securely deposit their assets in a way that is insured. This service, the first of its kind, could lead to larger institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies at large.Coinbase and ParadexRecently, Coinbase announced the acquisition of Paradex which is a decentralized exchange for Ethereum ERC-20 tokens, they are hoping to integrate some of this into their offerings and make a wide range of tokens tradeable on their Coinbase Pro platform.This is good news for their customers and indeed any holders of coins which will be listed as this should greatly increase the exposure of these assets to a wider range of people.Instant UK Bank PurchasesCoinbase have recently rolled instant UK bank account purchases, that means you are now able to link any UK bank and enjoy near-instant purchases of their supported currencies.It also means you can deposit and withdraw back to your bank making Coinbase one of the fastest and most efficient ways to convert your coins back to fiat.Before this step, the process took a lot longer and involved international bank transfers and more fees involved in the conversion of cryptocurrencies. If you are based in the UK, this is a huge positive for using Coinbase as your fiat on-ramp and off-ramp.Visit your account settings page and click “Link a New Account” to see the new UK Bank account option.Coinbase BundleAnother new addition to the Coinbase platform is their “Coinbase Bundle”. The bundle is an easy way to buy all 5 cryptocurrencies they currently offer ( BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, ETC).Onside your account you will see the option to purchase the Coinbase bundle, you simply enter an amount you wish to purchase and it will automatically be split between the coins as follows:75.2% Bitcoin15.58% Ethereum6.11% Bitcoin Cash2.33% Litecoin0.78% Ethereum ClassicThis is an easy way to gain exposure to the coins currently available on Coinbase.Coinbase CustodyCoinbase also operates a custody service aimed at financial institutions and segregates and holds digital assets in trust for the benefit of its clients. Coinbase Custody operates as a standalone; independently-capitalized business to Coinbase Inc. and is a fiduciary under New York State Banking Law.In addition, it is fully insured, regulatory compliant, undergoes regular external financial and security audits, and is SOC 2 Type I certified with SOC 2 Type II, and SOC1 Type II certification expected in the near future.Coinbase simplifies the process of purchasing and securely storing high quantities of cryptocurrencies for institutional investors, and there is currently an implementation fee of up to $10,000 and clients are expected to retain a minimum holding balance of $1,000,000.Coinbase StakingThe custody service also allows asset holders to “stake” their tokens, and the team have unveiled Tezos (XTZ) staking for their clients, and the ability to participate in staking allows institutions to securely participate in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based projects that reward parties for helping to secure the blockchain network by staking their assets.Client assets are held in segregated cold storage, and Coinbase Custody runs its own nodes and validators and operates first class, institutional grade security and infrastructure standards. In addition to staking, Coinbase Custody will soon introduce governance support for the Maker (MKR) protocol, with Maker and Tezos voting expected to be integrated in Q2, 2019.Key Features:Security – Coinbase Custody uses 100% offline, segregated storage for all client funds, and posts all bond requirements for its stakers.Compliant – Coinbase Custody is a fiduciary and qualified custodian and offers staking services as a non-discretionary fiduciary activity to its clients.Simplicity – Clients can enjoy simple deposit, withdrawal, reporting and consensus features across all assets on Coinbase Custody.OTC TradingCoinbase Custody is also integrated with Coinbase’s OTC desk and the vertically-integrated custody service provides clients with access to instant and anonymous liquidity. The Custody team completed its first OTC trade directly out of cold storage in March, and the OTC desk is agency-only, with all counterparties required to adhere to robust KYC and AML policies.However, with Coinbase acting as an intermediary, the anonymity of the involved counterparties is preserved whilst guaranteeing settlement.Custody clients can leverage the OTC desk to price and confirm trades before moving funds, and the OTC and Custody client service teams work together to simplify the entire process. Any clients initiating positions can buy OTC and settle assets directly into Custody.Key Features:Quick trading for offline fundsAgency-only OTC desk provides anonymous access to trusted counterpartiesThe OTC and Custody client service teams provide a seamless process from pricing risk through to trade settlementThe USDC StablecoinCoinbase also supports the USDC currency (USD Coin), an ERC-20 token and “stablecoin” with a price pegged to the price of the US Dollar. As a result, holders of the coin will always be able to redeem 1 USD Coin for US$1.00 and protect themselves from the volatility of holding digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.USDC is minted by Centre, a consortium that collectively holds US$1.00 for every single USDC with the funds being held in a consistently monitored and audited bank account. The stablecoins are issued by regulated and licensed financial institutions that maintain full reserves of the equivalent fiat currency, and these issuers are required to report their USD reserve holdings on a regular basis with Grant Thornton LLP producing monthly reports on these holdings.As a result, USDC is fully transparent and the project works within US money transmission laws, and the CENTRE open source technology project received early stage financial contributions from Circle and Coinbase, helping it to develop and it remains responsible for governing the currency and connecting its growing body of users and network of various stakeholders.In addition to being supported by Coinbase and Coinbase Pro, USDC is also tradable on leading exchanges such as Binance, Bitfinex, Kucoin, OKEx, and Poloniex. As an ERC-20 token is also integrates with a variety of wallets, and can be used on decentralized platforms such as Bitpay, BlockFi, Dharma, Nexo, Melonport, and Loom.How to earn free crypto with CoinbaseAs part of its mission to create an open financial system, and make blockchain technology more accessible, the exchange operates the Coinbase Earn learning portal which allows users to earn cryptocurrencies, while learning about them at the same time.Coinbase Earn aims to incentivize users to develop a deeper understanding of a digital asset, as well as its underlying technology, and does this by making easy to consume, educational content readily available.Signup for Coinbase EarnVerified users are able to earn crypto by completing a series of educational tasks such as watching videos, and filling out quizzes, and the initiative is open to eligible individuals located across the globe.In addition to watching tutorials and answering quiz questions, users are also rewarded for sharing their unique referral links, and inviting other eligible friends to complete the lessons.It’s currently possible to take courses on digital currencies such as Stellar Lumens (XLM), Zcash (ZEC), Basic Attention Token (BAT), and 0x (ZRX) with further currencies expected to be added in the future.The Coinbase Wallet appThe Coinbase Wallet is a user controlled non-custodial digital currency wallet and decentralized app (dApp) browser.Here, the private keys (that represent ownership of digital asset) are stored directly on your device and not held centrally on an exchange.

14,Blockonomi,Bybit Debuts World Series of Trading Contest with 200 BTC Prize Pot,Osato Avan-Nomayo,1594115972.0,"Bybit — a Singapore-based crypto derivatives exchange — is introducing a new contest for traders called the World Series of Trading (WSOT). The competition is the latest in the platform’s catalog of incentivized games targeted at getting customers to hone their strategies while standing the chance to win prizes.Meanwhile, the crypto derivatives scene continues to expand with the competition among exchanges intensifying. Platforms that dominated the market in years past are seeing their rivals command a greater market share with traders looking for services that offer the most value.WSOT: Latest Addition to Games CalendarAccording to a press release shared with Blockonomi on Monday (July 6, 2020), Bybit is set to launch the WSOT event for crypto derivatives traders from across the world. The WSOT competition will be held twice a year with a prize pool of 200 BTC (~$1.86M) in this first edition.As part of the press statement, the crypto derivatives exchange also revealed that participants will enjoy a 20% trading fee discount and Tether (USDT) bonuses totaling $9,400. The competition will reportedly take place between August 10 and August 31 with pre-registration now available until the end of July.Commenting on the need for the WSOT, Bybit CEO ben Zhou remarked:“The World Series of Trading will be the main tournament of Bybit Games and the crypto trading world. We at Bybit believe in the importance of empowering traders who embody the prowess and passion for crypto trading. This revolutionary event aims to champion the spirit of competition and fair play, and cultivate camaraderie between crypto derivatives traders from all over the world to create positive changes in the crypto space.”The WSOT is the latest entry in the Bybit games catalog and will see popular names in the crypto trading scene as well as poker legends taking part. According to the crypto derivatives exchange, the competition will emphasize the spirit of transparency and fair play. As such, participant rankings in the tournament will be based on profit vs. loss percentages to even out the playing field.Bybit Games Incentivizing Crypto Derivatives TradersBybit will be hoping that WSOT ends up being an even bigger success than BTC Brawl. Back in November 2019, Bybit debuted its multinational crypto derivatives trading contest which saw over 7,000 traders competing for the 100 BTC prize pool.At the time, the contest was open to traders with a minimum of 0.05 BTC at the time. The competition came at a period when Bybit had crossed $4B in daily trading volume less than a year after beginning its operation. Bybit’s success has been in keeping with the crypto derivatives trading explosion see in Singapore.As of the time of writing, open interest on Bitcoin (BTC) futures on Bybit stands at about $320 million based on data from crypto analytics platform Skew. Bybit is currently one of the largest crypto derivatives trading services in the worldDaily trading volume for BTC futures on Bybit is about $715 million with total trading volume steadily growing since the start of July. Open interest is also on the rise, crossing the $350M mark.Crypto derivatives trading continues to gain prominence with the market expanding across several countries. Platforms are increasingly competing to offer the best futures, options, perpetual contracts and other trading instruments to customers. Earlier in June, Bybit enabled crypto purchases via debit and credit cards to offer faster fiat on-ramps for its customers.As previously reported by Blockonomi, the crypto derivatives trading volume for Q1 2020 topped $2T which was almost a quarter of the $8.8T recorded for the total crypto market during the period.    1,513"
15,Blockonomi,"Land, Games, Art, Oh My! An Intro Guide to the Rising NFT Ecosystem on Ethereum",William M. Peaster,1594030398.0,"Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is all the rage in Ethereum’s nook of the cryptoeconomy lately thanks to the recent memetic rise of “yield farming,” i.e. earning returns for putting your money to use in DeFi platforms.Yet there’s another hot Ethereum sector that’s also been picking up lots of steam this year, and it’s the NFT sector.Most folks who are crypto-savvy but don’t know much about NFTs, which go by names like non-fungible tokens, nifties, or crypto collectibles, may recognize the term from the CryptoKitties craze in late 2017, when Ethereum users invested in the franchise’s digital kitties in droves.Since then, the NFT arena has exploded in activity, and 2020 has been something of a boom year for the scene. That’s evidenced by the fact the NFT market just reached its first $100 million in total sales in July 2020.It’s an impressive early milestone that suggests the sky could be the limit from here for NFTs. To get a better sense of what this milestone means going forward, let’s dig into the basics of NFTs and just how far they’ve come so far.The NFTs 101Contents1 The NFTs 1012 OGs: CryptoPunks & CryptoKitties3 NFT Sales: $100 Million4 Early Types of NFTs5 Toward the Mainstream6 Interesting Follows7 ConclusionWhat makes an NFT an NFT?Let’s put it this way: there are fungible assets and non-fungible assets. Fungible assets are interchangeable with each other. $1 is effectively indistinguishable from any other $1, and the same is true for 1 BTC compared against another 1 BTC.Conversely, non-fungible assets are things like artworks or land that are readily distinguishable. Non-fungible tokens, then, are blockchain-powered digital assets that are verifiably scarce and unique.As Ethereum is the most popular platform for minting NFTs to date, the most popular NFT standard so far is Ethereum’s ERC721 specification, which was first published in January 2018. ERC721 tokens have become the most widely used NFTs ever since.OGs: CryptoPunks & CryptoKittiesYou can draw a straight line from where the NFT economy is today to two of the arena’s earliest hits, CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties.CryptoPunks, which rolled onto the scene in early 2017, are collectible pixel characters that are capped at 10,000 units, all of which are visually unique to one another. These CryptoPunks were free at first, but collectors descended into a frenzy around the tokens after Mashable published a story on the project.That spike of interest gave the NFT ecosystem inertia that continues to this day. The inertia was meaningful enough that CryptoPunks remain in vogue now, with some selling for as high as 60 ETH earlier this year.Another key early NFT enterprise was CryptoKitties, which allowed players to breed and trade unique (and adorable) digital kitties. The project smashed through millions of dollars worth of sales in short order, and showed that secondary markets around NFTs were viable.With all that said, CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties showed what was possible early on and inspired dozens of projects in their wake. Developers, entrepreneurs, and collectors have been building up the NFT economy ever since.NFT Sales: $100 MillionAccording to NFT market history site NonFungible, the all-time USD volume of NFT sales on Ethereum was over $99.5 million at the time of this article’s writing. That means the $100 million milestone is all but certain to be topped in a matter of days.Zooming out, then, it’s incredible how far the NFT economy has come so fast. As NFT expert and Polynexus Capital partner Andrew Steinwold noted in a recent issue of Bankless, this economy is practically a newborn.“With December 2017 as our starting point, the NFT market has only been around for ~2.5 years, an extremely small amount of time compared to bitcoin (11 years) or traditional markets (hundreds of years),” Steinwold said.Accordingly, the $100 million mark shows that NFTs projects really are onto something and are winning users over, even if things are still early and small relatively speaking.Early Types of NFTsPeople will be experimenting with NFTs for years to come, so the dust is hardly settled with regard to what kinds of NFTs can be built. Yet there have been some dominant types so far. The aforementioned Andrew Steinwold slots these types as follows:Collectibles (think CryptoKitties and CryptoPunks)Virtual worlds (think VR parcels in Cryptovoxels and Decentraland)Game assets (like Gods Unchained trading cards or Axie Infinity creatures)Cryptoart (as seen on platforms like SuperRare and Async Art)Culture tokens (e.g. virtual clothes for Cryptovoxels or a tokenized music album)Other (e.g. event tickets, memberships, real-world items, professional services)Each of these NFT types is rife with unique possibilities. You can “breed” CryptoKitties to create new ones. You can host virtual events in Cryptovoxels, like the WIP Meetup. You can earn tokens as you battle your way through Axie Infinity, display your latest programmable Async Art piece on your Apple TV, and much more. And again, this arena’s just beginning. A New Wrinkle for Ethereum DeFi: Loans Backed by Crypto CollectiblesToward the MainstreamCryptoKitties had a flash of breakout success in 2017, but the NFT scene and Ethereum have come along way since and are much better prepared to start making serious inroads to the mainstream.Unquestionably, challenges remain. Ethereum’s general user experience (UX) is often cited as problematic, but this dynamic is getting better all the while with the rise of user-friendly smart wallets like Argent.Another pain point is the acutely high transaction prices Ethereum has been facing lately.The good news is that Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling solution ecosystem has never been more vibrant than it is today, and several scaling projects therein are on the cusp of more widespread deployments. As these efforts continue to roll out, the infrastructure for mainstream adoption falls into place.With that said, NFT enterprises will have to keep building stuff people want, too. Some of these recent efforts have been directly catered to mainstream interests like professional sports in the interest of piquing regular folks’ attention.Consider the example of Sorare, which is a fantasy football game that lets you collect, field, and trade tokenized versions of some of Europe’s biggest football stars. The game’s been on fire in the NFT sector in recent days, as evidenced by the fact it’s currently the top NFT project by volume on the week per NonFungible. It’s projects like this that are angling NFTs toward the masses as we speak, and they’re worth watching accordingly.Interesting FollowsThere are no shortage of great minds around the NFT space, so sometimes the hard part is keeping up with everyone’s output. But there are some individuals who definitely make the shortlist for NFT experts you may want to have on your radar. They include:Andrew Steinwold (Polynexus Capital, Zima Red)Jeffrey Zirlin (Axie Infinity co-founder)Josie Bellini (cryptoartist)Jason Bailey (Artnome founder)Jake Brukhman (CoinFund founder, edition1art)hex6c (Data scientist, cryptoartist)Hackatao (cryptoartist)ConclusionNow that $100 million in NFT sales has been topped, the next big round milestone will be $1 billion in sales.There’s no telling when that could happen, but there’s a palpable feeling around the ecosystem that NFTs are only just beginning to ramp up. $1 billion and beyond seems all but inevitable at this point.If you’re interested in learning more or even jumping in and trying NFTs for the first time, I recommend NonFungible as an analytics resource and OpenSea as an excellent all-around NFT marketplace. Try these sites out for fun, and you may just end up sticking around for a while!    1,760"
16,Blockonomi,How Ethereum Is Changing the World & Pointing to a Brighter Future,William M. Peaster,1593419382.0,"Some people point out that the cryptoeconomy is still relatively small, so that even its biggest happenings are still just tempests in a teapot.I disagree with this viewpoint, particularly where Ethereum is concerned. Why? Because if you look closely, Ethereum is already powering amazing, and in many cases unprecedented, solutions and services in the here and now.The leading smart contract platform is a new kind of public infrastructure, and its ecosystem has come far enough along now that it seems, at least to me, all but inevitable that this infrastructure will be more widely adopted in the years ahead.That’s because if Ethereum is so useful now, it should be that much more useful as time goes on. So to get a better sense of why Ethereum is already a game-changer in the world today, let’s survey the major stars in the platform’s metaphorical constellation.Finance for AnyoneContents1 Finance for Anyone2 Decentralized Exchanges3 Digital Cooperatives4 Cheap International Payments5 Open-Source Funding Innovations6 Social Money Made Easy7 Digital Collectibles8 VR Real Estate Markets9 Automated Artist Royalties10 Play to Earn Gaming11 Capital of Cutting-Edge Blockchain Tech12 ConclusionWith an Ethereum address, anyone in the world can save, invest, borrow, lend, and transact with anyone around the globe that also has an Ethereum address.The best part of this dynamic? All these activities are powered by a decentralized blockchain rather than by a centralized company that has its own whims and regulatory pressures. PayPal may shutter your account for this or that reason, but Ethereum can’t.Accordingly, Ethereum offers an increasingly globalized world a powerful alternative financial system that has self-sovereignty at its heart.Decentralized ExchangesCentralized crypto exchanges enforce KYC and control your funds. Decentralized exchanges do neither of these things, which is big reason that Ethereum’s DEX scene has exploded so far in 2020.It’s empowering to be able to trade permissionlessly and around the clock, and recent growth in the DEX sector proves that. Take the case of Uniswap, the Ethereum community’s darling DEX. Uniswap creator Hayden Adams said this month that Uniswap’s volume stands to be higher in June 2020 than it was in all of 2019.📶 A bit lost in the noise, decentralized trading is *exploding* right now🦄 @UniswapProtocol volume alone is on track for ~$400M this month, more than all of 2019 combined💸 Annualized, that's ~$4.8B in trading volume and ~$14.4M in liquidity provider fees pic.twitter.com/aOaRyaNgzB— Hayden Adams 🦄 (@haydenzadams) June 25, 2020Moreover, Ethereum’s DEXes are all the while becoming more efficient and cheaper, to the point that they are now coming to rival their centralized exchange counterparts.Digital CooperativesDigital cooperatives stand to gain a lot more traction going forward thanks to rise of a teeming scene of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) atop Ethereum over the last year and a half.There are DAOs for community coordination (MolochDAO, MetaCartel), for venture investing (The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures), esports (MetaClan), professional services (Raid Guild), and much more.These groups are early trailblazers that are showing new types of group coordination are possible thanks to Ethereum.Cheap International PaymentsThe traditional financial world has no shortage of mainstream payments rails. But these rails are centralized, regional, and prone to middleman fees all along the way.The result, then, is that traditional payments can be quite expensive. If you want to send a few thousand dollars through PayPal, the payments giant is going to eat up a non-trivial portion of the sum with a transfer fee.Contrast this with Ethereum, which can power a $5 payment or a $5 billion payment anywhere in the world for just a few cents. And as Ethereum’s ecosystem advances technologically, it’ll only become cheaper to transact through the platform, too.Open-Source Funding InnovationsFunding open-source efforts was a problem before Ethereum ever existed. But the platform has given rise to pioneering efforts, like Gitcoin Grants, that could change the way the world looks at open-source funding in the years ahead.For instance, Gitcoin Grants relies on quadratic funding, a donation mechanism that helps to match donated funds in a democratic manner. The decentralized service has been a big hit when it comes to allowing Ethereum projects to get more funding, and it’ll surely continue to rise in popularity.Social Money Made EasyEthereum makes tokenizing anything easy. This reality has given rise to “social money,” where individuals and creators can launch personal tokens that give them ways to monetize content like never before. It also gives fans a way to become involved stakeholders in people of interest.In this field, Roll — the “new standard in social money” — is an early innovator. They’ve made social money easy to embrace this early on, so expect more folks to come around to the sector as the cryptoeconomy continues to grow.Digital CollectiblesCollectibles can now be programmable thanks to Ethereum, and this possibility has led to a blooming digital collectibles ecosystem on the smart contract platform. Where collectibles were once illiquid, they’re now made liquid on Ethereum.These collectibles, or NFTs for non-fungible tokens, appeared on Ethereum through the likes of CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties in 2017.Years later, and there are dozens of “nifties” projects whose collectibles will live on the Ethereum blockchain forever, all while being provably scarce and theft-resistant. A new era of digital collecting seemingly lies ahead, then.VR Real Estate MarketsEthereum is also home to multiple notable virtual reality worlds, like Cryptovoxels, Decentraland, The Sandbox, and more. These community hubs are growing fast, too. Cryptovoxels: Inside One of the Coolest Virtual World Projects on EthereumWhat’s great is that these worlds are already being used to host VR events, showcase artists’ NFTs, exhibit games, and beyond, and all this potential has Ethereum’s VR real estate market booming lately. Builders and flippers have a new way to enterprise accordingly.Automated Artist RoyaltiesEthereum’s rising digital art marketplaces have been early gems for the platform, and one amazing thing they offer — and that Ethereum offers generally — is automated royalty payments to artists for secondary sales.Why’s this big? Because there’s no analogue in the traditional art world, where artists typically never receive royalties for secondary sales at all and gallery payments can take weeks. Blockchain & Art: How this Technology is Affecting an Age Old IndustryOn Ethereum, every time an artist’s NFT is sold, a smart contract can automatically send the creator a portion of the sale. With a 10% royalty in place, an artist would receive 0.1 ETH for a secondary sale of 1 ETH, for example. This is a huge perk for creators, and I expect it become very popular in the future.Play to Earn GamingEthereum is already great now because it’s also proving that games can give their users new revenue streams.Specifically, a play-to-earn movement has arisen on Ethereum in recent months, and it’s all about rewarding and empowering players. There’s Axie Infinity, where you can grind through battles to earn Small Love Potion (SLP) tokens that can be sold, or the trading card game Gods Unchained, where you can sell gained cards for a profit.Capital of Cutting-Edge Blockchain TechAnother major reason not to sleep on Ethereum over the next decade? It’s currently home to the most next-gen solutions in the entire blockchain arena.For instance, the ecosystem’s oracle tech scene (Chainlink, Augur, Maker) is currently most teeming atop Ethereum. There are more promising layer-two scaling solutions (Fuel, Loopring, StarkEx) building on Ethereum than anywhere else. And Ethereum’s base layer will eventually get an advanced upgrade to its scaling powers, too, once the platform embraces sharding in Ethereum 2.0.ConclusionEthereum is on the verge of turning 5 years old, and things are only just beginning to get extremely interesting for the platform. If this is how far the project can come in half a decade, imagine what it will look like 2 decades from now?A lot can happen between now and then, and Ethereum still faces no shortage of challenges across the board. But it’s unquestionable that there’s plenty of reasons to be excited about Ethereum now and where it’s going.    1,681"
17,Blockonomi,Best Cryptocurrency Lending Platforms: Guide to Crypto-Backed Loans,Daniel Dob,1593162631.0,"Despite popular knowledge, trading cryptocurrencies is not the best and only way to earn a profit by leveraging your current holdings.Rather, the market offers several other investment tools, such as digital currency lending, which enables borrowers and lenders to transact money between one another in an ecosystem that ensures good interest rates, alongside a sufficient degree of safety.As the cryptocurrency market continues to develop, traditional financial instruments are now making their way onto this emerging market.As such, crypto users can now engage in margin lending, crypto-to-crypto lending, and crypto-to-fiat lending, for the purpose of either earning an interest rate on coins that are being lent out, or to get access to fiat/crypto for investments, larger-scale purchases, or day-to-day expenses.This article will focus on highlighting the main aspects worth taking into consideration when dealing with the crypto lending market, while also featuring an in-depth analysis of the main digital currency lending platforms available on the market.How Crypto Lending WorksContents1 How Crypto Lending Works2 Top Crypto Lending Platforms2.1 Nexo2.1.1 Lending features2.1.2 Interest2.1.3 Ease of use2.1.4 Supported coins2.2 BlockFi2.2.1 Lending features2.2.2 Interest2.2.3 Ease of use2.2.4 Supported coins2.3 CoinLoan.io2.3.1 Lending features2.3.2 Interest2.3.3 Ease of use2.3.4 Supported coins2.4 YouHODLER2.4.1 Lending features2.4.2 Interest2.4.3 Ease of use2.4.4 Supported coins2.5 Crypto.com2.5.1 Lending features2.5.2 Interest2.5.3 Ease of use2.5.4 Supported coins2.6 Celsius.Network2.6.1 Lending features2.6.2 Interest2.6.3 Ease of use2.6.4 Supported coins3 Bottom LIneThe crypto lending process is straightforward on most platforms offering this service. Lenders will deposit part of their crypto holdings on the platform. The coins are then made available to borrowers at a pre-set interest rate.Borrowers can then create an account and take on a loan for a specific period of time. Once the lending time has expired, the borrower will return the funds and pay an interest rate on top for the service.To ensure trustworthiness and help mitigate risks such as borrowers being unable to pay back their loans, most crypto lending platforms implement guarantees or set up collateral or loan backing systems.Most borrowers utilize such services for two reasons: day-to-day expenses or margin trading. While day-to-day expenses are pretty self-explanatory (a process that is prevalent in the traditional financial market), margin trading entails the use of borrowed funds in order to make riskier and higher-value trades.Thus, in case a proper trading decision was taken, the trader will receive a higher profit. In the case of a bad deal, the trader will have to pay for the losses out of their own pocket, while ensuring that the loan is paid back.There are several advantages to crypto lending. These include:Extremely low transaction feesNo need to fulfill excessive bank conditionsReduced bureaucracyNo need for a bank accountDiversified loansVery few limits on which services can be used based on factors such as nationality or citizenshipQuick approval times.On the other hand, there are also several risks associated with crypto lending. These include:Lending platform safetyA higher default rate on repayments when compared to fiatThe inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, which might entail that debtors pay back considerably more than they borrowed, whereas lenders may sometimes lose profits due to excessive volatility.Top Crypto Lending PlatformsWithout further ado, here is our in-depth analysis of the market’s most popular cryptocurrency lending platforms:NexoAt this point in time, Nexo is regarded as one of the most popular crypto lending companies active on the market. According to its website, Nexo has processed over $700 million-worth of transactions, for more than 200,000 users.Thanks to its compliance efforts, it is available in over 300 jurisdictions, while supporting more than 45 fiat currencies. $1+ billion worth of instant crypto loan requests were processed during its 10 years of online lending.The company’s vision entails identifying and solving a variety of inefficiencies that are apparent on the lending market, through the use of blockchain and other innovative technologies.Lending featuresNexo offers an instant crypto credit line, which allows users to borrow money without needing to go through a credit check, by putting their cryptocurrency up as collateral.Nexo’s business model embraces the use of mechanisms meant to help unlock the value of digital assets while retaining ownership of crypto through low-cost and tax-efficient credit lines. Quick access to cash is provided thanks to the implementation of blockchain technology, which also ensures operational safety for both lenders and borrowers, since lending is carried out through blockchain-based smart loan contracts. Nexo has a handy loan calculatorNexo also offers a credit card, which allows debtors to easily access their credit line anywhere in the world. The Nexo card can be used to make ATM withdrawals or to directly pay for products & services at online and offline retailers. Free unlimited virtual cards are offered, alongside cashback on all purchases. At the time of writing, the Nexo card does not entail FX, monthly or annual account management fees apart from the loan’s interest rate. Users will have to pay an interest rate starting from 5.9% APR.InterestNexo is also a great solution for investors. The crypto lending platform allows users to earn 8% interest on EUR, USD and GBP deposits, which are 100% asset-backed. Thus, investors are offered the opportunity to earn a high-yield passive income on their savings.Access to funds is instant, unlike most traditional banks and many alternative lending platforms. Additionally, Nexo features a daily compounded interest on all deposits, alongside custodial insurance of up to $100 million on each deposit.Interest rates are also available on stablecoins, such as USDT, TUSD, USDC, PAX, and SAI.Ease of useThe lending process is very straight-forward: Borrowers must transfer a specific amount of crypto to their NexoOracle account (bound to serve as collateral).

Some people just want to grab a few tokens and hold onto them for the long term. If you are looking to make a long-term investment in cryptos, then buying a few with a credit or debit card and storing them on a secure wallet is fine.The fees that you pay to buy and transfer cryptos won’t really matter in the grand scheme, as your expectation for price movements is far higher than a few percent. If you are looking to trade cryptos actively, then it is far more important to look into the fees that an exchange charges.Crypto only exchanges can have extremely low rates, and some also offer token pairs that are difficult to find elsewhere.BinanceBinance have grown rapidly into one of the world’s most used crypto exchanges.

In addition to having a large daily turnover and deep liquidity, Poloniex was taken over by Circle, which is backed in part by investment bank Goldman Sachs.While it is a great exchange that offers crypto traders a lot, Poloniex isn’t going to be right for everyone. It is strictly a crypto-only exchange that doesn’t deal with fiat currency at all. That means that you can only fund it with cryptos, not bank transfers or any kind of credit or debit card.Poloniex does offer its clients Tether, which is a stablecoin that is tied to the US dollar. It isn’t a perfect system, and the value of Tether does vary from day to day. If fiat currency isn’t a concern, and you are happy to deal solely in cryptocurrencies, Poloniex is one of the best exchanges out there to learn more about.On the plus side, Poloniex was the first crypto exchange to be regulated by the SEC and FINRA. The USA is one of the strictest countries when it comes to financial regulations, and that puts Poloniex a step above offshore exchanges that have far less regulatory oversight to deal with.The trading platform that Poloniex offers its clients is geared toward experienced traders, and it might not be a perfect fit for everyone. Its fee structure is extremely competitive, and the exchange offers deep liquidity and a huge range of tokens.If you would like to learn more about Poloniex, have a look at this in-depth review (LINK).HADAXHADAX is an interesting idea from Huobi. If cryptos are the wild west of the financial world, HADAX is the unknown frontier of the crypto wilderness. Huobi created the platform to allow the trade of smaller tokens, which can be extremely volatile.If you are looking for an exchange to trade in major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH or XRP, HADAX probably isn’t the exchange for you. The platform was set up to allow its users to vote on which tokens should be listed via HT tokens, which makes the listing process both decentralized and autonomous.HADAX doesn’t deal in fiat currency, and will only accept deposits in cryptos. On the plus side deposits are accepted with no charge, and the trading fees on the platform are low. If you are looking to get into some extremely speculative digital assets, HADAX could be worth a look.Finding Other ExchangesBefore jumping on any exchange that you come across selling bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, it’s vital that you do your due diligence pertaining to the platform. Make sure that the platform you are looking to use has a good and trusted reputation, and read reviews.There are many scammers out there, as well as shady exchanges. It is not uncommon for unscrupulous bitcoin exchanges to steal their users’ credit card information and other sensitive data.If you are looking for other options for the purchase of Bitcoin, you are in luck. There are many ways to get Bitcoin if you don’t want to share much of your personal data online, though you will need to jump though a few hoops to make the deal happen.Feel Like Using Cash to Buy Bitcoin?One of the biggest selling points for Bitcoin was its near total anonymity. Now that most exchanges where you can buy and trade cryptos are going to ask for some form of ID verification (especially if you want to buy your cryptos with fiat currency), it is much harder to get into Bitcoin without sharing personal information.While it is nearly impossible to buy Bitcoins without leaving some sort of transactional evidence behind, there are options for people that want to buy cryptos with cash. Here are a few ways you can go right from cash into cryptocurrency, as long as you are willing to walk the path less traveled.Buy at a Bitcoin ATMBitcoin ATMs have been installed in many places, especially in North America and the EU. While turning a bunch of cash into Bitcoin with crypto ATMs isn’t going to be easy, they can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptos with relative anonymity.The first major downside of buying Bitcoin in person is that most crypto ATMs have a limit on how much can be bought at one time. If you only want to pick up a few hundred dollars or euros worth of BTC or ETH they could be a good option, but stashing tens of thousands of dollars away on the sly with crypto ATMs isn’t going to be easy.Additionally, there are almost certainly going to be people and cameras around wherever a crypto ATM is located. The people working at the store will probably remember that you show up every few days with a stack of cash to buy cryptos, or at the very least a security camera will keep a record of it.While certainly not a perfect solution for everyone, Bitcoin ATMs are a viable options to turn your cash directly into cryptos. If there are a lot of them where you live, you might be able to do a few laps around the metro area and pick up an appreciable amount of crypto on the DL.LocalBitcoinsLocalBitcoins is an interesting platform. Started in 2012 in Finland as an easy way for people to trade Bitcoin on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis, it remains a great tool for people that want to bypass the cryptos exchanges.The process of using LocalBitcoins is pretty simple. All you have to do is open an account, and provide some basic personal information. There are a number of ways to pay for the Bitcoins, including ‘cash in the mail’, which opens up a whole range of bartering options.Remember, LocalBitcoins is a P2P exchange, so it is important to make sure and research the counterparty you are considering a trade with. Make sure they have done a lot of deals, and haven’t raised any red flags with previous clients.The fees that LocalBitcoins charges are generally quite low, and are usually only applied to the person that took out the advert. On the flip side, the rate that Bitcoins are sold at on the platform tends to be above market rate, and the amount of liquidity if obviously much lower than a crypto exchange.If you want to learn more about LocalBitcoins, check out our full review here.Visit LocalBitcoinsWrapping up – Final ThoughtsWhile there certainly are risks involved with purchasing bitcoins from exchanges using your bank cards, it’s also one of the easiest ways to acquire this cryptocurrency.In fact, it is comparable to how regular shopping is done online. However, buying bitcoins with credit and debit cards usually entails high fees and can leave buyers exposed to risk. Fees for purchases made with bank accounts are generally lower.Keep in mind that bitcoin purchases on exchanges with stolen credit or debit cards are impossible due to the verification processes that exchanges have put in place to protect buyers. Anonymous purchases of bitcoins are also impossible due to the verification processes.Unfortunately, pre-loaded debit or credit cards don’t work on most popular exchanges. If you are in possession of a prepaid debit or credit card, you may have to refer to LocalBitcoins to purchase bitcoins.Individuals should devote a lot of time to researching exchanges and platforms before buying any bitcoins. Due to the verification processes implemented on most, it would be truly terrible to have your personal information or government ID fall into the hands of some scammers or shady platform.It’s also highly recommended that users transfer their bitcoins from exchange platforms directly to their personal bitcoin wallets to keep acquired assets safe from theft.Keep in mind that you aren’t limited to using one exchange. This means you can own accounts on all of the reputable exchanges, like Coinbase, BitPanda, CoinMama, LocalBitcoins, CEX.io and Changelly. This is perfect for users who feel restricted by exchange platform transaction limits.    59,567"

20,Blockonomi,Exploring the Intersection of Blockchain & Crowdfunding,William M. Peaster,1592910589.0,"Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are, simply put, a new kind of public infrastructure.Such platforms are not a panacea technology, but they can open up many new kinds of possibilities across many industries, not least among these industries being the traditional finance sector.That’s because blockchains are “slow and auditable computer networks we can trust” and which are “good for computing auditable and trustworthy transactions,” Zenith Ventures’s Richard Burton recently aptly explained.To that, I’d note that public blockchains make it possible to create new kinds of digital assets as well and thus pave the way for new avenues of global, permissionless, and frictionless commerce.Accordingly, the fledgling blockchain-powered “Open Finance” upswell may become increasingly poised to influence — or even break down — the walled gardens of traditional finance for decades to come, not unlike how the internet became a commercial game changer around the turn of the century.With all that said, the aforementioned Burton perceptibly added  that it’s precisely the “things that we want to be slow and auditable [that] are pretty important,” like “Money creation, corporate governance, and contract enforcement,” and it’s such operations that blockchains are tailored for.So, blockchains are unique in design and are uniquely suited to automate and streamline certain activities. These dynamics make the tech particularly well positioned to power innovation around the rising internet-based crowdfunding arena.Why? Because crowdfunding neatly entails a trifecta of things that blockchains are good for: asset creation, corporate governance, and contract enforcement.Like Blockchain, Internet Crowdfunding Relatively NewContents1 Like Blockchain, Internet Crowdfunding Relatively New2 The Smart Contract Factor3 Underdog Blockchain Projects Turn to Crowdfunding, Too4 Some Crowdfunding Platforms Already Eye On-Chain Operations5 ICOs and IEOs: a Novel Form of Crowdfunding6 The DAO & Newer Experiments7 MolochDAO8 Laws Still Developing Around Blockchain and Crowdfunding9 Big Questions Ahead of Further AdoptionDubbed as a type of alternative finance, internet crowdfunding is a relatively new addition to the mainstream.Crowdfunding, which involves startups, projects, or individuals raising small amounts of money from many people over the internet, really began picking up steam between 2008 and 2010 when the first popular crowdfunding platforms launched, namely Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and IndieGoGo.Ever since then, the sector has exploded as new crowdfunding platforms have risen all around the world across a variety of fields and niches. In that span, upstart enterprises have collectively raised billions of dollars to fund their operations in a faster and leaner manner than more traditional avenues could afford.As such, crowdfunding has really only started coming into its own over this last decade, a reality that’s also been true of blockchains since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009.In this way, both the crowdfunding and blockchain spaces are still maturing and offer “alternatives” to currently available mainstream options. Moreover, smart contract platforms like Ethereum may prove pivotal in unlocking new unlock new kinds of crowdfunding possibilities altogether.Fundrise, Part of the new breed of niche-Crowdfunding PlatformsThe Smart Contract FactorBy far, Ethereum is currently the most popular and most widely used smart contract platform. And that’s because Ethereum was the first platform to bring smart contract functionalities to the public, and the project’s ecosystem has maintained the ensuing momentum ever since.But what exactly is a smart contract, you ask?Think of a platform like Ethereum like a decentralized world computer, powered not by one or a few sources but by many stakeholders. This computer can be used to compute the functions of apps or the existence of digital assets, which are governed by smart contracts.In short, a smart contract is a self-executing digital contract. If certain conditions are met, the contract executes according to its internal logic — no manual intervention required.This design allows for the creation of programmable money and programmable assets, which are unprecedented innovations in the history of finance. Furthermore, smart contracts can be a powerful disinter-mediating force that mitigate the need for middlemen and excessive fees in transactions, or at least help intermediaries streamline and customize transactions as these programmed digital contracts execute on their own.In the context of crowdfunding then, the smart contract possibilities seem endless.Consider this example: a crowdfunded real estate project issues special digital tokens as a security to investors; in order to maintain regulatory compliance, the token’s smart contract “whitelists” addresses that have passed “Know Your Customer” processes, meaning only compliant users can hold the token. The benefit is that much of this hypothetical process would be automated by neutral public infrastructure, e.g. Ethereum.Such tokens could then be traded more liquidly than ever in paperless fashion on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like Uniswap without raising the ire of regulators, as only compliant users — with fully auditable transaction histories — would have access to the token’s liquidity. And this is just one hypothetical scenario. With programmable investments, much is possible.Relatedly, a European Crowdfunding Association (ECN) report earlier this year found that blockchain and associated innovations could become game changers in the crowdfunding industry going forward:“Blockchain and [distributed ledger platforms], in general, can drive change in the financial services by introducing transparency, simplification and efficiency. The key benefits of these new technologies are related to their ability to create trust in a distributed system, increase efficiency in real-time or near real-time reporting of transactions, and support high resilience.”Underdog Blockchain Projects Turn to Crowdfunding, TooInternet crowdfunding is still considered alternative finance, so it’s still an insurgent industry that is in the middle of earning its reputation.The blockchain arena is in a similar boat, insofar as it has generated buzz while at the same time many influential people still don’t take it seriously.With that said, many crowdfunding platforms cater to making it easier for new projects to raise money than if they were to go through traditional venues, a reality that has made these fledgling services a growing funding option of choice among blockchain-centric projects looking to raise capital without going the initial coin offering (ICO) route — a path that is more regulatorily onerous in most jurisdictions around the world.For example, in November 2019 the AI-managed cryptocurrency portfolio Ember Fund announced plans to raise up to $1 million USD on the crowdfunding platform Republic. Expect more ventures like this to come in the years ahead.Some Crowdfunding Platforms Already Eye On-Chain OperationsThe melding of blockchain tech with crowdfunding companies isn’t just theoretical — some startups have already pushed ahead on putting the innovative combination work.For instance, consider the case of Pledgecamp, which hails itself as the “future of crowdfunding” via “blockhain protected investments.” This platform uses smart contracts and a dual-token system to facilitate a crowdfunding service underpinned by blockchain.“Blockchain allows strangers across the world to engage in complicated financial transactions within a programmable framework of trust,” the Pledgecamp team has previously said.To be sure, Pledgecamp may succeed or fail, but it won’t be the last company of its kind to base its operations directly on blockchain infrastructure.ICOs and IEOs: a Novel Form of CrowdfundingAnother major development in the crowdfunding arena has been the rise of ICOs, which are transnational in scope and thus often clash with securities rules in many countries.Even still, rules or no rules, token platforms like Ethereum are permissionless so in many cases users can get ahold of ICO’d projects that launched first and asked questions later. In other instances, stricter ICOs are gatewayed through KYC processes that box out non-compliant would-be registrants.In any case, ICOs represent a new kind of crowdfunding model — legal in some places and illegal in others — that is made possible by its underlying infrastructure, blockchain tech.Of course, 2017 was a boom year for ICOs while 2018 and 2019 have seen the phenomenon dwindle, but that dwindling seems to have resulted more from ecosystem fatigue rather than a lack of technical viability. In fact, it’s trivial to spin up any asset on Ethereum; what’s more complicated is handling the more practical legal matters that are associated with traditional commerce.To that last point, one phenomenon that has arisen over the last year as part of an effort to make ICOs more palatable and trustworthy has been that of “initial exchange offerings,” or IEOs.ICOs and IEOs both entail token sales as part of a project’s crowdfunding raise, with the key difference being that IEOs are directly facilitated by cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance Launchpad’s facilitation of the Tron-backed BitTorrent (BTT) token earlier this year really kicked the trend off, and other major exchanges like Bitfinex, Bittrex, and Coinbase have followed suit in exploring the new crowdfunding practice.Read: What is an IEO?The DAO & Newer ExperimentsAnother important wrinkle to consider at the crossroads of blockchain and crowdfunding is the advent of DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations.Thus far we have mainly been talking about “crowdfunding” with regard to the relatively new industry that’s sprung up around mainstream-facing crowdfunding platforms.Yet, in zooming out and speaking of crowdfunding in a much more general sense, there is arguably no related experimentation more interesting than what the cryptoeconomy is seeing around DAOs right now.So what are they? A decentralized autonomous organization is a novel kind of organization that has its internal rules managed on-chain by blockchain smart contracts. In this sense, DAOs are similar to community councils comprised of like-minded stakeholders that 1) associate voluntarily around a common goal or goals, and 2) use smart contracts to trustlessly enforce participation rules and operations.In this sense, there’s no real limit to what you can create a DAO for — you could set one up to help manage the funds of a recurring poker match between a small group of friends, for instance. But people do debate what these hybrid physical-and-digital organizations could and should be, and while the space is still young and experimentation is still early, two main styles of DAOs have risen to the fore: for-profit venture DAOs and goal-orientated funding DAOs.The most famous, or rather infamous, decentralized autonomous organization to date was known simply as The DAO. It was set up as a crowdfunded and investor-director venture capital fund that was worth $150 million at its height. In the summer of 2016, an attacker used a vulnerability in The DAO’s code to siphon off 3.6 million ether (ETH) from the fund.As the Ethereum project was still early, the platform’s community leaders rallied around a hard fork to mitigate the hack’s economic fallout, a move that led to the Ethereum vs. Ethereum Classic schism — those who stayed behind on the “old” chain became the ETC camp.MolochDAOSomewhat understandably, the dramatic episode seemed to largely chill innovation around DAOs for over two years. Things seemed to pick back up in early 2019, when SpainkChain co-founder and chief executive officer Ameen Soleimani launched MolochDAO, a grassroots crowdfunding group set on funding open-source Ethereum development efforts on their own.MolochDAO quickly became a hit, with the group raising its first $1 million for grants and the like in a matter of months. And the project, with its code being open source and thus easily copyable, led to a flurry of new DAO upstarts popping up throughout the rest of 2019.One of these newcomers is MetaCartel DAO, which is focused on supporting and funding projects on the “Ethereum application layer,” so dApps. The group is prepping a new spinoff organization, MetaCartel Ventures DAO, that is essentially a hybrid between the for-profit and goal-orientated DAO styles.With all that said, the DAO ecosystem is still early, but among other things it opens up new kinds of crowdfunding and fund management possibilities. Whether these organizations end up gaining wider traction in society remains to be seen, but in the very least a safe bet is that many more DAO experiments are coming, and many will have crowdfunding elements.Laws Still Developing Around Blockchain and CrowdfundingAnother factor to consider at the intersection of blockchain and crowdfunding is that since both sectors are still nascent, jurisdictions around the world are still actively grappling with how best to legislate these arenas. .This dynamic makes it so that enterprises in both spaces flock to regions that have proven to be friendly hubs for their ecosystems, like Silicon Valley and the U.K. for crowdfunding platforms and Germany and Singapore for blockchain projects.Accordingly, if other countries remain slower than the aforementioned places in modernizing their laws in these fields, then look for these innovation hubs to become that much more popular among alternative finance startups going forward.Big Questions Ahead of Further AdoptionLet’s say hypothetically that the mainstream crowdfunding sector does continue to increasingly embrace blockchain tech. In speculating on that possibility, a number of interesting questions come to mind.For one, what platform should be used? A few years ago, some theorized that smart contract platform fragmentation — where different smart contract platforms become popular in different places and sectors for different reasons — would eventually reign.To date, though, we’ve seen the opposite happen: around the world the vast majority of recent activity and development in the smart contracts field have centered around Ethereum, the reigning smart contract platform. Resources and community knowledge has abounded in kind.As things currently stand then, Ethereum is easily the leading public blockchain for companies looking to build using smart contract tech. Of course, Ethereum was already the home of ICOs, but its tech can be just as readily used by crowdfunding companies in the future.Considering that reality though, crowdfunding firms that were planning to use Ethereum would have to seriously consider some big picture questions, like how to approach on-chain assets if Ethereum experiences another contentious hard fork. Some analysts have argued Ethereum has become “unforkable” because of large DeFi projects, which offers an example of how crowdfunding startups would have big questions to ask but also informative community resources to lean on all along the way.Moreover, if the meld of crowdfunding with blockchain is to make further inroads to the mainstream, then standing questions around user experience (UX) and asset custody will need to continue to be addressed.There is already movement on these fronts, though. For example, starting in 2020 German banks are set to be allowed to directly custody their clients’ digital assets, which paves the way for banks custodying digital crowdfunded investments, like security tokens representing real estate or equity. This is just one avenue of potential improvement that could make wider adoption of these assets considerably more likely.Altogether, the intersection of blockchain and crowdfunding is an intersection to keep a close eye on in the years ahead, as it will most certainly produce more noteworthy innovations and melds that could have tangible impacts on billions of lives.Open questions may abound, but it’s clear that neither blockchain or crowdfunding are going away any time soon. In fact, the opposite seems true: these two arenas seem poised to swell in the decades to come.    3,911"
21,Blockonomi,Udemy Review: Online Learning Platform for Students & Teachers,Kane Pepi,1592909151.0,"There can be no denying that the future of education and self-development is likely to be dominated by the online sector. In fact, even universities are now offering core degree courses via distance learning. As such, it comes as no surprise to discover that online academies like Udemy are now home to tens of millions of students.For those unaware, Udemy is an online course platform that matches learners and educators. Whether you’re looking to build and sell a course or take a course as a student, the platform is well worth considering.In our in-depth Udemy review, we cover everything you need to know about the online academy. This includes key metrics from the perspective of both course providers and students, subsequently allowing you to make an informed decision prior to signing up.Visit UdemyWhat is Udemy?Contents1 What is Udemy?2 Udemy Courses – Are you a Course Creator or Student?2.1 Udemy Students – The Basics2.2 Choosing a Course2.3 Exploring a Course Before Payment2.4 How Much do Udemy Courses Cost2.5 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee2.6 Post-Course Credit and Recognition3 Udemy Course Creators – The Basics3.1 Building Your Course3.2 How Much can you Make?3.3 Getting Your Pricing Right3.4 Building up Your Feedback3.5 The Volume Game3.6 How Much Does Udemy Take?3.7 Is the revenue model fair?4 Udemy Public Reviews and Ratings5 Best Blockchain Courses at Udemy5.1 Blockchain and Bitcoin Fundamentals by George Levy5.2 The Complete Cryptocurrency Investment Course by Mohsen Hassan5.3 Blockchain A-Z: Learn How To Build Your First Blockchain by Hadelin de Ponteves and Kirill Eremenko5.4 Blockchain for Business 2020: The New Industrial Revolution by 365 Careers6 Udemy Review: The Verdict7 Udemy7.1 Ease of Use7.2 Reputation7.3 Fees7.4 Customer Support7.5 Design8 Pros 9 Cons Launched in 2009, Udemy is an online platform that matches course providers with students. More specifically, courses at the platform can be created by anyone. As such, whether you’re a seasoned accountant, WordPress developer, or a mathematician – you can market your skills to a global audience.To highlight just how popular Udemy has become since its inception a mere 11 years ago, the platform has since attracted over 50 million students. This translates into over 150,000 courses, and more than 295 million course enrollments. In terms of those behind the courses, Udemy claims that it has hosted more than 57,000 instructors. Udemy HomepageIt is important to note that Udemy is not reserved just for those speaking English as a first language. On the contrary, the platform now hosts courses in more than 65 different languages. All in all, these figures demonstrate that Udemy is the go-to platform for online learning.Udemy Courses – Are you a Course Creator or Student?As this review is aimed at both course creators and students, it’s best that we initially split the two perspectives so you can ascertain whether or not the platform is right for you.Udemy Students – The BasicsAt one end of the Udemy spectrum, you might be here reading this review because you are looking to develop some new skills. Crucially, Udemy is as good as it gets in the online space for learning subjects you are interested in, as the platform hosts over 150,000+ courses.While listing each and every topic is beyond the remit of this review, rest assured that in all likelihood, you’ll find a course creator that offers what you are looking for.To get the ball rolling, you simply need to search for the course you are interested in taking. For example, let’s say that you want to learn about blockchain technology. By searching for ‘blockchain’, you will be presented with well over 1,000 individual courses. Blockchain CoursesThis includes everything from an entry-level course on the basics of blockchain technology, how to trade cryptocurrencies, and a fully-fledged program on learning Solidity. Once you find a course that you are interested in taking, you simply need to add it to your basket and make a payment.Then, you can take as long as you wish to go through each module, as Udemy courses remain active for a lifetime.Choosing a CourseWith so many individual courses at Udemy – many of which aim to teach the same thing, you might be wondering how the platform separates the wheat from the chaff?After all, with more than 150,000 individual courses hosted at the site, Udemy does not have the resources to pre-vet each and every offering. The good news is that Udemy is not required to rate courses itself, as this role is reserved for past and existing students.In fact, the rating system operates much in the same way as an eBay seller, insofar that those buying goods and services have the chance to give feedback on the item. As such, unless a course has just been launched at the platform, you should have a good amount of feedback to draw from.For example, let’s stick with our search for ‘blockchain’, which we then narrowed down to ‘Solidity’. In doing so, we are presented with 29 different courses. As such, the logical thing to do is sort the results by the course’s rating.This leads us to a course named ‘Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer’s Guide’ by Stephen Gride. In total, the course ranks an impressive 4.5/5 across just under 10,000 individual reviews. What we can also see is that the course lasts for 24 hours in total, across 250 lectures. Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer’s GuideExploring a Course Before PaymentOnce you have clicked on a course that you like the look of, you then get the chance to explore what the program consists of. At the forefront of this is a breakdown of [A] what you will learn and [B] what modules you will need to go through to complete the course.What we really like is that you get to preview some of the individual modules in video format. In doing so, this gives you a full birds-eye view of whether or not the course is right for you. Ultimately, we all learn in different ways, so it’s always nice to see and hear how the content creators strive to get their information across.How Much do Udemy Courses CostOn the one hand, courses at Udemy can range from $0, right up to $100 or more. However, in the vast majority of cases, we find that courses sit within the $10-$30 range.Regardless of what course you are taking, it is somewhat uncanny just how many programs are discounted by 85% or more. We would assume that Udemy does this to show that the courses are worth much more than they are selling for. With that said, value derives from the ratings and feedback that past or current students leave.Nevertheless, it must be noted that at an average range of $10-$30, a lot of courses at Udemy offer tremendous value. As per the Solidity course that we briefly discussed earlier, you are paying $15 for more than 250 lectures, across 24 hours of high-level content.30-Day Money-Back GuaranteeAn additional protection that you have when buying a course at Udemy is the platform’s 30-day money-back guarantee. Irrespective of the reason, Udemy will give you a full refund if you feel that the course did not meet your expectations. This remains constant across each and every course at the site.Post-Course Credit and RecognitionOn the one hand, it is entirely feasible to learn a skill or subject area significantly faster than you would at a traditional academic institution.For example, while a traditional Bachelor’s degree in accounting would take you 3 or 4 years, it’s possible to learn the same amount of information in at least half the time. This is because you can condense as much material as you can handle. In other words, while University students typically get 3-4 months worth of leave per academic year, you could be utilizing this time by studying additional courses at Udemy.On the other hand, it is important to note that your Udemy courses will not be recognized in the same light as a university-based degree. While this might not necessarily hinder your chances of monetizing your new found skill, it’s important to bear in mind.So now that we have covered the basics of what Udemy offers to those looking to learn a new skill, in the next section of our review we are going to focus on content creators.Udemy Course Creators – The BasicsIn a nutshell, if you have a skill that you think other people would pay to learn – then Udemy is right for you. For example, let’s say that you have been building WordPress websites for a number of years. While you don’t have any qualifications per-say, you feel that you know the platform like the back of your hand. As such, Udemy gives you the opportunity to build a course and sell it on their website.In the vast majority of cases, Udemy courses consist of videos that are accompanied by extracurricular activities. For example, the course might ask you to complete a task before moving on to the next module. Each module typically lasts between 5-15 minutes – depending on the complexity of the topic. Earn money every time a student purchases your courseMost modules will ask you to take a quiz of some sort to ensure you understand the material. As we discuss in more detail later, one of the main advantages of building a course through Udemy is that the design process is tailored to beginners.This means that you are not required to have any skills or knowledge in building courses, as Udemy guides you through the entire process in a simple step-by-step manner. As such, you get to focus on the skill you are actually looking to market.Building Your CourseAs noted in the section above, Udemy wants its course creators to focus on what they know best – the skill they are looking to teach. As a result, the platform makes it a seamless process when building your course from scratch.Your first port of call should be to load up the step-by-step video series that Udemy offers. This breaks down the entire end-to-end process of what it takes to build a course.Somewhat ironically, you will also find courses at Udemy on how to build a course on Udemy. The platform itself offers its own version for free, while other content creators have launched their own paid-for alternatives. Either way, you have all of the information you need at Udemy to get started with a course straightaway.What we also like is that Udemy gives you assistance on the technicals. This includes everything from getting your camera and lighting right, to downloading and installing screencasting software.Udemy also gives you the option of getting your course reviewed by one of its team. This won’t cost you anything, and it ensures that any potential short-fallings are picked up on before hitting the market. Teacher’s Profile on UdemyHow Much can you Make?So that brings us to the golden question – how much can you make selling courses at Udemy? Unfortunately, there is no one size fits all answer to this question, as there are a number of variables to take into account.Getting Your Pricing RightFirst and foremost, Udemy does give you the freedom to set your own prices. The platform recommends a rate of between $10-$30 for each hour of course content.For example, if your course is 10 hours long, you are advised to charge between $100 and $300. Unfortunately, it’s unlikely that you will get anywhere near this amount – especially if there are heaps of other established courses teaching the same thing.As such, you do need to be very precise with what you decide to charge. For example, let’s say that you have created a course on how to build your own blockchain. Your first task should be to see what similar top-ranking courses are selling at. After all, if there are courses with thousands of 5-star ratings selling at $15, you likely won’t land a single student if you pitch in at $60.On the contrary, you’ll be launching a branch new course with no feedback or ratings, so to be in with a chance of standing out from the crowd, you might be best to offer your course at a lower rate.Building up Your FeedbackMuch like you would as an e-book seller on Amazon, offering your Udemy course at a cost-effective price is likely to attract students. Once they have had the opportunity to enjoy your course, it is then hoped that they will leave you positive feedback, alongside a 5-star rating.As you get more and more satisfied students, you should begin to notice your course go up the rankings. For example, while you might have initially started on page 10 of the search results on your blockchain course, you might now be sitting on page 2.As such, this will allow you to increase the price of your course – and subsequently put it more in-line with your main competitors. Crucially, if you are confident that your course offers excellent value to those buying it, the rest should take care of itself. Student feedbackThe Volume GameWe often come across online courses in the public domain selling for hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. However, most sellers at Udemy sit within the all-important $10-$30 range. With that said, if your online course starts to fly off the shelf, you can make some serious cash.To illustrate just how successful some course creators are at Udemy, let’s go back to our previous example – Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer’s Guide.As noted earlier, the course costs $15, and it has just under 10,000 positive reviews. However, upon closer inspection, the course has actually been purchased by just over 43,000 students. Doing the math – that amounts to total sales of $645,000.It is also important to note that the course creator – Stephen Grider, has 26 Udemy courses listed at the site. In total, Grider has enrolled more than 556,000 students. This works out at millions of dollars in revenue, which is huge.However, there is a major consideration that you need to make before you start counting your future revenues – Udemy commissions.How Much Does Udemy Take?Udemy is an online platform that is in the business of making money. As such, you as a content creator will need to engage in a profit-share agreement with the platform. In Layman’s terms, this means that for every course you sell at the platform, Udemy will take a commission.This is no different to YouTube taking a cut of your advertising revenue, even though it was you that did all of the hard work. As such, this is just the name of the game.Nevertheless, the profit-sharing model at Udemy is somewhat confusing at first glance, as it depends on how the student found the course.Organic: If the student finds your course naturally – such as finding it through the search function, then there is a 50/50 split with Udemy. However, if the sale is made via the iOS or Android app, Apple and Google both charge a 30% fee on gross revenuesInstructor Promotion: If you were able to bring a new student to the Udemy platform yourself, and they proceed to purchase your course, then you get to keep 97% of the revenue. However, the student will need to enter a specific coupon or referral link to qualify. This is a win-win situation, as although Udemy gets less revenue, they have effectively acquired a new customer that might end up purchasing other courses.Paid User Acquisition Channel Sales: Udemy partners with a number of third-party affiliates in the online space that will promote the platform. If the new customer ends up purchasing your course through one of these affiliates, then you will only get to keep 25% of the revenue.As you can see from the above, there is quite the disparity in how much of your revenues you get to keep. Sitting anywhere between 25% and 97%, it really depends on how your students come across your course.Is the revenue model fair?Potentially, especially when you consider that you do not need to pay any fees to create or launch the course, so the only risk you are taking is your time. Crucially, when you do launch a course, you gain access to a platform that is home to more than 50 million members.Udemy Public Reviews and RatingsTaking into the account the numbers that Udemy publishes on its website, it’s clear to see that the platform is hugely popular with both content creators and students alike. With that said, it’s always a good exercise to see what reviews and ratings are like in the public domain.Over at TrustPilot, it is somewhat surprising that the platform has a 3/5 ‘Average’ rating. This is only across 495 individual reviews though, which is very low when you consider the 50 million+ members that Udemy claims to have. Trustpilot RatingThings are also a bit non-descript over at the Consumers Affairs website, with Udemy currently on a 2/5 rating. However, this is based across just 92 individual reviews, so this does need to be taken with a pinch of salt.The good news is that the Udemy reviews are a lot more valid at Google Play, with more than 212,000 individual ratings. This yields a very impressive score of 4.4/5. Things also look good for Udemy on the Apple Store, with a 4.6/5 rating across 17,000 individual reviews.Best Blockchain Courses at UdemySo now that you know the ins and outs of how Udemy works, we are now going to discuss our some of the top blockchain courses that are currently available at the platform.Blockchain and Bitcoin Fundamentals by George LevyIf you’re looking to learn the key elements of blockchain technology, a great starting point would be to consider the Blockchain and Bitcoin Fundamentals course by George Levy.

Many leading game developers are looked after through this offering.For slots players, there are more than 1,800 different options. You can quickly see what games are offered from different developers.Some of the biggest names in the business are catered for, such as Play’n GO, Microgaming, Yggdrasil, Pragmatic, Evolution Gaming, Onetouch, Betsoft and Quickfire. There are different types of slots, from ultra-modern 3D games to video slots and more classic types of games.Some of the most popular titles on the platform include the likes of Mr. Vegas, Gladiator and Aztec Treasures. If you do not want to put your hard-earned money on the line straight away, you are able to play all of these games for free. Some of the 95 slots games on offerAt the time of writing, there were more than 30 different progressive slots to play. The jackpots for these titles varied widely, with some of the options such as Megah Moolah offering significant sums to be won.The table games offering is a bit smaller than a lot of competitors, with fifty options in total. This is still satisfactory for the majority of online casino players, with all of the major bases being well-covered.Blackjack is the most popular table game on the site, with numerous variants including High Roller and Perfect Pairs variants. Roulette is similarly very well-supported, with Baccarat also having a big emphasis, which you would not often see with a lot of online casinos. Then you have a selection of casino poker games and some niche options such as Dragon Tiger and Sic Bo.BitCasino Live Casino OfferingThere is also a comprehensive live casino offering on the BitCasino platform. Live dealer games have grown massively in popularity in recent years, with this type of offering only set to grow as the world moves into a 5G space.In total, there are more than one hundred different live dealer games you have access to.

Oftentimes, a platform will have welcome bonus packages as a way to entice people to sign up for an account.These are often in the form of free spins, deposit bonuses or no deposit bonus funds. In the past, there have been welcome promotions running at the BitCasino.The previous welcome bonus offer allowed you to have your first deposit matched 100%, up to a max bonus of 1 BTC. There were x35 wagering requirements for this offer, which is about average for the industry. There were also certain types of games that would contribute 100% to the wagering requirements, with some types of games not contributing at all.Regular Promotions and Loyalty ProgramThere are regular promotions for existing customers of the BitCasino platform to avail of. These change on a regular basis, usually having interesting twists that are not seen with a lot of other operators. You can even see the past promotions that BitCasino has been running if you wish to do so on the site’s ‘Promotions’ page.The current promotions vary. There is an offer that boosts winnings on certain slots titles that are exclusive to the BitCasino platform. There is also a large prize pool that players can battle it out for by playing certain slots titles, with those at the head of the leaderboard getting some great prizes. There are also daily free spins and cash prizes when you play certain games. The Loyalty ClubNaturally, most of these promotions and bonus funds bring along wagering requirements with them.

In total, there are seven tiers to the program and the bonuses will be tailored depending on your preferred types of games.Overall, the promotions are decent, with a nice variety and the loyalty program is an ideal way of eking out extra perks from using the BitCasino platform.Payment MethodsThere are a few different types of payment methods that are now available to users on the BitCasino site. This is not just a crypto casino any longer, there are also options to deposit using fiat currencies. However, at its core, it is still a crypto casino and thus it is well-catered for in this regard.The cryptocurrencies that you can add funds to your account include Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. The main fiat currencies that are supported on the platform are Japanese Yen and Euros. Crypto deposits are easy to makeFor the fiat deposit options, you can use a credit card, SticPay, Neteller, MuchBetter, debit card or EcoPayz. The process of adding funds using crypto is very easy and carries fewer transaction costs and is usually quicker than the fiat options.For crypto withdrawals, they only take a matter of minutes, whereas some of the fiat options will take a few business days for your withdrawn funds to hit your respective account.You can add crypto funds either by using a QR Code or by simply copying and pasting your wallet address when making the transaction. You will get a confirmation once this process has completed. You can also deposit using Bitcoin through a given debit card that supports this type of payment.SecurityAs BitCasino is mainly a crypto casino, you know that the name of the fame will be anonymity and security.

This security supplier regularly checks for vulnerabilities and gives incentives for people to report any potential bugs.The information you have to enter is limited to selecting a username, entering an email address and setting a password. Then you will be able to get started depositing via crypto without having to go through any of the standard verification checks that are associated with using fiat currency to add funds to an online gambling account.For the protection of the site itself, there is SSL encryption used across the board on the site to ensure that all sensitive data is kept well protected. You can also use the likes of two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security onto your account. The casino software is very modern, with regular security checks being conducted to ensure that there are no flaws in the system.To ensure the fairness of the games, there is also regular testing completed to ensure that there is no rigging of games.

23,Blockonomi,Bybit Enables Fiat Crypto Purchases Via Debit & Credit Cards,Osato Avan-Nomayo,1592834019.0,"Crypto derivatives exchange Bybit is looking to simplify the cryptocurrency purchasing process by including fiat onramps on its platform. Now, users will be able to buy digital tokens using their debit and credit cards.Fiat payment gateways can provide easier access into the crypto space given that people are already used to making online purchases via processors like Mastercard and Visa. However, exchanges need to partner with reliable payment providers to enable such functionalities on their platform.Seamless Funding and Trading for Bybit UsersContents1 Seamless Funding and Trading for Bybit Users2 An End to No KYC?3 Crypto Derivatives Trading ‘Arms Race’Bybit announced the news of its fiat onramp via a press release shared with Blockonomi on Monday (June 22, 2020). According to the press statement, the crypto derivatives exchange has inked useful partnerships with payment providers Banxa and Xanpool to allow its customers to buy cryptocurrencies using Mastercard, and Visa credit/debit cards. Bybit users can also buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) via bank transfer.For Bybit, the roll-out of credit and debit card crypto purchasing is to provide its users with greater funding flexibility. According to Bybit, instant cryptocurrency buying via fiat onramps mean users can quickly fund their accounts and enter into potentially profitable trading positions.Commenting on the new feature, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou told Blockonomi:“Adding fiat-crypto support is another major milestone in our roadmap, and a major coup for Bybit traders who have been patiently waiting for this day to arrive. Thanks to our payment partners Banxa and Xanpool, Bybit users can now frictionlessly purchase crypto with credit or debit card at some of the most competitive rates on the market.”As part of the roll-out of its fiat payment onramp, Bybit is launching a promotion that will see customers earn bonuses of $10 in BTC for each $100 BTC or ETH bought via credit or debit card. According to the Singapore-based derivatives exchange, users stand a chance of winning up to $50 in BTC during the one-month-long campaign.An End to No KYC?Crypto transactions involving fiat often come under regulatory scrutiny with authorities worried about money laundering and other illegal financial dealings. Hence, crypto platforms that deal with national currencies in regulated environments tend to adhere to know your customer (KYC) verification standards.Critics of KYC checks say the storage of customer’s personal information is an invitation to hackers and other cybercriminals. Indeed, apart from the theft of funds, cryptocurrency businesses have seen malicious intrusions aimed at stealing user data.As previously reported by Blockonomi, Bybit does not require KYC checks for operating trading accounts on its platform. The platform rolled out is crypto derivatives trading service at the start of 2019 and has since added Tether (USDT) perpetual contracts. As part of the USDT perpetual contracts roll out, the exchange carried out a 1,000 USDT airdrop back in April.Crypto Derivatives Trading ‘Arms Race’Trading crypto derivatives is becoming more popular with several platforms jostling for a greater share of the expanding market. Even emerging market sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) are beginning to appear appealing to stakeholders in the cryptocurrency derivatives scene. With DeFi lending protocol Compound making a big splash over the last few days, some platforms are announcing plans to launch derivatives based on the second-largest DeFi project.Crypto derivatives trading topped $2T in Q1 2020, almost a quarter of the $8.8T cryptocurrency trading total recorded during the period as captured by TokenInsight. Large liquidations on crypto derivatives platforms are accompanying massive price surges or dumps for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general, an indication of the growing influence exerted by the market sector.    1,402"
24,Blockonomi,Ethereum Going Mainstream: These Are the Scaling Tools That Will Get It There,William M. Peaster,1592823376.0,"According to more than a few cryptoeconomy analysts, Ethereum is on the precipice of making considerable inroads to the mainstream via multiple different avenues. Can the platform carry on to the promised land, then?That remains to be seen, but optimism is growing that the reigning smart contracts platform can reach unprecedented adoption heights. To turn vision into reality, the Ethereum ecosystem will have to handle acutely high gas prices first.Gas is the amount of ETH a user pays to get their transaction included in an Ethereum block. During periods of high demand for Ethereum block space, transaction congestion ensues and gas prices spike.In recent weeks, gas prices have been high as Ethereum’s DeFi and NFT sectors continue to swell. On the one hand, that’s great news: it shows Ethereum is useful in the here and now and people are clamoring to use it. On the other hand, high gas prices are a pain point for users and could stunt widespread adoption if maintained over the long-term.Luckily for Ethereum, its ecosystem of layer-two scaling solutions is also swelling and advancing toward maturity. These tools will drastically increase transaction throughput abilities and in kind drastically lower gas prices. In other words, these innovations are some of the biggest keys to Ethereum’s adoption by the mainstream’s masses.Let’s dig deeper and survey this rising constellation of scaling solutions.The Layer-Two Scaling MatrixContents1 The Layer-Two Scaling Matrix2 Optimistic Rollups3 zkRollups4 Plasma5 Validium6 Orthogonal to ETH 2.07 Progress Mounting8 Fees Could Be High Until Wider Adoption9 ConclusionIn recent years, Ethereum layer-two scaling research has coalesced into 4 main areas. In order from oldest to newest, they are Plasma, zkRollups, Optimistic Rollups, and Validium.If you want to visually compare how all these solutions fit into the bigger picture, a great resource is Ben DiFrancesco’s 99th issue of the Build Blockchain Tech newsletter. Therein, DiFrancesco published Ethereum’s “Layer 2 Two-By-Two” matrix, which appears as follows: Image via Build Blockchain TechSo what’s this all mean?Simply put, a base-layer blockchain like Ethereum stores all its data on the mainnet and executes all its computation there. By handling data storage and/or computation differently than the mainnet does, layer-two scaling solutions can deliver extensive throughput enhancements for Ethereum.Optimistic RollupsOptimistic Rollups, or ORUs, can be understood as extremely scalable sidechains. They fit where they do in DiFrancesco’s aforementioned matrix because they store data on-chain (on the Ethereum mainnet) while handling computation off-chain.In order to ensure this off-chain computation is correct, ORUs employ fraud proofs. This means that if someone tries to submit fraudulent activity, users can contest the fraud and have a deposit owned by the bad actor slashed.Compared to zkRollups, Plasma, and Validium, ORUs don’t offer as much when it comes to throughput enhancement. However, where ORUs really shine is they’re essentially ready to be deployed in widespread fashion in the here and now. In this sense, ORUs are not only very useful but can also buy time for other scaling tools to mature.zkRollupsLike ORUs, zkRollups store data on-chain. But zkRollups differ in that their off-chain computation relies on zero-knowledge validity proofs rather than fraud proofs for accuracy.This dynamic makes zkRollups powerful but not without their limitations. For now, they have to be tailored to specific applications because a generalized zkRollup would not be efficient.On the bright side, various zkRollups solutions have made great strides in the Ethereum ecosystem in recent months. This reality suggests it won’t be long before these rollups gain more tangible traction around the Ethereum project.PlasmaPlasma is the oldest of the 4 layer-two scaling solutions under discussions, and it’s noted for handling both computation and data storage off-chain. Like ORUs, Plasma implementations rely on fraud proofs rather than zero-knowledge proofs.In 2019, it seemed that development efforts began to chill around Plasma-based systems, though that’s reversed this year as the solution’s back in the limelight on the heels of OmiseGo revealed its More Viable Plasma (MoreVP) specification earlier this month.ValidiumValidium is the newest of Ethereum’s top layer-two scaling solutions to hit the scene. It keeps data storage off-chain and deals with computation using zero-knowledge proofsThe first example of Validium in action is StarkWare’s StarkEx engine, which is designed to power decentralized exchanges with great efficiency. Accordingly, in the future many DEXes may come to rely on Validium tech.Orthogonal to ETH 2.0What’s interesting about the aforementioned scaling solutions is that they can power major throughput enhancements for Ethereum, no matter where the platform is in its lifespan.For example, developers are currently in the process of evolving “Ethereum 1.0,” i.e. the platform as we currently know it, into “Ethereum 2.0,” which will effectively be an entirely new blockchain with extensive optimizations. One of these optimizations will be the rollout of sharding.Sharding is still a few years away, but once it’s live it will make Ethereum truly ready for being public infrastructure for all the world’s people. The cool thing, though, is that solutions like ORUs, zkRollups, Plasma, and Validium will still be usable and useful once sharding is activated. Taken altogether, sharding combined with a growing stable of layer-two innovations can make Ethereum a tour de force for decades to come.Progress MountingIn recent weeks, the cryptoeconomy has seen multiple layer-two Ethereum scaling implementations making notable strides.We mentioned OmiseGo’s newly rolled out Plasma tool earlier. When it comes to zkRollups, users can already take tools like Loopring Pay and zkSync for a spin, too. And last month, the ORU specialists at Fuel Labs teased Reddit Cash, an ORU system that showed how Reddit community tokens like BRICKS and MOONS can be readily scaled using Fuel’s tech.Speaking of Reddit, the social aggregator giant made waves this week when it announced the “Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off,” a competition for Ethereum community members to propose the best layer-two scaling solution or solutions for the website’s new community tokens system.“Our goal is to find a solution that will support hundreds of thousands of Community Points users on mainnet today, and can eventually scale to all of Reddit (430 million monthly users),” Reddit said.Fees Could Be High Until Wider AdoptionAll of the layer-two scaling solutions discussed in this post are advancing closer to widespread adoption in the Ethereum community. Yet until this adoption is reached, the acutely high gas fees Ethereum users are facing right now could remain in place.That’s because demand to use Ethereum is high, and this demand doesn’t seem poised to slow down any time soon as the DeFi and NFT sectors continue to heat up. So gas prices are likely to stay a pain point until layer-two implementations arrive in force to save the day.ConclusionTransactions on Ethereum are already cheap and quick compared to many mainstream payment rails. These transactions are imminently going to become much cheaper and much quicker courtesy of innovations like ORUs and zkRollups.With that said, Ethereum could be on the precipice of becoming a gamechanger in the wider international payments arena and not just within the cryptoeconomy.An Ethereum with effective scaling avenues is an Ethereum that can start to seriously contend with the PayPals, Venmos, and Squares of the world.If Ethereum does end up making it big in the future, it will assuredly be partially on the backs of the scaling solutions that extended the platform’s capabilities in its early years.    3,471"
25,Blockonomi,What are Discreet Log Contracts? Using Bitcoin for DeFi,Brian Curran,1592560811.0,"DeFi has attracted significant attention over 2020 as hundreds of projects on Ethereum have emerged at the intersection of blockchains and open financial instruments ranging from collateralized stablecoins to derivatives products.While much more feasible at this point on a smart contracts platform like Ethereum, the notion of decentralized finance does not explicitly exclude bitcoin from the broader implications of DeFi products on the legacy cryptocurrency’s network.Although not expressly DeFi, as they are hybrid instances of blending crypto assets and conventional financial structures, companies like BlockFi already offer borrowing and lending with bitcoin.Similarly, sidechains (e.g., RSK) may eventually furnish the type of smart contract capabilities, similar to ethereum, that can enable more sophisticated financial products built on bitcoin.However, there are some other intriguing takes on extending bitcoin’s protocol to more advanced financial applications, and specifically, one interesting proposal that has gained traction over the last couple years is called discreet log contracts.Why Use Bitcoin for DeFi?Contents1 Why Use Bitcoin for DeFi?2 So, what exactly are the trade-offs with building DeFi on bitcoin?3 What Are Discrete Log Contracts?4 Potential Uses5 ConclusionApproaching DeFi applications on bitcoin is somewhat precarious. For example, significant value underscores the proposition that bitcoin’s simple, stripped-down design is an enormous advantage for its long-term sustainability and robustness.Many core bitcoin proponents view the OP_RETURN function for arbitrary data storage as unnecessary, citing the ability to deposit non-transaction information into the blockchain as opening additional attack incentives.Interestingly, OmniLayer, which uses opcode space for identifier payloads, was a core component of the stablecoin Tether’s initial iteration before expanding to ethereum using ERC-20.Conversely, concepts like bitcoin’s lightning network (LN) have presented an entirely new design space for bitcoin. Via layered scaling, applications can be created on top of bitcoin’s core protocol that do not directly detract from its security model.This is a compelling narrative as it has opened the doors for the exploration of applications that leverage hash-time locked contracts and other clever technical tools. The results are the already growing prevalence of apps (i.e., “lapps”) built using the LN.So, what exactly are the trade-offs with building DeFi on bitcoin?The big limitation is the complexity of DeFi applications. RSK may ultimately prove a valuable sidechain for bitcoin, but federated peg sidechains inherently require trust in the federation managing the chain.Eventually, improvements in the underlying tech may minimize the trust further, but for now, the type of variation in DeFi projects seen on ethereum is not possible directly on bitcoin’s protocol without some compromises on trust — like with a sidechain.On the other hand, bitcoin’s security model, such as its socially conservative approach to change and ballooning hash rate, make it an ideal medium for censorship-resistant finance.Similarly, bitcoin’s fixed monetary policy and supreme liquidity among all crypto assets make it even more of a profound case study for the long-term implications of DeFi due to the underlying confidence in its native value and predictable supply.Skipping over some of the fascinating projects working on ideas like decentralized swaps and other financial instruments with bitcoin, let’s focus on extrapolating the underlying mechanics of the LN to DeFi — specifically with discreet log contracts.What Are Discrete Log Contracts?Initially proposed by Thaddeus Dryja of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, and incidentally, co-author of the original LN paper, discreet log contracts are a method for minimizing the trust in acquiring data from external sources to the blockchain — popularly referred to as oracles.At a high level, discreet log contracts do not enable Turing-complete smart contracts on bitcoin. Rather, they hinge on using Schnorr signatures to mask the agreed upon contract details from the oracle, effectively creating a situation where payouts on publicly known data (i.e., a number) are possible between three parties in the process.The immediate advantages are better privacy and more flexible smart contracts without the trust compromises at the scale of a sidechain.For example, and within the context of DeFi, Alice and Bob can open a futures contract between each other speculating on the future price of bitcoin on a specific date. Using the power of multi-sig outputs, the details of their contract can be masked from the blockchain, with the contract containing the committed funds of both Alice and Bob.Subsequently, a third-party oracle publishes signed messages that are incorporated into the contract details as the pivotal data that determines how the funds in the contract should be allocated.In the case of Alice and Bob’s futures contract, funds committed to the contract would be delivered based on the supplied price of bitcoin at the expiration of the futures contract.Importantly, the oracle is blind throughout this entire process to both the fact that Alice and Bob are using its price data and about the actual details of the contract.This prevents the oracle from front-running or manipulating the contract with bad price data. Additionally, the setup precludes the oracle from becoming a decisive party in the agreement between Alice and Bob (i.e., 2-of-3 multisg), and instead, enables Alice or Bob to withdraw funds based on the (blind) signed message that is publicly published by the oracle.The downstream consequences of such a model are that the inherent trust assumptions of oracles connecting blockchains to the outside world, known as the oracle problem, can be reduced to a point where more advanced smart contracts can be run on bitcoin without making prohibitive trust trade-offs.Potential UsesApplied to DeFi, the ability of two parties to leverage discreet log contracts unleashes the potential of futures, derivatives, and other financial instruments.More sophisticated financial products tied directly to bitcoin can create future instances where standard institutional and speculative practices, like hedging risk on commodities and other assets, become viable via bitcoin’s network.Micro-insurance contracts are even possible using discreet log contracts by relying on oracle-sourced data for payouts of specific claims.Notably, discreet log contracts rely on similar technology to the LN. According to the discreet log contracts paper:“Similar to the currently developing Lightning Network software [4], parties agree on the contract state but hold variations of the same transaction…While in the Lightning Network these scripts are used to maintain consistency in a payment channel such that either party broadcasting an old state allows the other party to take all the funds from both outputs, in DLC the same output script is used for a different purpose. Alice and Bob do not reveal secrets to each other; rather it is Olivia who reveals a secret to everyone.”As a note, Olivia is the oracle in the above quote.The salient takeaway from the discreet log design is that users can privately set up financial contracts, and only have to trust the oracle to sign the correct data, such as the price, rather than perform the role of intermediary. Dryja goes on to conclude in the paper:“As the transactions look the same as Lightning Network transactions, it will remain difficult to estimate the total usage of DLCs across the network, and they should allow extensive complex smart contracts to occur without unduly taxing the global network.”ConclusionThe notion of DeFi for bitcoin is often overshadowed by the prevalence of the open financial products already available on ethereum.However, bitcoin does present a compelling medium for decentralized finance for reasons drawing from its robust consensus rules and security model.Discreet log contracts are an intriguing tool that can help facilitate a more advanced DeFi ecosystem with bitcoin.    4,881"
26,Blockonomi,Crypto.com Exchange Unveils High-Performance Platform Upgrades,Osato Avan-Nomayo,1592499224.0,"Crypto.com is expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency trading scene with plans to offer margin and derivatives trading later in the year. With such lofty goals in mind, the platform has announced a slew of protocol upgrades aimed at improving its performance.Competition within the crypto derivatives scene continues to intensify as more participants enter the market with features aimed at incentivizing more users in the quest to gain a higher market share.The expansion in the cryptocurrency derivatives arena is also helping to broaden the scope of digital asset adoption with more investment instruments available to traders.Crypto.com Promises Enhanced Performance After UpgradesIn a press release shared with Blockonomi, on Thursday (June 18, 2020), Crypto.com announced the completion of several platform upgrades aimed at improving the performance of the cryptocurrency exchange. According to the press statement, the revamped Crypto.com platform comes with improvements in its Order Management System (OMS), Matching Engine, and a unified REST and WebSocket API.The latter two improvements will allow users to engage in high-frequency trading without any website downtime. The revamped Crypto.com platform also offers greater scalability and security for its customers by eliminating entry points for failure.Crypto.com says these protocol upgrades will also enable the platform to deliver 10x better performance and operational throughput. Commenting on the improvements made so far, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek, remarked:“We launched the Crypto.com Exchange last Fall with a goal of creating a trading platform so secure, liquid and user-friendly that it becomes a natural choice for both institutional and retail customers. We have already seen tremendous traction in the first six months of Beta and will continue rapidly improving our offering to drive continued growth.”Margin and Derivatives Trading on the AgendaFor Crypto.com, the improvements made to the platform are part of the move towards debuting in the cryptocurrency margin and derivatives trading arena. In recent months, cryptocurrency derivatives appear to have grown from a corner of the market to occupy a more significant place in the evolving digital currency trading scene.According to TokenInsight, crypto derivatives trading for the Q1 2020 topped $2 trillion. This figure represents a 314% increase from the average quarterly figures recorded in 2019. The $2T crypto derivatives trading volume for Q1 2020 accounted for almost a quarter of the $8.8 trillion cryptocurrency trading total for the period.Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency for margin and derivatives trading. The largest crypto by market capitalization accounted for 78% of the total turnover from the cryptocurrency derivatives market sector in Q1 2020.Crypto.com’s venture into the market will put it in direct competition with established names like Deribit, BitMEX, and Binance. New entrants into the arena often try to attract more customers via a suite of trading incentives and other features.For Crypto.com, the focus appears to be on building a service that offers robust security for users. The platform reportedly has an asset insurance coverage of $360M with its “Defense in Depth” approach aimed at ensuring complete privacy and protection for user funds.Financial regulators are increasingly looking at cryptocurrency derivatives trading amid the increasing popularity of the market sector. While still largely unregulated, agencies in countries like Japan and the U.K. have made significant moves in policing the sector.Japan has capped cryptocurrency margin trading at 2x the trader capital. In the U.K., the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is reportedly looking to ban the sale of crypto derivatives to retail investors.    3,723"
27,Blockonomi,"KuCoin Review: Cryptocurrency Exchange With Margin, Futures & Earning Options",Kane Pepi,1592385056.0,"Whether you are looking to buy digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with a debit/credit card or trade crypto-to-crypto pairs – KuCoin covers both bases.The global exchange and third-party broker is home to some of the largest trading volumes in the space, alongside a fee-structure that should suit most budgets.In this guide, we review the ins and outs of KuCoin. This includes an in-depth look at the platform’s supported coins, fiat currency facilities, fees and commissions, safety, customer support, and trading arena.Visit KucoinWhat is KuCoin?Contents1 What is KuCoin?2 What can you Trade at KuCoin?2.1 Crypto-to-Crypto Pairs2.2 KuCoin Indexes2.3 KuCoin Futures3 Trading Fees and Commissions3.1 KuCoin Shares (KCS)3.2 Discounted Trading Fees3.3 Dividends4 Price History and Buying KuCoin Shares5 Fiat Currency Facilities at KuCoin6 Trading Platforms6.1 Mobile Trading7 How Long do Withdrawals Take at KuCoin?8 Earn Interest at KuCoin9 Is KuCoin Safe?9.1 Regulation9.2 KYC10 KuCoin Security Practices10.1 2FA11 KuCoin Customer Support12 How to get Started at KuCoin12.1 Step 1: Open an Account12.2 Step 2: Deposit Funds12.2.1 Fiat Currency Deposit12.3 Step 3: Start Trading13 KuCoin Review: The Verdict?14 Kucoin14.1 Ease of Use14.2 Reputation14.3 Fees14.4 Customer Support14.5 Payment Methods15 Pros 16 Cons Launched as recently as 2017, KuCoin is a cryptocurrency exchange that also offers third-party brokerage services. Although the platform has just three years of trading history, it is now one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the space.One of the main reasons for this is that you will find over 200 coins with about 450 cryptocurrency pairs hosted at the exchange. Not only does this include major pairs like BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT, but heaps of crypto-cross pairs. Best of all, if you have an appetite to trade a less liquid ERC-20 token, chances are you will find it at KuCoin. Kucoin HomepageKuCoin was initially a cryptocurrency-only platform, meaning that you could not deposit funds with fiat currency. However, the platform has since formed a partnership with Simplex – a European payment provider that bridges the gap between cryptocurrencies and everyday money.When it comes to cryptocurrency trading fees, KuCoin charges just 0.10%. This puts it on par with the likes of Binance. Similarly, KuCoin is also behind its own digital token – KuCoin Shares (KCS). By owning and storing KCS tokens, you will benefit from discounted trading fees, as well as an entitlement to a share of the trading commissions that KuCoin collects.In terms of the numbers, KuCoin claims to have facilitated more than 650 million individual trades since its inception in 2017. This translates to more than $71 billion in accumulated trading volumes.Finally – and as we cover in more detail further down, KuCoin is not regulated by a national licensing body. Although this means that you will be able to trade cryptocurrencies without supplying any ID, this won’t be the case if you wish to buy digital coins with a debit/credit card through Simplex.What can you Trade at KuCoin?KuCoin offers a vast range of financial instruments that goes above and beyond just crypto-to-crypto pairs. On the contrary, the platform also offers cryptocurrency indexes, margin trading, and even futures.Let’s explore each asset class in more detail.Crypto-to-Crypto PairsEach and every trading pair at KuCoin falls within the remit of crypto-to-crypto, not least because it does not offer any fiat-denominated instruments. Instead, you will need to trade your chosen cryptocurrency against the USDT if you want access to the crypto-to-USD space.If you’re a seasoned cryptocurrency trader then you will know first hand that this is industry standard anyway, so you’ll have no issues with trading volumes or liquidity.Outside of USDT, you can trade crypto-cross pairs. Examples of this include BTC/ETH, ETH/XRP, and BSC/BTC. Ultimately, listing each and every trading digital currency is beyond the remit of this review, albeit, rest assured that the platform hosts more than 450 pairs. Some of the Kucoin marketsCrucially, KuCoin is often one of the very first exchanges that newly launched cryptocurrency token projects opt for. As such, support for less liquid digital tokens is something that the team at KuCoin actively look to facilitate.For a full breakdown of each and every pair that KuCoin hosts, you can find this information here at CoinMarketCap.KuCoin IndexesOn top of traditional crypto-cross pairs, KuCoin also offers a number of indexes. The concept here is that KuCoin will take the weighted average of a specific cryptocurrency across several leading exchanges.This is with the view of offering a more accurate price of the coin in question, as it takes into account the variations that you often find between competing platforms.KuCoin indexes are available across:BitcoinEthereumRippleLitecoinThe cryptocurrency exchanges that KuCoin derives its pricing activity from are:CoinbaseBitstampKrakenGeminiBittrexLiquidThe price of each index is denominated in USD, but settled in the respective cryptocurrency.KuCoin FuturesLaunched in mid-2019, the KuCoin Mercantile Exchange allows you to trade Bitcoin futures. KuCoin itself notes that it is looking to challenge the likes of BitMEX in this particular area of the cryptocurrency derivative space. As a result, you will have access to Bitcoin futures alongside a substantial margin position of up to 100x.In simple terms, this means that a $100 account balance would permit a maximum trade value of $10,000. When it comes to the underlying spot price, KuCoin once again takes the weighted average from various leading exchanges – such as Kraken, Coinbase Pro, and Bitstamp. Kucoin FuturesAt the time of writing, KuCoin only supports BTC and ETH futures, although it hopes to add further digital currencies in the near future. When it comes to fees, expect to pay 0.060% as a market taker, and 0.020% as a maker. There are also settlement fees of 0.025%.Trading Fees and CommissionsFirst and foremost, there are no fees associated with cryptocurrency deposits, and withdrawals are charged at the standard mining rate as per the coin you are looking to cash out.When it comes to trading fees outside of the futures arena, you will pay 0.1%. This means that a $10,000 trade would cost you $10 in fees. As we briefly mentioned earlier, this sits in-line with fellow exchange counterpart Binance.KuCoin Shares (KCS)KuCoin Shares – or simply KCS, is a proprietary cryptocurrency token created by the exchange. By owning and holding KCS tokens you will be accustomed to a number of benefits.This includes:Discounted Trading FeesOne of the most notable benefits of holding KuCoin Shares is that you will get discounted trading fees. Crucially, while a standard fee of 0.1% is industry-leading, you stand the potential to reduce this by an additional 20%. What you need to do is to simply turn on the KCS Pay Fee button and enjoy the discount.DividendsOn top of reducing your trading commissions, holding an allocation of KuCoin Shares affords you the opportunity to earn dividends. In a nutshell, KuCoin as a platform will distribute 50% of the trading commissions that it collects from members each and every day.This is then distributed proportionately across all holders of KuCoin Shares. For example, let’s suppose that you hold 1% of the entire KCS supply. If the platform pays out $250,000 in commissions, you would receive $2,500. You need to hold at least 6 KCS to benefit from the dividends.Price History and Buying KuCoin SharesTo say the value of KuCoin Shares has capitulated since its all-time highs of January 2018 would be an understatement. At a peak of over $20 each, you can now obtain the very same tokens for less than $1 in mid-2020.Nevertheless, if you do want to get your hands on KuCoin Shares you can do this by exchanging them at the platform for an alternative cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum.Fiat Currency Facilities at KuCoinAs the end of 2018, KuCoin has since formed a partnership with European-based payment provider Simplex. The partnership ensures that users from over 100 countries can now deposit real-world funds with a debit or credit card.This is ideal if you are looking to trade cryptocurrencies, futures at KuCoin but you do not have any digital currencies available to you. Instead, you can simply enter your debit/credit card details and get cash directly into the platform. Purchase crypto with credit cardWith that being said, it is important to note that the fees associated with this are not cheap. Although the occasional promotion is offered on deposit fees, this will cost you a whopping 2.5 – 3.5% (with a $10 minimum).This means that a $1000 debit/credit card deposit would cost you $25 in fees. It is noticed that this is slightly cheaper than the likes of Coinbase, which charges 3.99% (with various minimums in place).Also, KuCoin is developing an OTC Trading Desk, on which all users could buy and sell major coins like BTC, USDT, PAX without any fee. The OTC platform currently supports USD, CAD, CNY, IDR and VND.Trading PlatformsKuCoin offers a proprietary trading platform that was built from the ground-up. There is no requirement to download or install any software to your desktop device, as the KuCoin trading arena can be accessed through your standard web browser. The platform is potentially suited to both newbie investors and seasoned traders.The reason we say this is that while the platform is super-clean and easy to navigate through, there are heaps of advanced tools available at your disposal. In fact, you have the ability to fully customize your KuCoin trading screen however you see fit. Kucoin Trading ScreenWhen it comes to trading volumes and the availability of liquidity, you should have no concerns at all when trading more popular pairs. You might, however, find that volumes are low on less liquid pairs – especially those involving ERC-20 tokens.Mobile TradingIf you have a tendency to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies on the move, then you might be interested in the KuCoin mobile trading app.The application is available to download on iOS and Android devices. You will have access to most account features on the app, such as placing orders, checking the value of your portfolio, and depositing and withdrawing funds.How Long do Withdrawals Take at KuCoin?In the vast majority of cases, KuCoin will process your withdrawals within 30 minutes of receiving the request. The platform notes that this is automated, and that manual authorization is only required if the size of your deposit is larger than 100,000 times that of the handling fee (mining fee).Once the funds leave KuCoin, they will be transferred to the cryptocurrency wallet address of your choosing. Make sure that the address is valid, as there is nothing that KuCoin can do if you make an error! Kucoin WithdrawalsEarn Interest at KuCoinAn additional feature available at KuCoin is that of its lending program. In its most basic form, you stand the chance of earning interest on your digital currency holdings by loaning it out. The main concept is that the tokens will be used to help fund margin accounts.For example, let’s suppose that a KuCoin trader decides to apply leverage of 10x on an order. For each day that the position is kept open overnight, the trader would need to pay interest. This is because they are trading with more than they have in their account and thus – this comes at a cost. Earn interest lending your cryptocurrencyWith that said, KuCoin has opened its doors to everyday investors by giving you the opportunity to fund margin positions. This is available on several coins – including USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, and many more.In terms of the specific interest rate, this will vary from coin to coin. As an example, by lending out Bitcoin for 28 days, you could be earning an annualized interest rate of 4.83%.If this is something that you are interested in exploring, KuCoin offers a profit estimation calculator. You simply need to specify how much you are willing to lend out, on what digital currency, and for what length of time – and the calculator will advise you how much you can earn.It is important to remember that although the rates of interest on offer are super-competitive, you must consider the risks associated with this. After all, KuCoin is not a regulated cryptocurrency exchange so you must factor this into your risk vs reward model.Is KuCoin Safe?As is the case with all cryptocurrency exchanges, it is crucial that you are able to ascertain whether or not KuCoin is safe. Not only does this include the platform’s regulatory standing, but its internal and external security practices, too.Let’s break these metrics down in more detail.RegulationIn a nutshell, KuCoin is not regulated by any national licensing bodies. This isn’t a major surprise in the cryptocurrency exchange arena, as lots of platforms choose to operate without a license. Whether or not you feel comfortable trading at an unregulated exchange depends on what side of the fence you sit on.For example, if you are the type of trader that prefers to buy and sell cryptocurrency pairs in an anonymous nature, then there is every chance that a platform like KuCoin is suitable for your needs. At the other end of the spectrum, if you are the type of trader that demands a regulatory safeguard of some sort, then KuCoin might not suffice.KYCAs noted above, KuCoin is not required to ask you for any personal information – nor will they demand sensitive identity documents. However, the one exception to this rule is if you plan to deposit funds with a debit or credit card through the Simplex integration.In fact, in order to remain compliant with all relevant laws surrounding anti-money laundering, you will need to upload a copy of your government-issued ID (passport or driver’s license). This is just the nature of the game when using fiat currency at a crypto-exchange.KuCoin Security PracticesIn terms of internal security practices, KuCoin claims to run institutional-grade systems that ensures it keeps crime away from the platform. This is fully supported by a commitment to cold storage.Although the exact percentage is not specified by KuCoin, it is claimed that the vast bulk of client funds are held offline. The remainder is kept in hot wallets to ensure the platform is able to meet its offering of near-instant and automated withdrawals.To date, there have been no publications of KuCoin encountering a major hack of any sort, which is an excellent sign. With that said, you always need to ensure you understand the risks of a potential external hack, as your funds are being stored in wallets that you do not personally control.Also, it is worth noting that in April 2020, KuCoin completed a strategic cooperation with Onchain Custodian, Singapore’s crypto asset custody platform. Onchain Custodian will offer custody service for the safekeeping of KuCoin crypto assets. The custodial funds will be backed by Lockton, the world’s largest private insurance brokerage company. This is believed to further enhance the exchange’s security level.2FABest of all, KuCoin allows you to install two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account. This means that a unique code will be sent to your mobile device whenever you wish to perform key account functions. This includes logging into your account and making a withdrawal request.KuCoin Customer SupportWhen it comes to customer service, the team at KuCoin provides an around the clock support team that operates 24 hours per day – 7 days per week. You can send the team an email, albeit, if you need instant one-on-one support you are best advised to use the live chat facility. Kucoin Customer SupportSentiment on this is somewhat mixed in the public domain. With some users reporting connection times in the seconds, others have noted that waiting times are beyond acceptable. With that said, it all depends on how busy the team is at the time of the request. There is no telephone support service offered.How to get Started at KuCoinLike the sound of KuCoin and think the platform is suitable for your long-term trading needs? If so, we are now going to show you what you need to do to get started with a trading account today.Step 1: Open an AccountTo get the ball rolling, head over to the KuCoin homepage and click on the ‘Sign Up’ button at the top of the screen. You will then be prompted to enter your email address and to choose a strong password.You will need to verify your email address before linking up 2FA via your mobile phone. At this stage of the registration process, you will not be asked for any personal information. Kucoin SignupStep 2: Deposit FundsOnce you have opened your KuCoin account you will then be promoted to deposit some funds. In this respect, you have two options. If you already possess a digital token, you can deposit this straight into KuCoin.Simply head over to the deposit page and search for the respective coin. Then, click on the deposit tab to reveal your unique wallet address for that specific cryptocurrency.Copy the address to your clipboard, head over to your private wallet, specify the number of coins you wish to deposit, and confirm the transaction.Depending on the cryptocurrency you are depositing, it typically takes around 10-20 minutes for the funds to be credited into your KuCoin account.Fiat Currency DepositIf you do not have access to a digital currency, you will need to deposit funds with your debit or credit card. Hover over the ‘Buy Crypto’ button and then click on ‘Buy with Credit Card’.Follow the step-by-step instructions that are presented to you on screen. Crucially, you will be asked to verify your identity before you are able to use your debit/credit card. The end-to-end process is taken care of by Simplex.Step 3: Start TradingAs soon as your KuCoin account has been funded, you are ready to start trading. The specific trading arena that you need will depend on the type of financial instrument you are looking to access. This is because KuCoin separates its cryptocurrency exchange and future derivative platforms.KuCoin Review: The Verdict?In summary, it is clear to see why KuCoin is now one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the space. Not only does it give you access to over 450 cryptocurrency pairs, but you can also trade crypto-specific indexes and Bitcoin futures.Moreover, standard trading fees amount to just 0.1%, which you can reduce by an additional 20% by paying fee with KuCoin Shares. We also like the fact that you can now deposit funds with a debit or credit card, albeit, you will need to bypass a KYC process first.The main gripe that we have with KuCoin is that it is not a regulated entity. While this does mean that you can trade crypto-to-crypto pairs anonymously, your funds are never 100% safe.On the flip side, reports about a KuCoin hack are yet to surface since its inception in 2017 – which is an excellent sign.Visit Kucoin Kucoin     9.2 Ease of Use  10.0/10 Reputation  9.0/10 Fees  9.0/10 Customer Support  9.0/10 Payment Methods  9.0/10 Pros Transparent & Reasonable FeesGood SupportEasy to UseFutures & Margin TradingOptions for Earning Cons Not Regulated   Visit       157,932"

30,Blockonomi,Bitmedia: Innovative Advertising Solutions for Crypto & Blockchain,Nicholas Say,1592207751.0,"The online crypto adspace is a long way from perfect, but Bitmedia is working hard to close the gap.Blockchain and crypto companies face challenges when they create adverts for the online space. Placement is one of them, and many sites are skittish about blockchain, Bitcoin, and cryptos in general.On top of finding platforms to reach their target market, crypto and blockchain companies have to ensure that they get the most out of everything they spend on adverts.Bigger companies can afford to build the image, but start-ups need to know that money spent on adverts turns into revenue.Even though cryptos are becoming more popular all the time, cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused companies still need every advantage in the online advert market. Bitmedia HomepageLet’s take a look at how Bitmedia is working to ensure that blockchain companies have great advertising opportunities, and how it is moving the entire space forward.Bitmedia is Focused on ProgressContents1 Bitmedia is Focused on Progress2 New Tools for Better Crypto Adverts3 Packages by Bitmedia4 Forget the Crypto Ad Ban5 Better Tools for Great Ideas6 Bitmedia Gets ResultsBitmedia is interested in furthering the blockchain and crypto space by making the right connections. Not only does the company want to make every advert matter, it also wants capital to flow to its clients, who need the support for new and innovative ideas.Matvey Diadkov, the CEO of Bitmedia, commented on the progress:“Crypto market has considerably evolved over last years and triggered changes in financial instruments and in approaches to privacy. We as a company see our mission in helping the industry grow by equipping crypto businesses with an easy-to-use and affordable tool for attracting new audience. This update that we’ve been working on for more than 8 months has brought us one step closer to our goal and has provided our clients with a number of significant improvements on the platform.”The strides that Bitmedia has made to improve the crypto ad market over the last year are striking. In addition to adding new tools to ensure that advertisers know their campaigns are getting results, it has been able to penetrate into new advertising venues to help spread the word to a wider audience.New Tools for Better Crypto AdvertsData matters!Bitmedia has created a platform that gives advertisers the ability to drill-down and find out what is really working.In addition to detailed engagement metrics, Bitmedia has introduced simple to understand layouts that allow anyone to see what is working, and what isn’t.Now, it is much easier to manage ad groups, and get the most out of time and money spent. Testing is also simple with Bitmedia so that busy ad execs can make informed decisions without fighting an intelligible platform that wasn’t built with them in mind.In fact, Bitmedia has put A/B testing at the forefront of its design. Any ad campaign will need to be able to backtest what kinds of messages work on a given client base, so the good ideas are allowed to thrive. Dashboard for advertisersBitmedia’s platform allows easy testing of call to actions, messages, graphics, and other visual elements, and a number of other factors. The platform also gives clients great stats of the results, which are simple to interpret.Managing ad groups with the platform is probably going to be an easy process, even if there are loads of variables to keep track of in the campaign. Additionally, HTML5 adverts can be uploaded directly to the platform!Packages by BitmediaWouldn’t it be nice to just do what works the first time around?Bitmedia has created the ‘Packages’ feature, which allows its clients to hit top-performing websites the first time adverts are displayed so that they have a higher chance of hitting their target demographic.These top-flight sites are picked by Bitmedia account managers and selected because they are delivering results to other clients. It is hard to argue with that logic and given Bitmedia’s track record, these ideas get results.The goal of advertising isn’t just to get a logo in front of people while they surf the web. Smaller businesses need to produce real results in the form of new clients converting to their service or backing the development of a new project.The quality of the people who see an advert matters for niche businesses and this is where the Packages feature from Bitmedia comes into focus.Imagine if it was possible to ensure that the people who were viewing an advert would have an active interest in the business that was spending money to promote its products or ideas.By putting ads in front of people who want to support blockchain and crypto companies, Bitmedia is giving new and growing companies a great way to connect with a supportive community.Forget the Crypto Ad BanMost people in the world still don’t know the difference between ETH and XRP, let alone that there are more tokens out there than Bitcoin. It might seem odd, but it is the state of the market right now.While this is positive for the industry, as it means that there is loads of room to grow, advertisers in the crypto and blockchain industry need to put their message into venues where the adverts are welcome and will drive revenue.When advertising on Bitmedia, there are no restrictions that will limit the message that is being promoted or any filters that reduce the click-through rate.These specialized solutions are vital for an industry that will likely see increasing push-back from established players as tokens and decentralized technology make an even larger impact on how society works.Better Tools for Great IdeasInnovative tools are wonderful, but only if they deliver real-world results.Bitmedia’s platform has powerful case studies to show that not only is it a solid platform that delivers professional tools, but it is also capable of driving traffic to clients’ websites.In one such example, Bitmedia helped Bitcoin Marketing Team (BMT) boost both clicks and impressions and was able to become one of the top three performing channels in a campaign.Bitmedia also helped BMT boost traffic by as much as 700%.According to Jamie McCormick, Managing Director at BMT,“We’ve worked with Bitmedia with several clients over the years, but in this particular case, we worked with our account manager to build out a very targeted list of high performing sites, white list these, use UTM tracking with the macros for identifying publishers, and then our own approach to tracking through the conversion funnel all the way to sales.”Bitmedia Gets ResultsBitmedia is ready to help companies that want to develop and grow in the blockchain and cryptos space. It is also working on an upgrade that will allow its clients to best utilize their advert budget by combining all the providers in a single unit.All of these features should be up and running in the near future, which is great news for anyone who needs to use a results-driven crypto advert platform. According to Bitmedia, most of these upgrades should be working by Q2 2020.If you need to get results from your next crypto or blockchain-focused ad campaign, it would be worth digging a little deeper into Bitmedia.

31,Blockonomi,What Are Watchtowers in Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?,Brian Curran,1591857627.0,"Watchtowers were conceptualized within the original Lightning Network (LN) paper and have since been improved and optimized as Bitcoin’s LN looks to scale into a global P2P payments network.Watchtowers are essentially an ecosystem of third-parties that users employ to outsource monitoring of on-chain transactions relevant to their lightning channels.Watchtowers effectively act as ‘watchdogs’ of the blockchain to identify and penalize malicious actors for cheating other users within channels. They evaluate whether or not a participant in an LN channel has improperly broadcast a prior channel state, which could be used to reclaim funds after closing the channel with an invalid state.For their services, they receive fees from users, and several monetization methods could be deployed. Users can even outsource channel monitoring to multiple watchtower services in case one fails.Recent developments like compact-client side filtering — used in the Neutrino protocol — reduce the overall burden that watchtowers need to take on, but they provide a crucial role in the LN environment — particularly with scaling.Prudent LN users need to check-in on the status of their off-chain channels correlating to on-chain activity every once in a while, and watchtowers provide a 24/7 hedge against security risks posed by invalid channel states.Bitcoin’s LN takes a privacy-oriented approach, so mitigating the ability of watchtowers to link transactions to specific channels is vital, and several innovations have a direct effect on the mesh network’s ability to scale and maintain privacy.How Watchtowers WorkWatchtowers are third-parties that monitor the Bitcoin blockchain 24/7 on behalf of their clients.They look for discrepancies between on-chain transactions and closing off-chain channels with invalid states. Every off-chain LN channel payment requires a valid commitment that creates a current state of the channel balance. The state can be updated by either party in a channel and is updated by the next iterative commitment accompanying a transfer.A path of commitments indicates the channel’s balance state, but a counterparty can broadcast past (invalid) balance states if they stand to benefit better from those states — as in they would have more BTC on their end of the channel. Such scenarios can arise if party A broadcasts a previous balance state following an outgoing transaction to party B in the channel that reduces party A’s balance.Due to the nature of timing constraints within a channel (i.e., HTLCs), a channel participant needs to wait a specific period before claiming funds in their wallet.However, this requires that the users remain online periodically to verify that an invalid state was not broadcast and that a counterparty is not acting maliciously.This presents evident inconveniences for most people who simply do not have the time nor technical expertise to realize such adverse situations or remain consistently online.Enter watchtowers. A watchtower monitors the blockchain 24/7 by remaining online on behalf of the user in return for fees. Therefore, users can be assured that they are not being cheated while they are offline.The basic flow of how a simple watchtower mechanism works between two participants in a single payment channel is as follows:Alice updates the state channel by sending Bob 1 BTC within their channel.Alice concurrently sends a ‘hint’ or ‘secret’ of a specific transaction to a watchtower indicating a specific transaction to look out for without revealing the transaction contents.Alice’s signature sent to the watchtower pre-authorizes the channels funds to be sent back to her in case of a breach.The watchtower cross-references the ‘hints’ with a hash table of hints it receives from its clients and the Bitcoin blockchain.If the watchtower detects a channel breach by Bob via invalid state broadcast, then it constructs a penalty transaction using Alice’s signature and returns the channel funds to her.Alice is subsequently protected from a channel breach without having to be online, and watchtowers cannot link state updates to specific channels.However, problems with the above example are quite distinct when you consider that broadcasting former channel states is not always performed with malicious intent. If a software bug causes Bob to broadcast an invalid channel state that is penalized by a watchtower, he loses all of his funds in the channel — a harsh penalty.Developers came up with a solution to protect against such scenarios with a proposal called eltoo. Essentially, eltoo creates two transactions for every channel state: an update transaction and settlement transaction. Using this structure, a chain of repeating invalidations of previous channel states update to a new state in a chain of time-locked transactions.Importantly, counterparties have time to respond to previous state broadcasts, providing them with the opportunity to mitigate the settlement of a channel with a prior state.However, such a model would lead to the requirement of the chain of transactions to be broadcast to the Bitcoin blockchain, and an updated BIP proposal that corrected the issue called sighash_noinput is under consideration for inclusion into the Bitcoin protocol under BIP-0118 as a soft fork.Watchtowers play an important role in helping Bitcoin’s LN to scale, as they act as the persistent line of defense against channel cheating. However, they face some economic hurdles and monetization methods are still under construction and ideation.Economics, Monetization and ChallengesWatchtowers would have to function as businesses because they retain operational overhead, are affected and constrained by user bases, and deploy monetization models. The two prevailing monetization methods for watchtowers are penalty transactions fees or subscription services.Watchtower services operate with overhead regarding bandwidth, computation, and disk space. With the privacy-preserving LN implementation that Bitcoin uses, watchtowers need to store all previous channel states of their clients, which can lead to ballooning costs in storage space.Where bandwidth and computation can scale with growing watchtower user bases, the potential challenge lays with the quadratically increasing growth problem for disk space requirements. Large-scale watchtowers would need to have enough resources to store millions or billions of ‘blobs’ (i.e., state data). As the user base increases, the amount of saved states increases quadratically, leading to high operational costs for the business in the form of data storage.However, the size of the stored data is tiny — blobs are akin to the size of a Tweet —  so watchtowers that effectively scale with sufficient capital can meet the demand. Large-scale watchtower operations are thus a likely development in the ecosystem. Watchtower operations can sustain profits through subscription-based services, which would actually allow their revenue to scale parallel to the usage of their service.This also presents long-term considerations in the adverse power of large watchtower operations to potentially surveil the LN and Bitcoin ecosystem via channel and transaction mapping. Hurdles facing watchtowers include the convoluted connection between privacy and scalability in the watchtower ecosystem. Users can mitigate the surveillance capabilities of sizeable, colluding watchtowers by connecting to numerous services, but it is unclear how the market for watchtowers will play out and whether that will provide a sufficient hedge against privacy intrusions.Another proposed monetization model is via a portion of the penalty transactions that the watchtowers take as fees. However, the incentives for such a model are misaligned as watchtowers would be incentivized for more breaches, contrary to the mindset of LN users who want as few breaches as possible. A proposed alternative solution comes in the form of the Olympus server, which performs watchtower services via storage tokens — among other LN wallet maintenance features.The watchtower market is not developed yet as the LN is still progressing into a larger P2P payments network on top of Bitcoin. However, the research and innovations in the field provide some compelling narratives for a future ecosystem of LN watchtowers. It remains unclear how much partiality users will place on using the services of watchtowers, but their security assurances can prove vital against offline channel threats — something that prudent users should take into account.Eventually, the ideal marketplace of watchtower services would have the complex technical components abstracted away from the end-user, but significant progress is necessary before that desired level of LN features can be achieved. Bitcoin’s LN continues to snowball with increasing user adoption, channel balances, and innovation. Watchtowers present a forward-thinking approach to security risks posed by the evolving ecosystem of Bitcoin’s novel second layer.    9,109"
32,Blockonomi,Bitamp: Free Open Source Bitcoin Wallet Gives Users a Competitive Edge,Oliver Dale,1591856999.0,"Bitamp, a new client side open source free Bitcoin wallet, allows users to create a new wallet in seconds.The Bitamp sign up and sign in processes are instant, instead of the annoying username, password, and 2FA set up and KYC onboarding processes that more centralized services require.In addition, since there are no usernames and passwords, users can know that rest assured, even if they are SIM swapped by a growing number of cybercriminals, their Bitamp account will never be associated with an email, password or phone number. Instead, their Bitcoin wallet will only correlate to a 12 word seed phrase that no one else has previously seen.The beauty of Bitamp is that when you lose your phone or your 2FA authenticator or access to your email, your Bitcoin will still be recoverable. Bitamp Bitcoin WalletThe fact that Bitamp’s wallet is not correlated to any other personally identifiable information such as one’s name or social security number will let the user know that rest assured, no subpoena or hack will allow their information or funds to be exposed.This all boils down to users’ control over their own funds. Not having access to one’s private key or seed puts one at risk of losing one’s Bitcoin.Time and time again, crypto exchanges and custodial wallets have been hacked, dissolved or become insolvent; leaving their members with empty wallets. Users must understand that although it may be easy to buy Bitcoin on exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance, taking control of your Bitcoin means withdrawing and holding one’s Bitcoin in one’s own non-custodial wallet.Custody of one’s own assets means financial independence.How to Obtain BitcoinBitamp’s step by step guide outlines how people can obtain Bitcoin such as on exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken.Before you can buy Bitcoin users will always need a cryptocurrency wallet. Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken already have built-in digital wallets.However, these wallets are “custodial” wallets meaning that users do not have their own private keys and sole access to their funds. For all the users know, these exchanges could be lending out their Bitcoin to crypto companies for an interest rate or doing whatever they’d like with the funds.Bitamp’s Value PropositionBitamp offers a very convenient bitcoin wallet for beginners to withdraw their Bitcoin from traditional crypto exchanges. Although the novice crypto users has probably used at least one exchange, exchange wallets are a convenient but unsafe place to store Bitcoin.Hardware wallets are known for their superior security and privacy layers. Whereas digital wallets are quicker to use, and usually preferable if you want to just buy cryptocurrency fast or sell it fast.Hardware wallets used in conjunction with Bitamp provide protection to the user’s digital funds by keeping their private keys on a secure device. Unlike traditional crypto wallets which are entirely software-based, a hardware wallet, or cold storage wallet, stores private keys offline.This means that unless the user is using the wallet to check their balance or make cryptocurrency transactions, the user’s keys are anonymous or private. Only when they use the wallet to generate a key, can a transaction be authenticated online.Users may benefit from using Bitamp over Coinbase, for example, because there is no upper limit of funds that the user can withdraw at one time. Most times on centralized exchanges, to remove that limit, users have to complete the identity verification process.This means that if you wish for more anonymity, users cannot expect to transfer large amounts of cryptocurrency at once on centralized exchanges. The good news for Bitamp users is that users can withdraw however much Bitcoin they’d like without KYC.As many more businesses start to accept crypto payments, non-custodial wallets will also grow in terms of utility without having to interface with custodial exchanges and wallets that have fiat gateways.In the future, Bitamp used in conjunction with hardware wallets such as Ledger, Trezor or KeepKey will be all users need to transact in the modern day Bitcoin-enabled economy.    3,560"

34,Blockonomi,Comparing Ethereum vs Bitcoin: What are the Differences?,Brian Curran,1591709657.0,"Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most well-known cryptocurrencies today, with the former the legacy cryptocurrency created by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and the latter proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013.Although both cryptocurrencies have several similarities, their designs are distinctly different and the application of their networks are tailored towards different use cases.Understanding the key differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum can provide a better grasp on the broader cryptocurrency and blockchain industry as a whole, as they are both integral components of the market with large open-source communities and influential developments.Comparing the Differences Between Bitcoin and EthereumContents1 Comparing the Differences Between Bitcoin and Ethereum2 Transaction Schemes3 Comparing BTC & ETH Monetary Policy4 Smart Contracts and Scripting Functionality5 Mining/Consensus/Developments6 Narrative & Practical Applications7 Future Roadmaps8 ConclusionThe main difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum stems from their conceptual design.Bitcoin is predicated on becoming a secure, censorship-resistant value system outside of the traditional financial realm while Ethereum is designed as a ‘decentralized world computer’ where Turing-complete functionality enables users to build and run applications on the network through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).There are numerous subtle differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, but generally analyzing the primary variations requires evaluating the following:Transaction SchemesMonetary PolicySmart Contract and Scripting FunctionalityMining/Consensus/DevelopmentNarrative & Practical ApplicationsTransaction SchemesBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum employ public-key cryptography for authenticating transactions that are validly signed by the party who retains control of the private keys to access the native cryptocurrency on each network, BTC and ETH, respectively. However, they differ in the structure of their transaction models.Bitcoin uses what’s called an ‘unspent transaction output’ scheme known as UTXO. Transactions are all linked together in a chain of inputs and outputs, with unspent outputs representing the ‘funds’ that an individual — with a corresponding private key that unlocks a specific amount of BTC — can use to spend as inputs in a new transaction.Users do not technically own specific BTC, but instead, hold the right to spend a precise amount of unspent transaction outputs in the network. Bitcoin uses ECDSA as its digital signature algorithm for its public-key encryption, and senders digitally sign the hash of a previous transaction in combination with the recipient’s public key to validly construct a transaction.Conversely, Ethereum uses an account-based model more similar to traditional checking accounts with a bank. Addresses (public keys) in Ethereum contain the transaction information for each ‘account’ where an update to that specific account is considered a state transition.There are two types of account in Ethereum:Contract AccountsExternally Owned AccountsContract accounts are smart contracts that are run by code and programmed to receive, store, and contact other accounts in the network based on certain inputs.Externally owned accounts are controlled by users and can send and receive transactions, and sign them with their private keys.Notably, Ethereum uses ‘gas’ a derivative of the native currency Ether which is appropriated to pay for transactions and computational execution across the network, mainly designed to mitigate spam. Ethereum also uses the ECDSA digital signature algorithm for transactions.Overall, Bitcoin’s UTXO design is useful for the broader consensus of the network, as all inputs and outputs are linked to each other, and it also provides a more straightforward design of interlocking accounting records that are timestamped in the blockchain.Ethereum selected an account-based model for more considerable space savings, constant light client reference, and other advantages found here. The transactions schemes for both are designed to fit the mold of what each network is attempting to accomplish.Read: Comparing Bitcoin & Ethereum: UTXO vs Account Based Transaction ModelsComparing BTC & ETH Monetary PolicyThe differences in monetary policy are some of the most profound and often overlooked variances between Bitcoin and Ethereum.Bitcoin’s monetary policy has been set since its creation and is governed by the total cap on the number of BTC available (21 million), halving of block rewards roughly every four years, and the difficulty adjustment of the mining target to ensure a consistent release of blocks approximately every ten minutes.Bitcoin’s emission rate correlates directly to mining, as miners receive newly minted BTC as a block reward for winning the lottery-like consensus round every ten minutes. The emission is deflationary and equates to a diminishing issuance over time.As a result, Bitcoin is often referred to as ‘digital gold’ because of its high stock-to-flow ratio and scarcity of BTC. Bitcoin’s cemented monetary policy is one of its cardinal advantages.Ethereum’s monetary policy is more fluid and has not been entirely set in stone yet. While Ethereum still uses mining similar to Bitcoin in a PoW scheme — also with a difficulty adjustment to ensure blocks are created roughly every 12 seconds rather than 10 minutes –, there is an ongoing debate about the network’s monetary policy as the network looks to transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus.Currently, the circulating supply of ETH is roughly 104,500,000 with a decaying emission targeting low inflation. However, in the Ethereum 2.0 proposed roadmap — known as Serenity — the rough consensus around the emission rate for PoS is between a target of 0.5 – 2 percent and perpetual inflation will accumulate proportionally to ETH holders that choose to stake their ETH as validators.Bitcoin’s concrete monetary policy is a distinct advantage over Ethereum, as the Ethereum community has prioritized other network components over solidifying its monetary policy throughout the last several years.The transition to PoS is an enormous move by Ethereum, which will be one of the major restructuring projects to watch closely in the broader cryptocurrency sector.Smart Contracts and Scripting FunctionalityBitcoin has a stripped down and simple scripting language that can be leveraged for useful mechanisms like multi-sig transactions and certain wallet features, but Ethereum is designed explicitly for facilitating Turing-complete smart contracts and decentralized applications on its network.The eventual growth of sidechains on Bitcoin — like RSK — should confer Turing-complete smart contract functionality to a sidechain tethered to the Bitcoin blockchain, but sidechains are still in their early stages.Ethereum is the first smart contracts platform with an emphasis on developers building applications (dapps) that run on its decentralized virtual machine. Dapps differ from traditional applications primarily in that they are censorship-resistant, and Ethereum has seen numerous dapps from prediction markets like Augur to collectible games like Cryptokitties since its inception.Dapps have some interesting implications, but the lack of scalability of decentralized, public blockchain networks at the moment has hindered their adoption, hence, why Ethereum is transitioning to PoS consensus, to enable scalable dapps that can rival centralized applications in performance.Mining/Consensus/DevelopmentsBitcoin and Ethereum both are PoW-based public blockchain networks where miners compete to create blocks in an open and competitive market. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 mining algorithm while Ethereum currently uses the Ethash algorithm.ASIC miners are available for mining both algorithms, and the mining markets for Ethereum and Bitcoin are similarly dominated by large mining pools.The PoW consensus of Bitcoin and Ethereum allowed both of them to aggregate hash power over the years and become more secure, decentralized networks. PoW mining is an elegant method of money issuance that mitigates against the arbitrary inflation of a currency by creating an open market for mining and confers censorship-resistance to algorithmically predetermined issuance rates of the currency.However, PoW mining is exceptionally challenging to bootstrap as it requires establishing network effects and incentivizing miners to mine on the network. Additionally, it is not ideal for Ethereum’s scalability as a smart contracts platform because of its slow on-chain throughput capacity and is why Ethereum is slowly transitioning to a PoS model which enables faster consensus on the network’s state.Ethereum’s PoS will not be fully implemented for the next couple of years, so it is impossible to project how it will turn out, but many core community members view it as the necessary step for the smart contracts platform.The scalability problems of Ethereum and Bitcoin have also led to layer two scaling solutions, like Bitcoin’s LN and Ethereum’s Raiden Network. Bitcoin’s scaling challenges are less complicated than Ethereum due to the more substantial complexity of the Ethereum network.Additional proposals for layer two scaling of Ethereum include Plasma and dappchains which would supplement the on-chain throughput of the network by localizing consensus to specific dapps and childchains tethered to the root chain.Read: Plasma & The Raiden Network: Ethereum Scaling Solutions ExplainedConsensus is also critical from the development perspective. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum use open-source improvement proposals from the community.These are BIPs for Bitcoin and EIPs for Ethereum.Users and developers can contribute to both and governance take the shape of an off-chain ‘rough consensus’ for both networks rather than a baked-in on-chain governance protocol. Bitcoin and Ethereum retain the two largest open-source communities in the cryptocurrency sector.The two communities differ slightly in their approaches, however. Bitcoin’s community has taken a prudent approach emphasizing conservative changing of core components of the protocol in an effort to maintain robustness and sustainability. Ethereum’s open-source community and lead devs are more focused on adapting to network needs by implementing more liberal upgrades/changes to the network, as indicated by the planned shift to PoS consensus.Time will tell how well Ethereum’s transition plays out, but Bitcoin’s resilience and conservative approach have proven a successful recipe for sustainability for over a decade. Ethereum’s more significant changes come with inherent risk but also potential opportunity to evolve dynamically.Narrative & Practical ApplicationsBitcoin’s narrative has evolved from a fringe digital currency to a high-value settlement layer and digital gold that has a penchant for resilience in the face of persistent criticism, skepticism, and misperceptions. It has become a viable alternative means of value storage and transfer outside of the traditional financial realm and is primarily an invention of money.Bitcoin users are usually professionally involved with the legacy cryptocurrency or ideologically predisposed to use it out of general aversion to inflationary fiat currencies, or simply use it out of curiosity or necessity.Bitcoin’s community emphasize privacy, robustness, and censorship-resistance, which have led to some innovative developments and applications of Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s on-chain throughput is not sufficient to support a digital P2P payments network, but the continual progression of its second layer Lightning Network (LN) has the potential to change that.Ethereum’s community is focused on building a scalable smart contracts platform that is also censorship-resistant and can provide the foundation for a new generation of applications. Ethereum is useful for making dapps that have various use cases. Digital collectibles are provably scare and immutable for games, prediction markets are censorship-resistant, and intermediaries can be removed from sharing economy business models.Dapps on Ethereum — or any other smart contracts platform — have endemically poor user numbers, so the eventual outcome of Ethereum’s transition to PoS weighs heavily on the success of the platform as a viable means for building, running, and using dapps.Future RoadmapsThe future roadmaps of Bitcoin and Ethereum are chock-full of innovative ideas and upgrades to the core protocols.Efficiency and privacy enhancements are the focus of many future Bitcoin upgrades, including the long-awaited incorporation of Schnorr signatures into the protocol and network-layer privacy protections like Dandelion++.Similarly, the LN is poised to continue growing, bringing with it a massive design space for more applications and payment capabilities for merchants looking to use Bitcoin. The proliferation of sidechains — like RSK and Liquid — is also a trend to watch closely in the coming years.Ethereum’s transition to PoS is clearly the most significant development with the smart contracts platform. The change will come in multiple steps, including the upcoming Constantinople upgrade and eventually the fully live PoS Serenity completion.There are other developments for Ethereum on the horizon too. The potential inclusion of zk-SNARKs into the network can improve efficiency and privacy across the network, and future bridges to networks like Cosmos and Polkadot can help to supplement Ethereum’s scalability.ConclusionBitcoin and Ethereum are the two most established cryptocurrencies today. Bitcoin as the novel digital currency that started a movement, and Ethereum as the smart contracts platform striving to be the foundation for a new generation of applications.Comparing their primary differences allows you to understand what defines the narrative and benefits of both cryptocurrencies.There are many more nuanced technical differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, and as always, it is best to do your own research when evaluating cryptocurrencies.    12,041"
35,Blockonomi,Five Coinbase Alternatives Where You Can Trade 24/7,Oliver Dale,1591709443.0,"Coinbase has a problem. In fact it has several, including celebrity users disgruntled with its poor customer service and a scandal over its development of chain analysis software for US government agencies, both of which have occurred in the past month.Regular users of the crypto brokerage and exchange have a more pressing concern, however: when they badly need to access their account, they can’t.The San Francisco-headquartered exchange has gained a reputation for going offline during times of peak volatility. Just as volume is rocketing across global exchanges, Coinbase is nowhere to be seen.Its latest outage occurred on June 1, just as bitcoin was soaring past $10k, and there was a similar incident in March when BTC plummeted during a series of cascading liquidations on the futures market.For traders seeking a trading venue that can take the strain, here are five robust Coinbase alternatives.1.  bitFlyer USAContents1 1.  bitFlyer USA2 2.  Bybit3 3.  Huobi4 4.  Kraken5 5.  BitMaxbitFlyer USA is now doing in the States what its parent exchange has done in Japan: provided retail customers with a dependable platform for trading cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and LTC. bitFlyer HomepageLicensed, and appropriately regulated to operate in numerous US states, bitFlyer enables traders to buy and sell digital currencies for US dollars safely, with low fees and latency. It’s reliable, too, with a trading engine that keeps ticking over, even when the markets turn choppy.bitFlyer’s Lightning Pro exchange, meanwhile, provides even faster order execution and an advanced interface for experienced traders.2.  BybitBybit has a number of advantages over Coinbase, including the provision of leveraged trading of its BTC, ETH, EOS, and XRP contracts.For Coinbase users frustrated at being unable to trade during peak times, however, Bybit’s best feature has to be its trading engine which can handle 100,000 transactions per second, matching each trade within 10 microseconds. Bybit HomepageOn Black Thursday, March 13, when BitMEX’s exchange went down, Bybit kept on trucking, winning a slew of new signups in the aftermath.3.  HuobiThe only exchange that can lay a glove on Binance in terms of volume and global reach, Huobi is a powerhouse. The exchange dominates the Asian market and also has a foothold in Europe and the US. HuobiSpot and margin trading are complemented by an OTC desk and institutional arm for high volume traders. There’s a reason why you rarely hear traders complaining about Huobi when bitcoin’s on a bull run: because the exchange just works.4.  KrakenUS traders seeking a direct alternative to Coinbase should look no further than Kraken. Despite being headquartered in the same state as Coinbase, California’s Kraken is cut from a very different cloth, despite being subject to the same regulations.You wouldn’t catch CEO Jesse Powell selling chain analysis software to the DEA for one thing; Kraken is a more privacy-oriented platform. In terms of uptime, Kraken also performs admirably. Kraken HomepageFollowing the bull run of 2017, when every major exchange struggled with the unprecedented demand, Kraken upgraded its trading engine and has been ticking over smoothly ever since.5.  BitMaxBitMax is another popular exchange within the Asian and European markets that’s modeled on the Binance model, including a native token for discounted fees, margin trading, and staking. BitMax HomepageThere’s a lot more altcoins to trade than on Coinbase, even if the liquidity on smaller cap coins can sometimes lead a little to be desired. An efficient trading engine ensures orders are rapidly executed and performance remains stable during peak times.If you’re a Coinbase regular who’s grown frustrated at the sporadic outages, don’t prolong your suffering: take your coins to a more reliable exchange that won’t start to groan when the going gets tough.Most exchanges suffer performance issues from time to time. Frequent outages, however, should not be tolerated. With more crypto exchanges today than ever, you’ve no excuse for now withdrawing your coins from Coinbase and seeking your fortune elsewhere.    3,284"
36,Blockonomi,What is Sound Money? A Look at Bitcoin’s Emergence,Brian Curran,1591621256.0,"Throughout history, there have various iterations of sound money, from the Rai stones of the Yap islands to the gold standard.However, sound money has remained elusive over the last century following the proliferation of credit expansion through central banking fractional-reserve policies that lead to endemic inflation.Sound money is consistently touted as a necessary prerequisite to a prosperous society and a stable price mechanism in free market economies by the Austrian School of economics.Eminent figures such as FA Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and Carl Menger detailed the root causes of ‘boom and bust’ economic cycles as the extended inflationary monetary policies that have come to dominate government direction since the 1930s.FA Hayek even went so far as to presciently describe a new kind of currency that would be free from government control in 1984 as the only true means of achieving good, sound money again.Since then, Bitcoin has emerged not only as sound money but perhaps exists among the hardest currencies created, made for the digital age.Adequately understanding sound money is vital to comprehending the fundamental advantages of Bitcoin and why its novelty is often challenging to accept or comprehend after a prolonged period of global fiat dominance.As a side note, if you have a chance to read The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous, I would highly recommend it, no matter what your background is, as it provides some crucial context on sound money and Bitcoin’s place in monetary history.What Defines Sound Money?Contents1 What Defines Sound Money?2 How Bitcoin Is Sound Money3 ConclusionThe history of money is both enormously impactful on today’s conception of value and how sound money emerges naturally in a civilization. Examples of such sound money extend back to ancient societies, including the Yapese Rai stones and the gold Solidus of the Byzantine Empire.Nick Szabo provides an excellent analysis of the ancient beginnings of value systems with his distinguished piece; Shelling Out: The Origins of Money.Szabo details how money evolved from collectibles that were scarce and carried sentimental value or represented significant effort to acquire as some of the earliest origins of money.Read: Crypto Profiles: Nick Szabo, The Quiet Cryptocurrency PioneerMoney emerges to provide a solution to the Coincidence of Wants problem where an intermediary store of value that is salable across time and space is necessary to facilitate a growing economy.Moreover, sound money needs to retain value over time, function as a medium of exchange, and be highly divisible to function at scale.Ammous references that for money to be sound, it needs to be hard rather than easy. Easy money is what constitutes national fiat currencies today as their supply can easily be expanded, drastically reducing their value over time and making them a highly ineffective store of value.The USD is ‘easy money’ because the Federal Reserve can expand the money supply through inflation as the government sees fit, to expand credit for public spending or bail out industries (i.e., global financial crisis of 2008).Conversely, hard money — such as gold — has a high stock-to-flow ratio, meaning that the supply of the value in existence is significantly higher and consistently maintains a high ratio of how much is in circulation compared to how much can be injected into the circulation over any given period.Gold achieves this not solely because it is rare, but because of the time and effort that is required to mine it is profound, making the introduction of more gold into the global gold supply relatively consistent and very low compared to the overall amount already available. As such, gold cannot be easily inflated and subsequently devalued.Sound money is hard money that is highly divisible, salable across time and space, and leads to a low-time preference of participants in free market economies. A low time-preference leads to the accumulation of capital through savings and the eventual flourishing of production and technological advance.Historically, gold is the most well-established sound money that has existed as a means of value in virtually every civilized economy since the Romans in one form or another.The gold standard provides a stable price mechanism for international trade to function without the incessant need for competing devaluation of nationalized currencies that is so prevalent today (i.e., China and the U.S.).Read: Crypto & Gold: Two Magic Bullets to Beat Recessions & the Fed says Ron PaulWithout sound money, people’s savings, consumer prices, and the overall economic direction of a country are at the whims of the entity that controls the money supply, which today, are ubiquitously governments.An important caveat of central government banking that is widely overlooked or misunderstood is that central banks continue to hoard gold. If they believed in the value of their fiat currencies as sound money, there would be no need to hoard gold, yet they still do, which is extremely telling.Gold is not a perfect means of sound money either, however. While it retains value over time and is widely acknowledged as the best store of value, it is not very divisible or convenient to transfer between parties, let alone for average people to hold it securely without custodial services.Bitcoin emphatically represents sound money for the digital age, and while it is still very young, presents an undeniably fascinating case for a new form of value that is resistant to inflation, outside of the control of any single entity, highly divisible, and transferable to nearly anywhere on the globe, wifi connection or not.How Bitcoin Is Sound MoneyOne of the best ways to view Bitcoin is as the first legitimate competition to central banking in the last century. Governments — and nobody for that matter — can control or destroy Bitcoin, introducing the notion of competition to an industry that has been dominated by Keynesian monetary policy for decades.Bitcoin meets all of the prerequisites for sound money and is built for the digital age of the Internet, a vast improvement in transferability and personal sovereignty of value.The amount of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million and is governed by an algorithm that cannot be fleetingly altered to inject more Bitcoin at a rate more than the elegant and predetermined value that is built into the protocol, which halves roughly every 4 years.As such, Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio gradually increases, meaning that its stock-to-flow ratio will eventually reach an immense level once the last bitcoins are issued through mining. That is the definition of hard money.Read: What is Bitcoin, Ultimate GuideBitcoin is also decentralized, meaning that it is not subject to arbitrary policy decisions or needs of governments, third-parties, or malicious actors intent on destroying it as there is no single point of failure.Further, Bitcoin is governed by a social consensus layer, where the users determine what Bitcoin is, and the protocol just enforces the abstractly agreed-upon rules of the community sentiment.The incentive design of Bitcoin also leads to a self-sustaining economy of miners that adjust to Bitcoin’s difficulty algorithm, one of its most defining characteristics.Bitcoin as a means of value exchange is unprecedented. There has never existed a mechanism for transferring sums of value — large or small — to other parties across the world with settlement in minutes.Moreover, if you retain control of your private keys, the available funds are instantly yours, and there is no need to deal with trusted intermediaries, mitigating any capacity for censorship.This is the primary advantage that Bitcoin holds over gold as it is divisible into a satoshi unit that can be transferred without custodial services at the discretion of the users through the disintermediation of trust.Privacy also has profound implications for mitigating coercive control. The cypherpunks touted cryptography as the last legitimate means to preserve privacy in a digital age, and Bitcoin’s uncanny use of cryptographic primitives is a testament to the desire of many to transact privately and free from outside control.ConclusionWhile Bitcoin’s privacy is not perfect, it is constantly evolving, and the community has shown a strong preference to enhance its privacy-preserving properties continuously.Perhaps most importantly, sound money provides the foundation for personal sovereignty that removes the need for reliance on policies that affect value outside the control of individuals.Rather than relying on centrally directed and whimsical designs, users of Bitcoin retain what is theirs, and are free from the undue influence of others and subject only to the organic mechanics of a free market.Sound money has evolved throughout history. To view government issued fiat as the final destination of what constitutes value is to ignore the dynamic nature of technology and the willingness of people to protect the fundamental principles that they strongly believe in.    9,192"
37,Blockonomi,What Are Bitcoin Futures? Complete Beginner’s Guide,Brian Curran,1591189215.0,"As speculation of regulatory guidelines and institutional investment in cryptocurrencies continues to unfold, keeping up with all of the developments can be challenging.However, Bitcoin futures have been available since the end of 2017, and they are increasingly available on regulated exchanges. They also may potentially impact regulatory decisions on further financial instruments for Bitcoin, such as ETFs.For investors looking to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without having to actually own any directly, Bitcoin futures provide a viable, regulated means to do so effectively. Further, futures can help hedge against risk against the volatile price fluctuations of Bitcoin.What Are Futures Contracts?Contents1 What Are Futures Contracts?2 What Are Bitcoin Futures?3 Platforms Offering Bitcoin Futures Trading4 Bitcoin Futures’ Role in Further Regulatory ProgressionFinancial futures are contracts that specify the buying or selling of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on a precise date in the future. Counterparties are obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract upon expiration, either buying or selling the asset at the price once the contract expires.Parties can take two positions in a futures contract; long or short. Long means that the party agrees to buy the underlying asset in the future at a specific price, while short means the party agrees to sell the underlying asset at a specific price upon the contract’s expiration in the future.Futures contracts are traded on regulated exchanges and are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). They are regularly used for two purposes:Speculating on the price movement of the underlying asset.Hedging risk.In the first case, a party can purchase a futures contract on a commodity — such as oil — if they anticipate that the price of oil will rise leading up to the expiration date of the contract.For instance, if oil is $50 a barrel at the time of contract’s initiation and the buying party expects the price to rise before the expiration of the contract, they can profit off of the price difference — if the asset increases in price — through cash settlement, or can sell the contract on the spot market later at a higher price.So, if party A buys a futures contract for two barrels of oil at $50 per barrel, and by the time of the contract’s expiration the price rises to $80 per barrel, then party A can make a profit of $60 from the $30 price difference per barrel.Futures are not limited to commodities, however. They can be used as a tool for the speculation on the price of financial assets as well.In the second case, futures contracts are used as a hedge against adverse price movements that would affect an entity that actively uses or produces the underlying asset in the contract.In this way, a party can ensure more stable financial results from their business at the current price rather than suffering losses from adverse price movements.For instance, if the current oil price is $50 per barrel, a shipping company that expects the price of oil to rise can buy a futures contract for 10 barrels at $50 per barrel.Their contract would then be worth $500.Upon the expiration of the contract, if the price of a barrel of oil rose to $60, then the company saved $100, providing a useful mechanism for reducing their exposure to the price movements of oil.Futures contracts often lead to a less volatile price of the underlying asset in the long-term, especially if the futures market for the asset is highly liquid.What Are Bitcoin Futures?Bitcoin futures are futures contracts that speculate on the price of Bitcoin without participants actually having to own Bitcoin.Upcoming futures trading platforms like Bakkt offer physical delivery of the underlying asset for contracts, but it still remains within their custody rather than the purchasing party having to directly buy and sell Bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges and store it in their own wallet.Entities that participate in Bitcoin futures are essentially making a bet on the price of Bitcoin over a specified period. Bitcoin futures work the same way as any futures contract on a traditional financial asset.Investors can either go long on Bitcoin — expecting the price to increase — or short it, mitigating potential losses if they actually own some Bitcoin.For instance, if Bob owns 10 Bitcoin at $5,000 and expects the price of Bitcoin to drop, he can sell (short) a futures contract at the current price of $5,000.If the price drops to $4,000 near the expiration of the contract, then he can buy (long) back the futures, meaning that he protected $10,000 on his investment by selling his contract at a higher price than when he bought at $4,000.Bitcoin futures provide several advantages for investors.First, they are traded on regulated exchanges, making the process much more familiar and comfortable for mainstream and institutional investors who may not want to deal directly with cryptocurrency exchanges.Second, the contracts allow for speculation on the underlying price of the asset without having to go through the process of properly storing bitcoins, which is a high barrier to entry for many people unfamiliar with how Bitcoin works.Third, by granting Bitcoin more exposure to investors, more liquidity is added to the market. Finally, futures trading can lead to less volatility of Bitcoin’s price in the long-term and enable investors to protect themselves from adverse price swings.Institutions are also more likely to offer Bitcoin futures trading to their clients since it is within a regulated exchange and reduces the risks associated with holding bitcoins.Platforms Offering Bitcoin Futures TradingCBOE — one of the largest futures trading platforms in the world — launched the first Bitcoin futures in December 2017, followed by another Chicago-based platform, CME. Since then, several platforms and major institutions have signaled their plans to launch Bitcoin futures, including some cryptocurrency exchanges. Some of the major platforms where you can trade Bitcoin futures include:CBOE – One of the largest futures exchanges in the world. First to launch Bitcoin futures trading.Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group (CME) – Chicago-based derivatives and futures trading exchange. Recently announced that Bitcoin futures trading grew 119 percent throughout 2018 on their platform.BitMEX – One of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Offers Bitcoin futures trading (not available to U.S. citizens).TD Ameritrade – One of the largest brokerage firms in the world. Recently launched Bitcoin futures trading.OKEx – Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency trading platform offering Bitcoin futures — not available to U.S. citizens.Nasdaq – Second largest stock market exchange (by market cap) in the world. Planning on launching Bitcoin futures trading in early 2019.Bakkt – A Bitcoin futures trading and custody platform backed by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) which owns the NYSE.Bitcoin Futures’ Role in Further Regulatory ProgressionBitcoin futures were the first major institutional development concerning the offering of Bitcoin trading within regulated exchanges. Since then, numerous developments have unfolded regarding Bitcoin’s status as an asset as well as the potential offering of Bitcoin ETFs.In particular, the SEC has denied several applications for Bitcoin ETFs already, citing that Bitcoin futures markets are not mature or liquid enough to support Bitcoin ETFs. Moreover, the SEC recently postponed a decision on one of the leading ETF proposals — from VanEck & SolidX — until February.Bitcoin futures trading offers several advantages to investors and should continue to grow as Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a financial asset garners more support by both regulators and investors.Several platforms are already offering futures trading for the legacy cryptocurrency, and the launch of Bakkt is seen as a significant step forward for Bitcoin futures trading among institutional investors.    12,766"

39,Blockonomi,Free Cryptocurrency: Complete Guide to Earning Free Crypto,Daniel Dob,1591083497.0,"The last couple of years have marked an increase in the overall public awareness of cryptocurrencies worldwide. In return, a larger number of people have expressed their interest in purchasing or earning digital currencies.While buying your favorite coin via an exchange is likely the easiest way to enter the cryptocurrency market, this industry is full of surprises – therefore a noticeable amount of coin can be earned for free.As such, this article will cover the main methods that can be leveraged in order to obtain free crypto. Do keep in mind that most of these methods require a bit of effort, since nothing is ever truly free. However, these methods do not entail having to work a fulltime job, nor do they imply any monetary investment from your part.Free Crypto from Coinbase EarnContents1 Free Crypto from Coinbase Earn2 Earning Free Crypto via Airdrops3 Leveraging Bounties for Free Coin3.1 Bug bounties3.2 Signature campaigns3.3 Translations3.4 Social media, images, blog posts and video bounties4 The Earning Potential of Affiliate Marketing and Referrals5 Other Free Crypto Offers5.1 Crypto.com5.2 Celsius Network5.3 Wirex5.4 Cryptocurrency gambling6 Keep an Eye Out for Scams7 The Bottom LineCoinbase is largely seen as one of the most popular digital currency exchanges, especially in the United States.While the platform facilitates the purchase and sale of crypto, it also offers its users the opportunity to earn several coins, including but not limited to Orchid, Tezos, Dai, EOS, Stellar, Zcash, Basic Attention Token and Ox. Free crypto at Coinbase Earn.For example, at the moment you can earn the following cryptos for free:Orchid: users can earn up to $52 OXT by completing a free course meant to teach you the basics of this privacy-focused coin;Tezos: completing a course on Tezos and learning about its openness, safety or upgradability will earn you $6 XTZ;Dai: a similar course-based offer is available for Dai as well, thus granting course participants $20 DAI;EOS: you can earn up to $50 EOS by completing a course on this coin, and learning more about its goal of facilitating the development of blockchain-based apps;Stellar Lumens: the completion of a quick course on how Stellar connects payment systems, banks and individuals will earn you $50 XLM;Zcash: this coin is known for its privacy-focused philosophy – course completion will grant you an undisclosed amount of ZEC tokens;Basic Attention Token: $8-worth of BAT can be earned by reading on BAT’s vision of fixing the web;0x: last but not least, educating yourself on OX’s token-based idea of the future web will award you several ZRX tokens.Do keep in mind that there is a catch to these courses. You must be the holder of a Coinbase exchange account, where all tokens will be credited.Signup for Coinbase EarnEarning Free Crypto via AirdropsAirdrops are one of the simplest and most effective methods of earning extra cryptocurrency, especially in the form of newly-announced tokens. The idea behind airdrops is quite simple – innovative and newly-launched projects choose to hold airdrops as an effective marketing strategy, meant to pique the interest of the cryptocurrency community.Participating in an airdrop is bound to be quite simple. It entails owning an active Ethereum wallet that is ERC-20 compatible, an email address, Telegram account, and in some cases, a Twitter account.Once these criteria are met, you will have to look for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Security Token Offerings (STOs), and token-based start-ups that have announced an upcoming airdrop.Most of these platforms will require you to sign-up, by entering your ERC-20 address and email. For marketing purposes, some airdrops may require you to follow them on Twitter, or join the Telegram chat group. This ensures that you’re kept in the loop and quickly become aware of news concerning the token.Recently, KYC&AML regulations have made it mandatory for numerous airdrops to request identifying details. This is due to the money laundering potential associated with these events. Therefore, if you’re keen on protecting your online privacy, airdrops might not be the best choice for you.Recently, numerous wallet providers such as Blockchain.com have started sponsoring airdrops. Signup for free crypto AirdropsIn other words, you are announced whenever a partner start-up is holding an airdrop of their new tokens, and can earn the tokens directly in your wallet. Similarly, there are numerous websites which scour the web looking for new airdrop events. Following will help ensure that you will be one of the first people to know about upcoming airdrops.Leveraging Bounties for Free CoinBounties are quite similar to airdrops, in the sense that they represent free coins given away by crypto project developers. There’s one key difference, however – bounties generally imply that you do some type of work in exchange for the coin.With this in mind, here are the main types of bounties, alongside a quick description for each:Bug bountiesBug bounty campaigns are generally well-paid, yet they are only relevant to people who hold development skills. Programmers throughout the world actively attempt to crack the code of online platforms, while also testing for potential bugs.As such, crypto and blockchain-based companies may hold bounty campaigns, where developers analyse platform functionality and report any bugs.Over the last couple of years, there have been numerous instances in which white-hat hackers discovered vulnerabilities or significant bugs in web platforms. In return for this service, and based on the severity of the vulnerability discovered, companies can offer tens of thousands of dollars as compensation.Signature campaignsThis marketing strategy is often implemented on forums such as Bitcointalk. In exchange for a monthly bounty, forum users add a specific signature, thus indirectly promoting the products and services of a crypto company.Most businesses holding signature campaigns require forum users to have a higher membership level, which can be obtained through frequent high-quality posts. In return for buying the signature space, companies offer a monthly bounty in tokens. Numerous bounty programs at BitcointalkTranslationsCrypto start-ups are always interested in having their content translated into multiple languages. Since many start-ups run on a limited budget, a good method to go about this is to launch a translation bounty. Here, native users translate specific portions of text, in exchange for a number of tokens.Social media, images, blog posts and video bountiesLast but not least, we also have other promotional bounties. Some companies may ask you to write and post a positive article on their services, whereas others may require you to edit videos, share posts on social media, or create promotional images.Based on these aspects, bounties do, in fact, represent a method of earning free tokens, yet they imply actual work. Luckily, the work is generally quite easy (apart from bug bounties), and can be completed rather quickly.The Earning Potential of Affiliate Marketing and ReferralsAt this point in time, most experts define affiliate marketing as the process associated with promoting products and services of various companies, in exchange for a commission on each sale.A recent research study concluded that US-based affiliate spending may reach $6.8 billion by the end of 2020.As such, affiliate marketing represents a significant revenue stream for numerous companies, especially those which operate in the online ecosystem.Therefore, it only makes sense that numerous crypto and blockchain-related businesses have launched their very own affiliate marketing campaigns. Getting involved is bound to be simple – in most instances, you need an account, and a personalized link, which can be shared across the web.Any service or product that is purchased using your affiliate link or referral code will be credited with a percentage of the sale.Affiliate marketing can earn you free cryptocurrency as long as you are active online. This implies sharing the link as part of valuable content on a variety of platforms, such as crypto discussion forums, Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or your personal blog.The possibilities are endless. Your success depends directly on the size of your audience and your overall online reach. However, this means that actual work needs to be carried out in order to get this free crypto. On the other hand, once your links are live, affiliate marketing becomes a lucrative source of passive income, which can be leveraged for a prolonged period of time.To put things into perspective, here are several crypto-related affiliate campaigns:Coinbase: if new users sign up using your personalized affiliate link, you are eligible to obtain 50% of the fees charged by the exchange platform for all transactions;TREZOR: this platform offers 10% of net sales carried out by users who have signed up using your referral;Ledger: this affiliate program promises to credit 12% – 15% of all sales;LocalBitcoins: you can expect to earn 20% of the trading fee associated with each transaction that is carried out by referred users;Binance: this exchange platform offers 20%-40% commissions on transaction fees.Do keep in mind the fact that these conditions may be modified unilaterally by the website. Therefore, it is always recommended that you carry out your due diligence, and carefully research the affiliate marketing conditions associated with each of the examples given above.Additionally, note that this list isn’t exhaustive – in fact, there are hundreds of crypto-related affiliate opportunities on the market at this moment.It certainly isn’t unusual for affiliate marketing to become a main income stream, especially if done right. People have reported earning hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly using affiliate marketing strategies.Given the fact that we are referring to the digital currency market, your income potential is further increased by crypto price volatility.However, this entails that you treat it as a fulltime job until enough of your links are published on the web.Other Free Crypto OffersA quick search will likely unveil numerous other free cryptocurrency sources. Here are a few examples that we consider relevant:Crypto.comThis crypto debit card company has launched a cash-back system that allows users to earn tokens on each purchase you make. Values vary between 1% and 5%, yet users can also expect several offers on third-party platforms such as Netflix, Spotify, Expedia or Airbnb;Celsius NetworkThis lending platform allows users to deposit cryptocurrency, and earn an interest as other users borrow it. It advertises itself as a safe method of earning passive income by using your existing coins;WirexYet another digital currency card company, Wirex advertises a 0.5% bitcoin-based cashback scheme on all purchases made via the card.Cryptocurrency gamblingCryptocurrency gambling can also act as a method for earning free coins, yet extra care should be practiced if you decide to wager your coins. Do keep in mind that most casinos offer crypto faucets, which give out an amount of free coin every time they are clicked on (they are programmed against abuse, however, and serve as a method of encouraging users to keep on playing).If you do decide to try your luck at a casino, make sure that you choose a platform that relies on a provably-fair protocol. Otherwise, you may expose yourself to rigged games that are bound to steal your hard-earned crypto.Keep an Eye Out for ScamsOver the last couple of years, the popularity of the cryptocurrency market has increased exponentially. The rise in public awareness was mostly fuelled by intense volatility, and record-breaking prices.With this in mind, the market is still seen as a way to get rich quickly. While there is significant money-making potential in crypto, this perception has led to the appearance of numerous scams, meant to fraud people out of their money.Whenever dealing in crypto, there are two aspects worth keeping in mind: if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Also, you should never risk more than you can afford to lose.Cybersecurity practices dictate that it’s best to always carry out in-depth research on any platform or service that you decide to use. Similarly, you should never give out your personal details or private keys to third parties.Protection against scams and other forms of fraudulent activity is basically non-existent, whereas transactions are irreversible, therefore due diligence is essential.The Bottom LineBased on everything that has been highlighted in this guide, most people are only a few clicks away from earning free cryptocurrency.There are hundreds, if not thousands of offers that you can take advantage of, while most imply an insignificant amount of work. On the other hand, those who are serious about creating a crypto-based income stream will be happy to know that affiliate marketing and bug bounty hunting are highly-lucrative passive income streams.    7,119"

41,Blockonomi,Bitcoin Hosting: Web Hosting Companies Who Accept Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency,Oliver Dale,1591080110.0,"It is easy to forget that Bitcoin is a very useful currency in its own right. One area where Bitcoin is a perfect payment solution is web hosting. There are no shortage of top-tier web hosting companies who accept Bitcoin. Most offer a range of services, and some even offer a high level of anonymity.If you got into Bitcoin early, there is a good chance that you are set for life when it comes to web hosting. Although some merchants have stopped accepting Bitcoin after the bear market took hold last year, the world of web hosting is rife with companies that will work with cryptos.Most of the companies on this list have been accepting cryptos for at least a year, and some of them have been crypto-friendly for many years. You shouldn’t worry about finding a webhosting company that accepts cryptos, but it is important to make sure you get the right webhosting plan for your needs.Top Bitcoin Hosting CompaniesContents1 Top Bitcoin Hosting Companies2 Why Choose Webhosting Companies who Accept Bitcoin?3 Buy Webhosting with Cryptocurrency4 What Kind of Webhosting Do You Need?4.1 Shared Hosting4.2 Dedicated Server Hosting4.3 Virtual Private Server (VPS) Webhosting4.4 Cloud Hosting5 Webhosting Companies who Accept Bitcoin6 Hostwinds7 Hostinger8 Namecheap9 Heficed10 Hosterbox11 Hawk Host12 Glowhost13 JAVAPIPE14 Anonymous Web Hosting Options That Accept Bitcoin15 Bitcoin Web Hosting16 Shinjiru17 Orange Website (Private, not Anonymous)18 Iceland’s Dedication to a Free and Open Web19 There are Many Webhosting Companies who Accept BitcoinFurther down we will give you a complete overview of all the bitcoin hosting companies, if you are in hurry though, here are our top two picks.HostwindsHostingerHosting Types Shared VPS Cloud DedicatedHosting Types Shared Cloud VPSPrice From $3.29 MonthPrice From $7.99 MonthAccepted Cryptocurrencies BTC, LTC, BCH, DASH, ETH + More.Accepted Cryptocurrencies BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC.VisitVisitWhy Choose Webhosting Companies who Accept Bitcoin?One of the most obvious reasons to choose Bitcoin as a payment method is its ease of use. If you already have some cryptos, using them as a means of payment is very convenient. There are also options out there for people that want to maximize their anonymity and freedom of speech.Keeping your identity safe online has noting to do with criminality. The world’s political structure is becoming increasingly strained, and many governments are actively censoring ideas. Anonymous webhosting makes sure your site stays online, and you don’t get caught up in a political witch hunt that could cost you your freedom.Unlike some payment systems that apply big charges when you use them, Bitcoin lets you pay minimal transaction fees. No matter where your counterparty is, there is no need to do any kind of currency conversion. Easy payments are another big benefit that cryptos bring to the table.Buy Webhosting with CryptocurrencyBitcoin can be used to buy just about any kind of webhosting there is. Small sites that don’t get much traffic would probably be fine on a cloud or shared server, but some of the webhosting providers we list below offer a lot more than that.It is a good idea to think about what kind of webhosting you need, before you look into a yearly plan. Buying more than you need can add up quickly. There is no benefit to buying a lot of webhosting power when your needs are simple. Save the money if you can.Conversely, if your website is starting to get a lot more traffic, don’t want too long to upgrade your webhosting. Nothing turns users off faster than a website that is slow to load, or buggy. Making sure that your customers can browse easily is a big part of building up an e-commerce website, and the right amount of server power is an important part of that equation.What Kind of Webhosting Do You Need?There are a different kinds of webhosting to choose from. Some webhosting companies will offer just about any kind there is, while others have a more specific mix of webhosting options. Here is a brief rundown of some of the most popular forms of webhosting.Some of these webhosting options might seem a little bit redundant, and they are. Today, cloud hosting is creating new ways to do webhosting. More webhosting options are basically a good thing, but it is important to understand the highlights and drawbacks of each option.If you are already a webhosting expert, just skip this section!Shared HostingIf you are just getting into the online game, shared hosting is probably the way to go. All of your data will be stored on a server with other websites. Shared hosting is a cost effective option because the webhosting company can put tens or hundreds (or more) websites on single server, some providers offer managed hosting which means they will manage all aspects of your website for you;Shared hosting is potentially slower than dedicated hosting, but smaller websites probably won’t notice much of a differences (geographic location means a lot too). All of the domains will share the server’s resources, including RAM and storage.The major upside to shared hosting is the cost.Most webhosting companies will offer shared hosting for a few dollars a month, which more than offsets the potential downsides for non-enterprise clients. The downside of limited server power isn’t going to be an issue for smaller websites, though it would be a problem for larger businesses.Dedicated Server HostingDedicated server hosting is basically the opposite of shared hosting.Your webhosting company will give you access to a server that is just for your website. The advantages of a dedicated server are substantial. Instead of sharing server resources with who knows how many other websites, you get all the RAM, memory and bandwidth.On the flipside, dedicated servers are much more expensive.Unless you have an established web presence, and are making money from your online business, using a dedicated server probably isn’t necessary. The costs to run an dedicated server will add up quickly, so make sure you need one before you sign a long-term contract.Virtual Private Server (VPS) WebhostingA VPS mimics some of the aspects of a dedicated server, while still using a server that is shared with more than one website. If you need to use custom software, or want the kind of control that only a dedicated server can deliver, a VPS is a step up from shared hosting.Unfortunately, a VPS will still still suffer from some of the issues that are inherent to shared hosting. If a traffic spike hits, your website will slow down. On the plus side, a VPS is going to be far cheaper than a real dedicated server.Using a VPS is a good way to troubleshoot your web architecture before migrating to a real dedicated server, as most VPSs operate as a dedicated server would.Cloud HostingThe term ‘cloud hosting’ has become something of a buzzword in the world of webhosting. At its most basic level, cloud hosting just means that your website will be hosted in the ‘cloud’, which is a wide network of interconnected computers.If you are considering cloud hosting, be sure to read about what your would actually be getting from the webhosting company. In most cases shared hosting is going to be cheaper, and with few disadvantages to smaller websites.Medium and enterprise-level websites have more research to do. If your company has traffic from all over the world, cloud hosting could be a good option.All of the webhosting companies we chose for this list have good (or even great) reputations for customer service, so you should be able to ask them about what kind of hosting plan would fit your needs the best.Webhosting Companies who Accept BitcoinHere is our run down of all the hosting companies which allow you to pay in crypto or bitcoin, will be updated as we find any more.HostwindsHostwinds has been in business since 2010.

The world of webhosting is subject to numerous political and legal issues. If you want to make sure that your website won’t get nailed for political reasons, or want to keep your ownership hidden, there are webhosting options out there for you.The world of geopolitics is getting more complex all the time. There are some areas of the world where certain ideas will get you in legal trouble. While the internet is basically open to anything, the authorities in a nation that is offended by what you post may come after you using local laws.Needless to say, that is an outcome you want to avoid.These issues are even more important for a website that publishes controversial content on a regular basis. If you are working with ideas that powerful people aren’t going to be happy about, it might be a good idea to protect your identity to the greatest degree possible.Thankfully, Bitcoin offers a high degree of anonymity. There are webhosting companies who will help you maintain your privacy, and accept Bitcoin as well.Bitcoin Web HostingBitcoin Web Hosting does what that name says.

42,Blockonomi,How to Make Money with Bitcoin: 10 Ways to Earn Cryptocurrency,Andrew Norry,1591078161.0,"There are a number of ways that individuals can earn Bitcoin online. Unfortunately, just as in real life, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Any way of earning Bitcoin online will require something in exchange, whether it’s your time or your knowledge or your computer’s processing power.Some of the methods outlined below will involve minimal effort but will also result in minimal returns. Other means of earning Bitcoin online may be more lucrative but they will require you to have a certain level of knowledge and expertise about the industry and the market.Therefore, although it may appear to some that Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, is an easy way to make money, it is not as easy as some might expect without the requisite knowledge (a principle that can unsurprisingly be applied to any industry).However, should you be interested in earning Bitcoin online it may be worth considering some of the below options, ranging from the least difficult (and least paid!) to the more substantial roles available in the Bitcoin ecosystem.Coinbase EarnContents1 Coinbase Earn2 Bitcoin Lending3 Micro Earnings4 Paid-to-Click Websites5 Bitcoin Faucets6 Micro Jobs7 Writing about Bitcoin8 BitcoinTalk Signature Campaigns9 Writing for blog and news sites10 Affiliate Marketing11 Provide Bitcoin-related services12 Bitcoin Mining13 Bitcoin Trading14 Day Trading15 Trading Bots16 3Commas17 Cryptohopper18 CryptoTrader19 Contracts for Difference20 Binary Options21 ConclusionProbably the easiest way right now to earn some free cryptocurrency is to take advantage of Coinbase Earn. As you will probably know, Coinbase is one of the largest and easiest ways to purchase Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.Last year they launched a new initiative called Coinbase Earn, this is a program where you can earn a variety of different cryptos by watching some educational videos about each crypto and then answering some multiple choice questions.The coins on offer change, so it’s best to register and participate in any that are available and keep an eye out for their emails as they add new ones from time to time.This is an easy way to earn a couple of hundred dollars of cryptocurrency which you can then withdraw or sell for fiat on the platform.Signup for Coinbase EarnBitcoin LendingThere are potentially significant earnings to be made in Bitcoin lending, but there is also significant risk. Bitcoin lending tends to operate through intermediary websites such as Blockfi and Nexo and the concept is as simple as it sounds.Read our full review of BlockFi here. BlockFi: CryptoloansYou act as a bank, lending your Bitcoin to another person at a certain level of interest. Because the market is unregulated the levels of interest are generally much higher than the standard bank rate meaning that there is a potential for high returns.However, on the flip-side, the unregulated nature of the transaction means that in the event that the borrower does not pay back the Bitcoin to you, there is little recourse available for you to enforce the loan.The volatility and the risk associated with the Bitcoin lending market means that it is probably a market only accessible to very large holders of Bitcoin, due to the level of risk and the potential expense in enforcing a loan if something goes wrong. However, if handled correctly, there is huge potential market in this sector.Read our Nexo review here.For more information about Bitcoin Lending, take a look at our indepth guide.Micro EarningsAlthough micro-earnings is the easiest method in which to earn Bitcoin, it is also probably the most time consuming of all the methods discussed, especially when taking into consideration the amount of money to be made.Micro earning websites pay you in Bitcoin for completing small tasks. In return you can get a (very) small amount of Bitcoin. The most popular forms of micro earnings are as follows:Paid-to-Click WebsitesAs suggested by the name, these websites pay users in Bitcoin for visiting certain websites or viewing certain advertisements. There are many PTC websites that will pay negligible amounts in Bitcoin for clicks and views, with Ads4BTC probably being the most famous and the most popular.This website allows users to choose between viewing ads that are 5 seconds, 10 seconds or 20 seconds, with different fees being awarded for each.Based on the prices offered by Ads4BTC, if you had 20 second ads running for an entire day, you would make less than $10 per day, so this may not be a viable option for most.Bitcoin FaucetsA Bitcoin faucet is a type of website that gives away small amounts of Bitcoin to its users, with owners making money by placing ads on their website and pay individuals who visit the ads or complete surveys.This industry amounts of over 50% of the traffic on leading Bitcoin websites today. Faucets let visitors earn a percentage of the Bitcoin that they give away to any visitors that you brought in.This has resulted in users using a Bitcoin faucet rotator that allows users to quickly surf different faucets and earn a commission through rotation links for each faucet visited by you.However, similar to PTC websites, Bitcoin faucets are not a realistic way to earn good money, with even the best faucet rotators being applied still only enabling users to make no more than $1-2 per day.Micro JobsMicro jobs are small tasks that can be completed for small amounts of Bitcoin. Websites such as Coinworker offer such tasks, which may involve simply testing a plugin to see if it is successfully compatible with a browser, or just retweeting a post.Again, the money is small but there is potential to earn a little bit more than the faucets of PTC websites.Writing about BitcoinIf you’re knowledgeable about Bitcoin, enthusiastic about the cryptocurrency industry in general and willing and able to share your knowledge, then you can also earn Bitcoin by doing so.The amount that can be earned by writing about Bitcoin varies, but can be quite lucrative depending on the level of expertise that you have on the subject.BitcoinTalk Signature CampaignsThe BitcoinTalk Forum Signature campaign pays for users to write posts on the BitcoinTalk forum which includes a product campaign in the signature. Payment levels depend on your membership level on the BitcoinTalk forum, with very little Bitcoin being available for users that aren’t a full member of the forum (to obtain full membership, you need at least 120 posts).Most campaigns also have certain requirements for posters, such as a minimum word limit or a requirement that no advertisements are directly included in posts. In addition, some campaigns may include a minimum and/or a maximum weekly post count.The amount of money that can be made from these campaigns varies depending on the number of quality posts that you could make as a user that achieve the word count minimums.Depending on the campaign you may be able to make $50-100 for 24 hours of work, exclusive of the posts needed to obtain full membership to the forum.In addition, due to some campaigns operating only allowing for a maximum number of posts per week, there may not be sufficient income within a campaign to earn substantial amounts.Lots of new Cryptocurrency companies also offer “Bounties” for performing other tasks, such as creating YouTube videos, blogging and posting on social media.You will earn differing amounts depending on how many followers you have so it can be useful to build your Facebook or Twitter accounts and participate in different campaigns.You will typically be paid after the ICO has taken place and receive some of the coin or token from the company you helped promote.Writing for blog and news sitesIt is at this point that the potential for making good money begins to rise, although the corresponding requirements for knowledge about Bitcoin also increase at the same time.There are an ever-increasing number of blogs and news sites that require dedicated writers to discuss Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and, depending on your level of understanding about your subject, there are a virtual limitless number of options available to writers, with good quality writers being paid between $30-100 per 1,000 words.At this level writers can also choose their payment methods, whether it be in Bitcoin or in fiat currency. Websites such as Coinality is a good place to start if you are looking to find jobs writing about Bitcoin online.Affiliate MarketingIf you take the writing route for Bitcoin and your blog or website is a success, there is potential to make money through Bitcoin affiliate marketing. This is a form of marketing where you can get paid a certain percentage of commission for every referral that you bring to an existing Bitcoin business.If the business operates an affiliate programme, and your blog is read by enough people who link to the business and purchase the product offered, then the commissions can potentially be unlimited, for minimal outlay other than the drafting of the original blog post.Provide Bitcoin-related servicesWhen it comes to cryptocurrency, if your level of expertise is more on the technical side rather than the writing side, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in cryptocurrency development projects.Most of the companies currently operating in the cryptocurrency industry are start-ups with limited infrastructure in place. Therefore, they often need everything from software developers to web developers to mining experts to online marketers.Depending on the size of the startup a role such as this can vary from being a contracting job that can be completed remotely, or alternatively could be a full-time job.The amount that can be earned from a role such as this is obviously dependent on the type of role, the level of expertise that you bring to the role and the number of hours that you will be dedicating to the role.Bitcoin MiningEarly adherents to the Bitcoin industry have made significant fees through mining Bitcoin. Mining Bitcoin is the process by which new coins are created.Mining is carried out using certain computer programmes and utilises the processing power of the miner’s computer.At its inception, Bitcoin mining was relatively simple and the earliest miners were able to mine thousands and thousands of Bitcoin with limited expenditure.However, at the same time, the value of Bitcoin was nowhere near where it was today and therefore any large profits being made from mining didn’t really begin to happen until a number of years after when the value of Bitcoin began to rise.Nowadays, Bitcoin mining is much harder. Each Bitcoin that is mined requires more processing power and therefore mining Bitcoin now involves significant processing power and can no longer be done without specialized equipment.In addition, the costs of the electricity used to power this equipment is phenomenal, with Bitcoin mining currently estimating to be using the same power per day as a country the size of Morocco.Because of this, most Bitcoin mining has been taken over by companies who can make profit by scale based on buying large amounts of processing hardware at a discount as well as locating themselves in an area with extremely cheap electricity.For this reason, China is by far the largest Bitcoin mining country (mining over 60% of Bitcoin), followed by Georgia, Sweden and the US.Bitcoin TradingThere is huge potential to make money on trading in Bitcoin, but it takes a level of expertise and knowledge about the market in the same way that trading on any other financial market does.In addition, the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile and therefore may not suit everybody’s tastes and risk appetite. The first issue with trading is that almost all of the trading exchanges operate through Bitcoin or Ethereum, meaning that if you wish to trade in cryptocurrency and don’t own any, you will probably need to own some (with some exceptions).Websites such as Coinbase or CEX both allow users to purchase cryptocurrency by credit or debit card, or alternatively to purchase via a bank transfer. Once purchased, you can then transfer your Bitcoin to whichever exchange you wish to operate on. If you wish to consider trading, here are some of the options:Day TradingDay trading is buying and selling Bitcoins on the same day on the basis of small, short-term price fluctuations in the market. Such fluctuations may be based on market trends or simply rumours. Traders can trade Bitcoin against other cryptocurrencies or against fiat currencies such as the US Dollar.Trading BotsRunning your own Bitcoin Trading bot is an advanced method which can produce good returns if done properly.We have written a complete guide to trading bots here which will show you the methods and advantages to earning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies this way. Here are some of the more popular platforms and bots to use:3Commas3Commas is a very popular trading bot which works with a number of exchanges including Bittrex, BitFinex, Binance, Bitstamp, KuCoin, Poloniex, GDAX, Cryptopia, Huobi and YOBIT.The bot works 24 / / 7 with any device as it is a web-based service so you can monitor your trading dashboard on mobile as well as desktop and laptop computers.It allows you to set stop-loss and take-profit targets and also has a social trading aspect which allows you to copy the actions of it’s most successful traders.For more information about 3Commas, check out our complete review here.Visit 3CommasCryptohopperCryptohopper is a cloud-based trading bot which means it can trade cryptocurrency 24 hours a day whether you are at your computer or not.

Instead, you buy a contract for Bitcoin, meaning that you don’t actually have to hold or store any Bitcoin.One of the advantages of this is that you can short Bitcoin, meaning that if the price goes down, your profit goes up, allowing you to hedge your trades. Read: Best Forex BrokersOne of the disadvantages is that you have no control over the Bitcoin you trade with, as you are not the owner of any Bitcoin or the controller of the private key. It can therefore only be used for trading purposes.More about CFDs here.Binary OptionsBinary options (so-called because the only option is to win or to lose) is a trade strategy that allows you to predict if the price of Bitcoin will rise or fall in a certain period of time.If the rise or fall occurs within the set period, you will receive the payout agreed upon when entering into the option. If it does not occur, then you lose your investment.We recently reviewed IQ Option which is the largest site for trading Binary options.ConclusionAlthough not exhaustive, these are some of the most popular ways in which you can earn income online. As noted at the outset, there is no such thing as free Bitcoin and something will have to be given in return, whether it’s time or expertise or both.However, with an ever-expanding market the demand for Bitcoin expertise and Bitcoin related products means that there has never been a better time to get involved in Bitcoin.    267,719"
43,Blockonomi,Prime XBT Review: Cryptocurrency Trading Exchange With 100x Leverage,Oliver Dale,1590984859.0,"Prime XBT is newer trading platform launched in 2019 that lets traders take advantage of the ability to trade Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies with leverage.They have quickly become one of the major players in the margin-trading industry taking on heavyweights such as BitMex.The exchange aims to overcome the common problems of other platforms, including long KYC approval processes, unexpected downtime, low liquidity, problems trading on markets that are failing, limited order types, poor user experience, and high trading fees.Instead, PrimeXBT offers amazing leverage, a highly user-friendly interface, vast liquidity and trading volumes. Read on for our full review.Visit PrimeXBTPrime XBT Leverage Contents1 Prime XBT Leverage 2 Profiting From Market Movements3 Prime XBT Trading4 PrimeXBT Trading Platform5 Trading Charts on PrimeXBT6 PrimeXBT Fees & Limits7 Conclusion8 PrimeXBT8.1 Ease of Use8.2 Reputation8.3 Fees8.4 Customer Support8.5 Payment Methods9 Pros 10 Cons Leverage is one of the many features that advanced traders tend to look for, but most platforms offer very limited leverage when it comes to trading cryptocurrency. PrimeXBT stands out by offering leverage of 1:100.This means that for each $1, you get $100 worth of buying or selling power. This essentially gives you access to a greater market position, so you can make even more profits, or indeed losses.Leverage is one of the key features of PrimeXBT and among its main features. The website also offers a detailed explanation of leverage on its website to help those that do not fully understand.This explanation includes an example with BTC/USD for example.In this example, assume that Bitcoin is $10,000 each, and its price rose by 5 percent during your investment.If you were to use a traditional exchange without leverage, you could buy 10 BTC for $100,000 (10 x $10,000).If the price went up by 5 percent, your BTC would be worth $10,500 each so if you sell them, you will make $5,000 off of your $100,000 investment.In contrast, if you were to make the same trade on PrimeXBT with its 1:100 leverage, you would only have to pay 1 percent of the $100,000 position, meaning an investment of $1,000 up front.In the same situation, this means you would still make $5,000 but would have only invested $1,000. In other words, you can vastly multiply your profits with the same amount of initial capital.PrimeXBT explains some of the advantages of trading with leverage, including the ability to magnify profits, gearing opportunities (the ability to free up capital you can use for another investment), and the ability to gain when the market falls.There is also a convenient leverage calculator on PrimeXBT, so you can figure out your buying power based on your available capital.Just keep in mind that while using leverage increases the potential reach of your funds and your potential profits, it will also increase the potential losses.As such, you should always be cautious when using the maximum leverage offered on PrimeXBT. That being said, those with trading experience and confidence in their methods find leverage to be an incredibly useful tool.Profiting From Market MovementsSince the cryptocurrency market does not always increase, PrimeXBT offers methods of profiting whether the market is going up or down. You can trade any of the most popular cryptocurrencies and hedge existing holdings or profit from rallies or declines in the market.In other words, you can go either long or short with PrimeXBT. Buying is when you go long while selling is when you go short. To go long, you would buy Bitcoin and watch your account increase in value while the price of BTC rises.In this case, a fall in BTC’s price would drop the value in your account. In contrast, you can go short, which means you open a position that will increase its value if the price of BTC goes down.You can view specific examples with calculations for each of these types of trades on PrimeXBT. There is also information on calculating your profits, so you can understand what is going on in your account. To calculate your profit or loss, you just take the difference in price points at opening vs. closing and multiply this value by the size of the position. If you combine it with leverage, you can increase your position size.Prime XBT TradingIn addition to the ability to go long or short and to enjoy leverage of up to 1:100, PrimeXBT stands out in multiple ways. It has a very user-friendly interface that fully customizable and includes support for multiple monitors.The trading platform is a best-in-class option as it is safe, reliable, and fast. It is simple enough for beginners to understand yet includes the advanced tools that professional traders want.The charting tools are particularly useful with various chart types, a range of drawing tools and indicators, and the option of trading right from the chart. PrimeXBT also offers very low trading fees. You will notice straightforward and low commission rates, so there are no surprises. Additionally, PrimeXBT offers tight spreads.PrimeXBT Trading PlatformYou can preview the live trading platform of PrimeXBT to get a feel for how it works before you open an account. The preview version of the platform is incredibly similar to the real version.The only difference is in the very bottom section of the screen labeled “Positions.” If you have a live account, you would see a list of positions with the following columns for each: symbol, position ID, time and date, side, size, fill price, current price, take profit, stop loss, and P/L.Since the preview version is not associated with an account, this section is blurred out and over it, you will find the option to log in or register.Overall, the trading platform is exactly what you expect as it is very similar to the trading pages experienced investors are used to. On the top left side of the screen, you will see a list of cryptocurrency pairs.These include LTC/USD, BTC/USD, ETH/USD, EOS/USD, and XRP/USD. For each, you can view the bid price, ask price, and change. These figures are color-coded in white, green, or red.As expected, green indicates an increase while red indications a decrease.Clicking on any of the pairs listed here will bring you to a screen that lets you buy or sell the crypto in question. It will display the prices for buying and selling as well as the low and high for the pair.Below this section, still on the left of the screen, you will see the Order Book. The Order Book displays the information for whichever currency pair you most recently selected from the top left corner. It is divided into sales and purchases. A nice touch on this Order Book is that in addition to a list of the quantities and prices, it also displays a visual representation via graphs in green and red in the background. This way, you can see the current trends at a glance.The main section of the trading page is the actual chart, which is directly to the right of the crypto listings and Order Book and takes up most of the page. The top left corner of the chart shows you the trading pair it represents.You can adjust this by clicking on the box where it is listed and typing in the new pair (you will notice autofill suggestions) or by clicking on the pair to the left in the crypto listing section.Trading Charts on PrimeXBTThe default setting of the PrimeXBT trading chart is a candlestick chart. It is color-coded green and red with prices on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. Hovering over any point on the chart will show you the specific date and time as well as the open, high, low, close, and value.You can increase or decrease the time range displayed by adjusting the time graph immediately below the main chart. The top of the chart is where you will find most settings.There is a drop-down menu that lets you change the intervals of the candlesticks. The default is 5 minutes, but you can also choose 1, 15, or 30 minutes; 1, 2, or 4 hours; or 1 day, week, or month. To the left of this is the option to switch from a candlestick chart to a line graph or bar graph.Next to this, you will find options regarding crosshairs. You can also choose long or short and from a range of 13 indicators, lines, and tools to add. These include things like a trend line, trend channel, and Fibonacci Rays, among others.Advanced traders will be interested in the Studies section, which is accessible via an icon of a test tube to the right of the above options and to the left of Studies. You can choose from one of several dozen available studies or add in your own study. Use up to five at once.There are two methods of trading with PrimeXBT. You can click on a pair on the left of the page and fill in the box that appears. Or you can use the section at the top left corner of the chart, directly below the name of the pair.PrimeXBT Fees & LimitsPrimeXBT charges two types of fees, trading and overnight finance. Because instruments are leveraged products you finance the traded value through an overnight financing.This borrowing cost (financing) is dependent on the liquidity of the underlying asset. If you open and close a leveraged position within the same trading day, you are not subject to overnight financing.SymbolTrading feeFinancing/day LongFinancing/day ShortBTC/USD0.05%-$3.9 per 1 BTC-$3.9 per 1 BTCETH/USD0.05%-$0.13 per 1 ETH-$0.13 per 1 ETHLTC/USD0.05%-$0.03 per 1 LTC-$0.03 per 1 LTCXRP/USD0.05%-$0.00038 per 1 XRP-$0.00038 per 1 XRPEOS/USD0.05%-$0.0025 per 1 EOS-$0.0025 per 1 EOS The exposure limit is a restriction on the size of a position each individual client can maintain with PrimeXBT.

The exchange officially opened last year and has gone on to cement a good reputation in the industry.As with all types of exchanges that offer leverage, we would advise you to proceed cautiously if you haven’t traded in this manner before. It’s quite easy to get things wrong and end up being liquidated and losing your cryptocurrency in this way, especially if you are employing a high amount of leverage.We have updated this review for 2020 and are now much more confident in recommending them to our readers.Visit PrimeXBT PrimeXBT     8.6 Ease of Use  9.0/10 Reputation  8.0/10 Fees  9.0/10 Customer Support  8.0/10 Payment Methods  9.0/10 Pros Low FeesLeverage AvailableCredit Card Deposits AvailableReferral SystemAnonymous Accounts Cons Newer ExchangeNot RegulatedEmail Support   Visit       15,161"
44,Blockonomi,Beginners Guide to Proton Chain: A Bridge to Traditional Banking,Oliver Dale,1590744277.0,"The choices we make each time we make a purchase are so ingrained, they’ve become unconscious. If we purchase from a merchant online, we hand over our credit card or bank account details. If we pay by check, we often have to provide ID to back up our purchase. It’s a continuous trade-off between identity, privacy, and making the financial expenditure we need.Proton chain exists to overcome these compromises. It’s a secure blockchain protocol that aims to unite fiat and crypto payments ecosystems under a single platform.HistoryContents1 History2 Problems Proton Chain Aims to Solve3 Features of Proton4 Token5 Roadmap6 Team7 ConclusionProton started as a joint venture between two separate companies, Metal, and Lynx. Both companies had a similar vision of bringing cryptocurrencies to everyday consumers; however, each implemented this vision in different ways.Metal developed a blockchain-based payment processing platform, intending to become the crypto equivalent of Venmo or PayPal. It was launched in June 2017 with a $3m ICO and has since opened up its applications on iOS and Android. It now also offers a marketplace with fiat onboarding where users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, Lynx has evolved into a key player within the EOS ecosystem, having built the leading EOS wallet for US users. The company was also one of the earlier pioneers of EOS gaming, having processed millions of dollars worth of transactions through EOSBet. Ultimately, Lynx decided it could improve upon the design and capabilities of EOS and developed its own Lynxchain as a fork of EOS.Early in 2020, the two companies decided to combine the best features of each into Proton chain, creating a bridge between traditional finance, cryptocurrency, and blockchain-based applications.Problems Proton Chain Aims to SolveProton aims to address several issues facing traditional banks and crypto finance. In traditional finance, when the sender authorizes a payment, it’s usually sent over some kind of telecommunication channel, which exposes it to interception by malicious third parties. Furthermore, the prolonged period it takes for merchants and banks to verify transactions only increases this risk.In the crypto space, there are no native compliance tools covering anti-money laundering legislations, with operators left to engage third party providers, which increases overheads and introduces complexity. There is also no way to push or pull funds between a blockchain and legacy finance systems.Features of ProtonProton chain allows a user to move cash into their wallet, where they can then use it to buy or sell any supported cryptocurrency, which can also be used seamlessly in dApps.The protocol operates based on a system of verified user identities to ensure that funds are only allocated where they’re supposed to be.The identify verification part of the Proton chain platform works by using a decentralized network of KYC validators and money service businesses. This network will verify the identity of any user signing up for the platform, assigning them with their own @ name and the status of “trusted user.” The naming protocol is comparable to Twitter, and the trusted user status will appear on any application using the Proton naming protocol.The first use case for Proton chain is Metal Pay. However, in the future, the team envisages that any fiat or crypto payment service such as Venmo or Alipay could sign up to use the service. The platform uses “push signing,” meaning that users authenticate their payments by providing their verified @ username.Furthermore, users can move money between any Proton-enabled account seamlessly and instantly.The Proton network can handle up to 5,000 transactions per second, which is faster than either Ripple or PayPal. Source: Protonchain.comTokenXPR is the native token of the Proton chain. Like EOS, Proton chain works through the delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) consensus, allowing users to stake their tokens as a way of voting for which nodes get to produce blocks.The project has minted an initial supply of 200 million XPR, with 5% annual inflation. The inflationary tokens will be split between block producers (2.5%) stakers (1.5%) and the Proton Steering Committee (1%.)Block producers validate network transactions with a two-third majority consensus required to write to the blockchain. Transactions are considered final after three minutes has elapsed.Staking one token confers one vote to the token holder. Stakers must agree to a minimum one-month staking period, and their tokens are bonded, meaning they will lose out if their delegated block producer doesn’t perform to a minimum standard.The XPR token is available on the Metal X exchange, along with external platforms, including Bithumb and HitBTC. It can be stored on the Lynx Wallet.RoadmapThe Proton chain launched on mainnet at the end of April 2020, and the Metal and Lynx companies officially merged in mid-May.The entire team is now dedicated to the development and launch of Metal Pay 3.0, which will be rolled out over three phases.In the first phase, the Proton Open SDK Initiative will be launched. “Red Falcon” will be the second phase, aimed at making Metal Pay 3.0 the first wallet capable of interacting with the Proton chain using authentication and push signing. This will involve every Metal Pay user having their own unique @ name, stored on the Proton blockchain, and use their @ name to respond to payment push requests.Furthermore, this phase will involve the implementation of a non-custodial “crypto-tab” within the Metal Pay app, allowing the users to send and receive Proton tokens. It will also launch a feature enabling users to “wrap” coins purchased on a third party exchange on the Proton chain.The third phase, called Snow Owl, will add new features to the established Metal Pay 3.0 framework, including multiple fit currencies, a Proton-based stablecoin, and a web client.TeamThe Proton team comprises members from both Metal and Lynx.Marshall Hayner is the co-founder and CEO of Proton. Before founding Metal, he also founded crypto companies, including QuickCoin and Block.io, and was the tenth employee on the Stellar launch team.Fred Kreuger is the co-founder and President, and former founder and CEO of EOS Lynx. Educated at Cornell and Stanford, he’s also the inventor of the “Currency Index Swap” and has over $500m in exits.Glenn Mariën is co-founder and CSO with over ten years in full-stack development experience. He created Dogecoin.info, the first online wallet for Dogecoin, which was later acquired by Block.io under Marshall Hayner.Early investors in the project include Erik Voorhees, founder and CEO of Shapeshift, and Brian Kelly of CNBC Fast Money, who also runs the BKCM LLC investment firm.ConclusionCryptocurrencies do have a severe UX problem, with too much friction between the digital asset and fiat worlds. Proton’s vision is to overcome this, while at the same time creating a more secure environment for authorizing and spending fiat currencies using traditional payment providers.It’s an ambitious goal. However, if the project team can pull it off, it would represent the first time that any project has been able to create an effective bridge between fiat and crypto, but also bring blockchain’s security benefits to traditional payment processors.A critical enabler of the project’s success would be to onboard a couple of established payment providers. Therefore, a credible demonstration of the capabilities of Metal Pay 3.0 powered by Proton chain will be a big step towards making this happen.    2,981"
45,Blockonomi,Mapping the Rise of Bitcoin on Ethereum: Considerations & Top Projects,William M. Peaster,1590493405.0,"Last week, I wrote on whether the advance of ERC20 bitcoin token projects was good for both Bitcoin and Ethereum or mainly just Ethereum. That’s an open question for now.What’s clear, though, is that Ethereum’s rising tokenized bitcoin sector is already joining the ranks of stablecoins, DeFi, DAOs, and NFTs as the top smart contract platform’s earliest and brightest stars.Major growth ahead seems all but certain because there’s major growth happening in the here and now: in recent months, the amount of activity around tokenized bitcoin efforts has been exploding. As such, new implications and new projects have been coming to the fore in the cryptoeconomy.Ethereum: Bitcoin’s Top Scaling Solution to Date?Contents1 Ethereum: Bitcoin’s Top Scaling Solution to Date?2 Bringing BTC to DeFi3 Understanding the Variety4 WBTC5 tBTC6 sBTC7 renBTC8 BTC++9 Watch This SpaceThe Lightning Network is a layer-two scaling protocol that’s been proposed as the leading scaling solution for Bitcoin. The system helps take BTC transactions off-chain as a means of decreasing congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain proper.The advantage of Lightning, then, is that it can work directly with bitcoin. However, after several years of development, the system still has non-trivial UX drawbacks. The system’s not down and out, far from it, but more than a few folks think it should be further along than it is right now.On the flip side, Ethereum’s scaling scene is starting to heat up. The recent advance of layer-two Optimistic Rollup (ORU) solutions is a major step toward scaling Ethereum 1.0. And in a matter of weeks, the first phase of Ethereum 2.0 kicks off. This will put Ethereum on a direct path to sharding, a powerful scaling technique, in the years ahead.With all that said, Ethereum as it stands can already power faster and cheaper transactions than Bitcoin. With the rise of ERC20 bitcoin tokens on Ethereum, then, the reigning smart contract platform has already become something of a de facto scaling solution for BTC.This dynamic is only set to increase as Ethereum continues to mature along its development roadmap and things like ORUs really start to proliferate. This will all make BTC even easier to spend and use, which is why tokenized bitcoin is so interesting in the first place.Bringing BTC to DeFiBeyond making bitcoin easier to use, tokenized BTC can also be used in many different productive ways within Ethereum’s growing decentralized finance, or DeFi, ecosystem.For example, last week the cryptoeconomy celebrated Bitcoin Pizza Day in honor of when developer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC back in 2010. Of course, Hanyecz made the buy expressly to help kick off the bitcoin market, but the move has also gone down in infamy since sum of BTC would be worth nearly $100 million USD today.If something like leading DeFi lending platform MakerDAO existed at the time, Hanyecz could have collateralized ERC20 bitcoin to draw out an automated loan denominated in Maker’s dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin. That way, the developer could have paid for pizza with Dai in order to retain 100% exposure to potential future upside in the bitcoin price.That’s just one example, but all these years later many bitcoiners think the BTC price still has major upside ahead, and presumably some of these folks wouldn’t mind being able to spend against their bitcoin holdings without missing out on any long-term BTC price gains. That’s what DeFi platforms like MakerDAO and Compound can do for users now.Other opportunities abound for tokenized bitcoin users in DeFi, like earning as a liquidity provider on Uniswap or on other decentralized exchanges.Understanding the VarietyERC20 bitcoin tokens are starting to kick off left and right, and more are undoubtedly coming since the sector is still fledgling. The efforts we’ve seen so far have come in  different shapes and sizes.The most important consideration here is thinking of ERC20 bitcoins as existing at different places along the spectrum of trust.Some projects, like WBTC, rely on third parties and are thus more centralized. On the flip side, other projects like tBTC are meant to be trustless in practice. Lets quickly review some of the top contenders from both sides of this spectrum.WBTCWBTC for “Wrapped Bitcoin” is a tokenized bitcoin in which the project’s underlying bitcoin reserves are custodied by leading cryptocurrency custodian firm BitGo.WBTC’s been out in the wild for a while now, so anyone can pick some up on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap rather than having to mint their own. However, there have been some really large WBTC mints in recent days, some of which have gone straight into Maker Vaults.Indeed, the MakerDAO community voted in WBTC as an approved collateral type for Dai loans earlier this month. Things have moved fast since then, too. With the exception of ether (ETH), there’s now more Dai backed by WBTC than any other cryptocurrency (other support Dai collateral types currently include USDC and Basic Attention Token).tBTCtBTC has been built by the Keep Network team as a trustless tokenized bitcoin project. This means users can mint their own tBTC without having to go through a centralized third-party like a crypto custodian.tBTC hit the Ethereum mainnet earlier this month and was only live for a few days before a bug was discovered in the token’s redemption process. Keep deployed an emergency pause and has since charted out a fix and a return for tBTC.The episode fortunately came early enough in the project’s lifespan that it can still completely actualize from here. I wouldn’t sleep on the talent behind the project, to be sure.sBTCsBTC is a synthetic version of bitcoin created by decentralized synthetic assets platform Synthetix.This particular ERC20 bitcoin is underpinned by Snythetix’s native SNX token, which is used as collateral for the issuance of synthetic assets through Synthetix. In this sense, sBTC isn’t directly backed by bitcoin reserves but exists as a synth supported by Synthetix’s system.Notably, Synthetix is presently one of the top 3 DeFi projects atop Ethereum, so sBTC is certainly another major tokenized bitcoin offering worth tracking.renBTCrenBTC is a tokenized bitcoin effort from the Ren project, the team building out the RenVM.In short, the RenVM can be used to trustlessly mint assets like bitcoin as ERC-20 tokens on a 1:1 basis on Ethereum. renBTC is an early demonstration of what the RenVM can do, then, and it’s also set to be redeemable at any time. Like tBTC, this one can get much bigger going forward due to its decentralized structure.BTC++BTC++ is a tokenized bitcoin offering from the new PieDAO group that tracks multiple ERC20 bitcoin tokens for the sake of mitigating risk.To that end, the BTC++ portfolio is currently weighted as follows: 25% in WBTC, 25% in sBTC, 25% in the Provable project’s pBTC, and 25% in Tokelon’s imBTC. Accordingly, it’s a design the tokenized bitcoin sector hasn’t seen yet and one that’s likely to be emulated by other projects in the future.Watch This SpaceERC20 bitcoins seem poised to become much more popular in the years ahead. If that happens, the projects mentioned above could prove to be some of the biggest early winners in the ecosystem.The big related questions will persist for now, too, like whether Ethereum is Bitcoin’s most promising scaling tech or whether ERC20 bitcoin is mutualistic or mostly just good for Ethereum.

47,Blockonomi,The Best Torrent Sites: Complete Guide to The Most Popular Sites,Oliver Dale,1590218259.0,"Torrents are files containing metadata, which is a data set containing information on other data. Therefore, a torrent does contain the content file. Instead, it helps torrent software search for “peers” or “seeds” that share the data. The program then extracts data from those shared files, producing a finished version of the data.Think of it as using the torrent software to collect whatever movies, TV shows, music, or other content files you want from other people’s computers all around the world. That doesn’t mean that you need to give up your drive and all your information when you download a torrent, either.The program collects pieces of data from shared files and puts them together on your computer or device. No-one has access to your information at any stage. The speed of the data transfer depends on the number of peers hosting the content for transfer. The seeds or peers, the faster the data transfer.How Does a Torrent Work?Contents1 How Does a Torrent Work?1.1 Disclaimer2 The Top 25 Torrent Sites2.1 At a Glance2.2 The Pirate Bay2.3 YTS2.4 Rutracker2.5 Eztv2.6 Rarbg2.7 Torrentz22.8 KickAssTorrents2.9 Torrent92.10 LimeTorrents2.11 Zooqle2.12 Magnetdl2.13 Torlock2.14 Arenabg2.15 PCgamestorrents2.16 ettv.tv2.17 Torrentgalaxy2.18 Torrentfunk2.19 seedpeer2.20 idope2.21 monova2.22 yourbittorrent2.23 btdig2.24 torrentdownloads.me2.25 Nyaa.si2.26 1337x.to3 What are the Advantages of Downloading Torrent?4 Are There Any Disadvantages in Downloading Torrent Files?5 Do I Need a VPN to Download Torrents?5.1 Which VPN to use?6 How Does a VPN Work?7 How do I Download a Torrent?8 What are the Types of Torrent Sites?When you browse online, the browser sends multiple requests to servers every second to download information related to your browsing session. If the server can’t handle the request load from users on its network, it ends up crashing.When browsing, the browser in use sends multiple requests to a server so that it can download the information.However, this server can have too much traffic from users who are trying to access the same information. As a result, the servers crash, and everyone on the network loses their connection. Torrents work on “Peer-to-Peer” technology described above, by transferring data between systems. However, with P2P transfers, it’s possible to move large volumes of data on a platform, without experiencing any difficulties of overloading servers and networks. P2P transfers can occur on the BitTorrent protocol, a system used to transfer files online. How BitTorrent WorksBy installing a BitTorrent client on your device or computer, you can access these P2P networks, allowing you to download torrent files that contain all your favorite entertainment. You capture small pieces of information from all the seeds on the system, piecing together the data to allow you to host it on your device or PC.The trackers in the torrent file make it easy for the protocol to identify the relevant data in the transfer, recording the number of seeds for the torrent file, as well as the total downloads, file size, and peers seeding the file.“Leeching” describes a practice where people download the torrent file from the network, but don’t leave their connection available after to seed the data back to the system. The community frowns on this process, so if you have unlimited bandwidth available, consider giving back to the community some time.BitTorrent, the company, was purchased by Justin Sun, Creator of the Tron Blockchain platform in 2018.DisclaimerWhile the BitTorrent protocol is entirely legal, the unapproved use of the software to download and distribute copyrighted content is illegal. The regulators are in a constant battle with torrent sites, with torrenters trying to prove that the use of trackers and BitTorrent metafiles don’t store any file contents.Regulators will always be in a struggle with torrenting sites. Some sites have harder times with the authorities than others. However, it’s best to ensure that you remain anonymous online when using a torrent service.Download and install a VPN for your device or laptop before you start downloading. Use a VPN when downloading.

Movies, series, Blu-ray, HD 1080p, whatever you want – it’s all there, and it’s all for free. There are millions of torrents on the site.

You’ll find the wallet addresses for the community at the footer of the page.This site features many millions of visitors every month. Still, it’s probably a lot more than the registered traffic, as plenty of the users utilize proxies, VPNs, or mirrors to gain safe access to The Pirate Bay.

You get a wide selection of torrents, including music, e-books, software, movies, and series.It’s also strange to think that the Russian government banned and blocked the site in 2015, showing the average Russian’s ability to circumvent international cybersecurity laws using tools like a virtual private network (VPN).According to Alexa, Rutracker ranks as the 256th most popular site online.VisitEztvYear Founded: 2005Monthly active users: 42.26-millionGlobal Site Rank: 897This torrent distribution group is one of the most well-known brands in the niche.

However, it’s clear to see the reason why this site never reached the popularity levels of TPB. The site comes packed with pop-up ads that are frustrating to deal with, and you get the unnerving feeling that this site is after your data.However, if you’re willing to take the risk, you can download a wide range of TV shows, movies, games, software, and music form this platform.VisityourbittorrentYear Founded: 2003Monthly active users: 1.02-millionGlobal Site Rank: 30,313This site was initially called myBittorent upon its launch back in 2003. However, the platform changed its name to yourbittorent in 2009. the change occurred due to a split in the ownership of the platform. This site is a little different, and it doesn’t’ directly host the torrent file on the site.Instead, the site hosts the information on the file, giving the location of an indexed file. This platform was the first-ever website to experience seizure by a registrar. The events occurred due to the arguments between the owners over the future of the site.Despite the site’s tainted history, the user-interface is easy to use. There are plenty of verified links to all types of content, from TV shows to movies and music.VisitbtdigYear Founded: 2011Monthly active users: 1.69-millionGlobal Site Rank: 29,136Before the use of torrents for distributed peers, trackers were the only method of locating peers with content to share online. The usage of Distributed Hash Table (DHT) by BitTorrent clients helps to find peers for the file via a BitTorrent protocol. This system offers a means of distributing tracking, gaining significant popularity thanks to its decentralized approach of file transfers.BTDigg relies on the use of DHT protocols for file searches, and the site itself provides a clean and user-friendly interface. The website collects metadata for the DHT network, and one of the key advantages is that no torrents are involved in the running of the site, and there is no content on the site’s servers.Your search results display torrent-related information, such as the size, name, age, and the number of files. The listing also provides a single link for execution with your BitTorrent client.Visittorrentdownloads.meYear Founded: 2007Monthly active users: 13.54-millionGlobal Site Rank: 2, 943This torrent indexer is another platform that survived the test of time.

The first reason is the entertainment on tap, there no need to pay for streaming services when you can download torrents for free.You also get a better range of media on torrent sites. For instance, on the Pirate Bay, you can find movies, TV shows, series, documentaries, e-books, video games, software programs, and anime. That kind of selection isn’t available on any streaming site, and you’ll need multiple subscriptions to handle that kind of action.With torrent files, you also get to keep the files. That’s especially important when you’re dealing with software programs and e-books. Transferring data in a P2P manner also benefits business.It’s for this reason that many companies that handle large volumes of data now integrate P2P solutions in systems to save on bandwidth and server storage space.Are There Any Disadvantages in Downloading Torrent Files?As you can see, there are plenty of advantages to using P2P file transfers. Torrents are handy ways to share information, but there are also risks and limitations associated with handling torrents.For instance, access to secured files is easy to manage through servers, but it’s far more challenging with torrents. The backup files on the server also assure that it’s easy to restore files if the central hub shuts down.Downloading torrents can also consume plenty of bandwidth. If you’re working on a limited data plan, then make sure you check your consumption. If you decide to seed back to the network, then you’ll also be using bandwidth for this process.Do I Need a VPN to Download Torrents?No, you don’t need to have a VPN if you want to download torrents online – but you should. There are thousands of stories about how torrent sites can damage your data and your machine.Countless stories are floating around online, from installing viruses and malware in torrents downloaded to computers, to identity theft and extortion. The internet is a wild place, and you need protection to keep your identity and data safe while downloading torrents.Using these sites without the assistance of a VPN is like walking down the road naked. Everyone starts paying attention to you, and some people might want to come in for a closer look. If they think you have something of value to offer them, they might decide to rob you.However, being robbed online isn’t the same as in the real world. If some thug sticks you up in an alleyway with a knife, you know that someone robbed you.However, online, you won’t even realize it happened until you get a call from the credit agencies saying you suddenly are outstanding with a large loan payment you never knew existed.Identity theft and fraud online is a real thing, and you need to protect yourself and your computer from any online threats that could cost you your livelihood.Which VPN to use?We have reviewed a number of VPNs, as follows:Avast VPNExpress VPNNord VPNCyberGhost VPNAVG VPNPure VPNHow Does a VPN Work?A VPN is a third-party software available from numerous providers. After downloading and installing the software on your machine, you open a user dashboard.On your dash, you’ll see servers listed in various countries, such as the USA and UK. By clicking onto one of these servers, you route your connection to the internet through the proxy addresses used by the VPN. As a result, your ISP and hackers can’t see you online; essentially – you’re invisible.Therefore, with a VPN, you don’t have to worry about anyone discovering your IP address. You also don’t have any concerns about someone accessing your machine remotely through a virus. A VPN offers you the safest means of downloading torrents.How do I Download a Torrent?Downloading a torrent is easy. All you need to do is download a torrent client, install it on your device or PC. After its running, log in to any of the sites mentioned in this review.Follow this step-by-step process for downloading your first torrent file.Step 1 – Download a torrent client like uTorrent or qbittorrent from an official website.Step 2 – Search the torrent site for your media fileStep 3 – Click the magnet icon on the file you want to downloadStep 4 – Select the path or drive to save the file on your device or PCStep 5 – Click OK, and start your downloadNOTE: Priority will always go to the first file that starts downloading when working with simultaneous downloads or multiple files.Using torrents to access your favorite media, software, and internet tools is a great way to stay entertained while stuck indoors.As long as you have an internet connection or Wi-Fi, you can always download torrents.What are the Types of Torrent Sites?We can categorize torrent sites into private and public venues. Public torrent sites, also known as “open trackers,” will permit access to any user when accessing the tracker address. Fortunately, downloading files from these platforms is a straightforward process.Private torrent sites, otherwise known as private trackers, will limit access to members. In most cases, members are only able to register through invite-only. Existing members must approve permission for new members to access the platform and issue an entrance code via email.Private sites may also require members to meet specific seeding goals to keep the network alive.Public trackers offer you the best option for ease of use. These platforms are open, so the chance of downloading a bad piece of software or malware is a risk you’ll have to learn to mitigate if you want to continue to download torrents.The advantage of private trackers is that the members all experience a vetting process before joining the network. Therefore, there is much less risk of a malicious software ending up in your torrent transfer.    6,247"
48,Blockonomi,JPMorgan: Central Bank Digital Currencies Threaten U.S. Dollar’s Dominance,Nick Chong,1590164037.0,"For decades, due to the power that the U.S. wields in finance and in war, the U.S. dollar has been the reserve currency for the world. A majority (if not all) central banks hold the currency, a majority of global commerce involves the transaction of greenbacks, and the U.S. dollar has performed extremely well over many foreign currencies over the past few decades.Yet a new report from JPMorgan Chase & Co. indicates that the long unquestioned dominance of the U.S. dollar will soon be threatened by the rise of central bank digital currencies.JPMorgan: Central Bank Cryptos Threaten U.S. Dollar’s Reserve Currency StatusContents1 JPMorgan: Central Bank Cryptos Threaten U.S. Dollar’s Reserve Currency Status2 A Timely Report3 Bitcoin Is a Threat As WellAccording to Bloomberg, analysts at the multinational bank said in the report that the introduction of digital currencies by big central banks will potentially threaten the efficacy of the U.S. dollar in global commerce. They wrote:“There is no country with more to lose from the disruptive potential of digital currency than the United States. This revolves primarily around U.S. dollar hegemony. Issuing the global reserve currency and the medium of exchange for international trade in commodities, goods, and services conveys immense advantages.”JPMorgan did say that it is unlikely the U.S. dollar will be toppled as the world’s reserve currency anytime soon, though it’s likely disruptions will take place in certain sectors where digital currencies make sense over dollar systems — such as the SWIFT payment network, which is slow and costly compared to newer digital tech.A Timely ReportJPMorgan’s report is very timely: the past few months have seen the fundamental case for central bank digital currencies gain strength due to the outbreak of COVID-19.An April 3rd bulletin from the Bank of International Settlements — the so-called “central bank of central banks” — indicated that COVID-19 is accelerating the world’s distaste for cash payments, making CBDCs that much more logical: “Resilient and accessible central bank operated payment infrastructures could quickly become more prominent, including retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).The pandemic may hence put calls for CBDCs into sharper focus, highlighting the value of having access to diverse means of payments, and the need for any means of payments to be resilient against a broad range of threats.”The report also coincides with an increase in resistance to the U.S. dollar by central bankers.Mark Carney, an economist who served as the head of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, said at a central banker meeting in the U.S. last year that there should be a push for a global stablecoin to end the dominance of the dollar. He postulated that the U.S. dollar may actually be hurting certain economies, especially those deemed “emerging market,” explaining:“The dollar’s influence on global financial conditions could similarly decline if a financial architecture developed around the new [digital currency] and it displaced the dollar’s dominance in credit markets. By reducing the influence of the US on the global financial cycle, this would help reduce the volatility of capital flows to emerging market economies.”Bitcoin Is a Threat As WellJPMorgan identified central bank digital currencies as a threat, but that’s not to say that Bitcoin and decentralized cryptocurrencies hold a role in macroeconomic trends too.Some investors are coming to grips with the long-term impacts of the ongoing recession and the central bank response and are finding that Bitcoin is making more and more sense as a macroeconomic play.Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge fund investor, made this narrative apparent when he announced this month that he will be personally and professionally investing in Bitcoin because he sees it as a hedge against the debasement of fiat currencies.    3,037"
49,Blockonomi,Iran Pushes National Bitcoin Mining Plan as Chinese Region Tries to ‘Ban’ Mining,Nick Chong,1590160269.0,"Just five years ago, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were a fringe asset class that was unnoticed by most.  But as the digital asset market has gained value over the past three years, the attention this industry gets has increased at a rapid clip — so much so that there are now governments trying to form national cryptocurrency mining strategies.Iran Starts to Push for Crypto Mining Regulation and PlanContents1 Iran Starts to Push for Crypto Mining Regulation and Plan2 Governments May Respond3 China Is Taking a Different RouteIranian President Hassan Rouhani is moving to implement a national strategy for cryptocurrency mining, though details have not yet been hashed out, ARZ Digital reported earlier this week. Rouhani made these comments in front of officials from the Central Bank of Iran, the Department of Energy and Information, and other ministries pertinent to Bitcoin mining.The strategy will purportedly involve the regulation of private mining operations and the management of cryptocurrency mining revenues, which would allow the government to tax Bitcoin from miners.The pretense for this move was not made clear by ARZ Digital, though Crypto Twitter has postulated that this is a move to increase Iran’s dominance in the Bitcoin space and to prevent capital from leaving Iran’s borders.Governments May RespondMax Keiser — a former Wall Street trader turned one of Bitcoin’s most public and outspoken bulls — believes that Iran’s move towards getting a national grip on mining will spark a game-theoretic response from other nations that will drive prices higher.“Bitcoin is unconfiscatable, uncensorable, digital Gold (but better), and going to $400,000,” Keiser wrote in response to the breaking of the story.It could also be theorized that by delving into Bitcoin mining on a truly national level, which would allow Iran to garner millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies to potentially bypass sanctions, the U.S. would be forced to seriously respond to “the threat of” cryptocurrencies.It’s not like this is without precedent.In November 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control “took action” against “Iran-based individuals” by blacklisting their Bitcoin addresses. The individuals were involved in a ransomware scheme that made thousands of Bitcoin, the Treasury alledges.And earlier this year, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration and the Treasury were taking the threat of cryptocurrencies seriously, especially in regards to sanctions. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the time:“We are about to roll out some significant new requirements… We want to make sure that technology moves forward; on the other hand, we want to make sure cryptocurrencies aren’t used for the equivalent of old Swiss secret number banking.”China Is Taking a Different RouteWhile Iran is looking to control Bitcoin mining, reports indicate that China is once again looking to shut down its cryptocurrency mining industry entirely.On Friday morning, the screenshot seen below of a Chinese government announcement began to make its way around Twitter. Asian-focused blockchain and financial technology media firm PANews said on the image:“The Financial Administrative of the Sichuan province of China has issued a notice to its subordinate offices ordering them to ‘guide [Bitcoin and crypto] mining entities to end their mining activities in an orderly manner’.”Sichuan is notably one of the world’s most centralized locations for Bitcoin mining due to the region’s reliance on hydroelectricity, which is abundant in supply and cheap — good conditions for miners.Though, according, to Matthew Graham, the chief executive of Sino Global Capital, the fears of a ban are overblown:“China is not banning mining, it’s complicated as usual, messages frequently conflict especially at local or regional level. Actual message is basically ‘don’t use local government support for mining to illegally raise money’. Thank you,” Graham wrote, trying to dissuade the fears of a Chinese crackdown on BTC.    2,949"
50,Blockonomi,New Baseline Protocol Demo Hints at the Future of Big Business On Ethereum,William M. Peaster,1590151609.0,"Earlier this year, mainstream firms like Microsoft, AMD, and EY joined forces with cryptoeconomy stalwarts like ConsenSys and Chainlink to create OASIS, a non-profit standards body for contributing enterprise-friendly Ethereum code to the public domain.At the time, the collaborators unveiled their flagship initiative would be Baseline Protocol, an open-source system aimed at providing “secure and private business processes at low cost” atop Ethereum’s public mainnet.Since Baseline’s reveal, it’s become an increasingly high-profile project around Ethereum. That’s not just because of the impressive cast of contributors behind the effort but also because of the initiative’s potential to make Ethereum mainstream financial infrastructure.That’s why heads turned anew this week when the Baseline Protocol published a promising proof-of-concept demo that shows the the initiative is poised to be a major contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem in the years to come.A Dream System for EnterprisesContents1 A Dream System for Enterprises2 Making Ethereum More Accommodating3 Big Companies Already Building on EthereumBaseline Protocol’s new demo illustrates a novel process dubbed baselining, a technique that entails using Ethereum to “prevent data inconsistencies” across mainstream Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, i.e. automated back-office software.Notably, then, Baseline’s fresh proof of concept shows how baselining can be used in tandem with two of the most popular ERPs around. On this point, the project’s press release explained:“The procurement use case in the demo … highlights how two Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Microsoft Dynamics and SAP can maintain consistency with each other using blockchain technology without exposing information about business activities or relationships to competitors or the public. Its use of the public Mainnet reduces capital expense while increasing operational integrity when automating business processes across multiple companies.”Making Ethereum More AccommodatingEthereum’s ran away with the lead in the smart contract platform rat race in recent years, to be sure.Yet when things were still more wide open in that regard, more than a few debates unfurled about whether big enterprises would be able to stomach using a public blockchain like Ethereum or whether they would congregrate to private blockchain’s like J.P. Morgan’s Quorum.The discussions have brokenly decisively in Ethereum’s favor as the project’s ecosystem has continued to rapidly mature, and the arrival of things like Baseline Protocol and the baselining process are certainly factors in the general warming to the mainstream possibilities of public blockchains.To this end, Blockchain Research Institute co-founder Alexander Tapscott said upon the baselining unveil:“The Baseline approach is a windfall for global enterprises looking to boost security and performance. Data is secured, contracts are governed digitally and companies can collaborate seamlessly without changing their current systems. This will change how enterprises interact in a digital setting.”Moreover, the technique is only the latest work by the Baseline Protocol team. It most certainly won’t be the last. Beyond the project’s other solutions to come, the protocol’s inaugural release is “expected in Fall of 2020.” At that point, the system’s wider possibilities are only set to grow.Big Companies Already Building on EthereumAs time goes on, Baseline Protocol should make Ethereum increasingly attractive as enterprise infrastructure. But what’s notable is that big companies are already experimenting with the reigning smart contracts platform in the here and now.For example, just this month Reddit rolled out an Ethereum-powered community tokens pilot program and Visa had a patent application come to light for a “digital currency” that could be implemented on Ethereum.These initial forays are on the more simplistic end of the activity spectrum when compared to the more advanced processes that tech like Baseline Protocol can open up for enterprises. Even still, these developments show there is early demand for using a maturing Ethereum.    2,920"
51,Blockonomi,Watch Out Libra: Stablecoin Backed by Major Asian Currencies Could Be Coming,William M. Peaster,1590151461.0,"Last summer, Facebook brought the concept of basketcoins, i.e. stablecoins backed by multiple assets rather than just one, into the limelight with its reveal of the Libra project.Since then, Facebook and the other 26 members of the Libra Association have notably backed away from plans for a pure basketcoin product. The retreat isn’t because basketcoins aren’t viable, to be sure, but rather because multiple regulators have made it clear they don’t want Facebook releasing its own de facto stab at a world currency.Zooming out, this retreat has paved the way for another, more nimbler institution to outmaneuver Facebook in releasing a major basketcoin project similar to what the Libra was originally envisioned as. According to news out of China this week, among the institutions to do so first could be the People’s Bank of China (PBoC).Regional Asian Basketcoin ProposedCryptoeconomy chatter around China’s central bank has lately centered on the institution’s in-progress digital yuan, the highest-profile central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative in the world right now. Yet the bank may help release a separate basketcoin project first.That’s per a proposal delivered this week amid China’s “two sessions,” which are the national legislative and advisory conferences held annually in the Asian superpower.The advisory session, dubbed the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), is not akin to a meeting of the U.S. Senate or the U.K. House of Lords. And at the body’s latest session, Neil Shen, a founding partner of Sequoia Capital China and member of the CPPCC, joined with 9 other specialists to call for the creation of a PBoC-backed basketcoin.In particular, Shen and his peers suggested the new digital currency should be underpinned by reserves of the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, and the Korean won. The proposed basketcoin’s reserves would be weighted according to the performance of the economies of China, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea as such.Why a basketcoin, then? The initiative’s proposers said the digital currency could spur trade and optimize cross-border payments for the participating nations. They also said it could be launched in close coordination with Hong Kong Monetary Authority and alongside a regulatory sandbox aimed at boosting related innovations.It’s entirely possible this basketcoin proposal doesn’t move any further in China’s contemporary landscape, but it’s live for consideration now and demonstrates once again that digital currencies are becoming a mainstream topic at China’s highest political levels.A Sore Spot for Facebook?There’s no question that with Facebook’s global reach, the Libra basketcoin as originally envisioned could have come to rival traditional world currencies. That’s why the Libra effort hit a regulatory firestorm early on, and that’s why rumors swirled earlier this year that Libra’s initial model was going to have to be reconfigured.That’s why analysts in the cryptoeconomy weren’t surprised back in April when the Libra Association published an update to the Libra’s whitepaper for the first time. Per the redesign, the body was henceforth going to be releasing multiple single-currency stablecoins, e.g. one pegged to the dollar, another pegged to the euro, and so forth.With that said, the Libra Association said it would still back a Libra offering, just in indirect fashion and thus not in token form.“Under this change, ≋LBR will simply be a digital composite of some of the single-currency stablecoins available on the Libra network,” the new whitepaper explained.The retreat will likely leave the Libra Association thinking what could have been. That is especially true if the PBoC does end up bringing a real basketcoin product to market while avoiding widespread international regulatory pushback.    2,035"
52,Blockonomi,France Announces Successful Test of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC),Osato Avan-Nomayo,1590151313.0,"The central bank in France has announced a successful test of a proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC), becoming the latest nation to run pilot demonstrations of sovereign virtual currencies.With the initial test completed, the Banque de France says it has more experiments to conduct with the digital euro involving interbank settlement protocols.Meanwhile, China continues to be the clear leader in the race for supremacy in the CBDC arena with its proposed DC/EP currency already been trialed in different cities across the country. Facebook’s Libra project is also looking to get off the ground with more members joining the Libra Association while the payment platform undergoes operational changes targeted at smoothening regulatory wrinkles.France’s Central Bank Tests Proposed Digital EuroContents1 France’s Central Bank Tests Proposed Digital Euro2 France’s Becoming More Crypto-Friendly3 CBDC Race Still OngoingThe Banque de France announced the news of the successful test of the CBDC via a communique published on Tuesday (May 20, 2020). According to the press release, the French central bank tested the CBDC in the settlement of digital financial securities issued by Société Générale Forge.Reports indicate Société Générale issued about $44 million in security tokens back on May 14. The Bank de France using its in-house blockchain infrastructure settled the issuance of the covered bonds using digital euros.An excerpt from a statement issued by Société Générale explaining the process reads:“This experimentation was performed end-to-end using blockchain infrastructures…It demonstrates the feasibility of financial securities being digitally settled and delivered in Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) for interbank settlements.”Back in December 2019, Blockonomi reported that France had plans for central bank digital currency trials in 2020. According to the communique, the country’s central bank will hold other tests to determine the suitability of the proposed CBDC.This next round of trials will utilize the digital euro in interbank settlements. The French central bank also wants to see how participants in the legacy finance arena interact with a sovereign digital currency.France’s Becoming More Crypto-FriendlyFrance has been vocal in its calls for the European Union (EU) to consider the creation of a digital euro for the region. Like was the case for robust crypto regulations, it appears the authorities in France are not waiting for the EU to chart a course forward.In its communique, the French central bank described the CBDC tests as its contribution to any EU-led CBDC project. The country is also one of the major economies opposed to Facebook’s Libra digital payments project.The CBDC tests also constitute another example of France’s growing appreciation for cryptocurrencies. Back in early March, a French court ruled Bitcoin (BTC) as being a currency. The country’s Finance Minister also removed taxes on gains from crypto-to-crypto trades in September 2019.CBDC Race Still OngoingThe French CBDC test comes even as China is already in an advanced testing stage of its proposed sovereign digital payment system. As previously reported by Blockonomi, wallets for China’s DC/EP are already available in four cities with each city working on a unique use case. Major restaurants and fast food outlets like McDonald’s’, Starbucks, and Subway have also been invited to participate in the DC/EP trial run.Even countries like South Korea and the United States that are not actively developing a CBDC have issued statements indicating their intention to study the merits of creating their own sovereign digital currencies. In February, the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman revealed that the country was working hard on a digital currency project.    2,350"
53,Blockonomi,New Report Suggests U.S. Military Is Losing Blockchain Race to China & Russia,William M. Peaster,1590151206.0,"Recent war game scenarios suggest the U.S. is ill-prepared to contend with the combined military might of China and Russia. Now, a new report suggests the U.S. is also increasingly lagging behind its biggest geopolitical rivals when it comes to militarizing blockchain technology.That report, titled “Potential Uses of Blockchain by the U.S. Department of Defense,” was published on May 20th by the Value Technology Foundation, a non-profit think tank centered on blockchain tech.The publication, which counted among its contributors major firms like Amazon Web Services and IBM as well as cryptoeconomy mainstays like ConsenSys and Wachsman, is aimed at educating U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) officials on how blockchain can be used to enhance multiple elements of America’s military activities.Land of the Free, Home of the Blockchain?In recent years, U.S. Representative Darren Soto has established himself as one of America’s most pro-blockchain legislators. It’s no surprise, then, that Rep. Soto wrote the foreword for Value Technology’s new blockchain report.In that foreword, Rep. Soto warned that China and Russia have already respectively “invested millions of dollars worth of research and development” into blockchain initiatives, whereas American legislators were “still trying to understand what the technology is” and “still trying to enforce old laws” around the tech.With that said, Rep. Soto noted Value Technology’s report was a step in the right direction for the U.S. and pointed toward progress to come:“When I see the creativity of thought in ways of applying blockchain technology to support the Department of Defense in this paper, I am reminded of what a free and democratic society can do when called into action.”Toward Optimizing U.S. Military OperationsThe DoD is a sprawling organization involved in a sprawling range of activities, and its leadership routinely focuses on making the expansive U.S. armed forces more efficient. Value Technology’s report argued that blockchain could particularly increase DoD’s efficiency in the following areas:“multi-domain command and control”“acceleration of procurement” “management of mobile device assets”“enhancement of supply chains” “additive manufacturing,” e.g. 3D printing vehicle partsThe supply chain suggestion is hardly surprising, as enhanced logistics have long been touted as one of blockchain’s most promising use cases, and the U.S. military has no shortage of logistical problems when it comes to fraud, waste, and abuse that blockchain could help mitigate.However, what’s really interesting is seeing the report’s comments on blockchain’s ability to boost “multi-domain command and control,” i.e. implementing command structures that don’t have single points of failure and can operate with multiple heads.This area is of huge concern to DoD, as a hypothetical war with a near-peer ally like China or Russia would likely entail these adversaries taking decisive strikes at the U.S. military’s key command structures. The body would fail without the brain, as it were.Accordingly, Value Technology argued that blockchain tech can bring “antifragile properties” across DoD’s key operations, a dynamic that would be hugely advantageous during times of crisis:“When it comes to the decision-making process during emergency and catastrophic events, it is critical that the state and effectiveness of large operational networks and ecosystems remain functional, which [blockchain] can help to ensure.”Whether the U.S. military’s leaders will take such recommendations and run with them remains to be seen, but the mere fact that this kind of paper was produced and presented in the way that it was suggests blockchain could play a much bigger role in the defense sector in the years ahead.Logistics use cases will probably come first, naturally. But more advanced possibilities are becoming increasingly imaginable as time goes on.    1,502"
54,Blockonomi,Prominent Ethereum Commentator Thinks ETH 2.0 May Lead to Deflation,Nick Chong,1590075284.0,"Ethereum 2.0 has not even launched but commentators are trying to speculate as to what effect this sweeping blockchain upgrade will have on Ether’s monetary properties and characteristics.One prominent Ethereum commentator has suggested that with the introduction of staking and a certain improvement to the blockchain’s codebase, the number of ETH will actually decrease over time.Ethereum Could Soon Have a Negative Issuance RateContents1 Ethereum Could Soon Have a Negative Issuance Rate2 ETH 2.0 Could Rally3 Jury Still Out on Launch DateEric Conner — part of the product team at Ethereum-centric startup Gnosis and the co-host of the Into the Ether podcast — remarked that over the past week, Ethereum has generated 1,900 coins in fees. This annualizes to ~700,000 coins spent if fees remain this high all year round.This is important as with the introduction of Proof of Stake with Ethereum 2.0, Conner estimates that with 10 million coins staked (~8% of the total supply of the cryptocurrency), ~575,000 coins will be generated each year.The introduction of a “fee burn” to the Ethereum blockchain, meaning coins are deleted whenever you send a transaction, “it’s very likely that we will eventually get to negative annual issuance.”Over the past week, the Ethereum network has generated ~1900 ETH in fees a day, or ~700k ETH annualized.At 10mn ETH staked in PoS, the network will produce ~575k ETH a year.With fee burn in eth2, it's very likely that we will eventually get to negative annual issuance.— eric.eth (@econoar) May 20, 2020It’s important to point out that the analyst’s expectation of negative issuance after ETH 2.0 is largely dependent on the abnormally high fees Ethereum users are experiencing at the moment.As reported by Blockonomi previously, the analyst “Ceteris Paribus” observed that the cost of gas on Ethereum as of May 15th reached 41 Gwei, up around 300% from the end of April. Most of the time, the Gwei cost of gas is around 10, though it often falls even lower towards 4-6. This trend has continued, with ETHGasStation reporting a 67 Gwei gas cost if Ethereum users want their transactions finalized in two minutes.Gas prices on Ethereum have been skyrocketing over the past month. Average gas price is now 41 Gwei, up 4x since end of April.It uses oscillates between 10-15 outside of high periods of stress (i.e. Black Thursday). pic.twitter.com/RJmdquQNdC— Ceteris Paribus (@ceterispar1bus) May 15, 2020These fees are subject to change as fee market dynamics change, potentially placing the negative issuance narrative in jeopardy.ETH 2.0 Could RallyAlthough modern economies have not had much experience with the persistent deflation of a fiat currency’s monetary base, commentators say that Ethereum 2.0 could benefit ETH’s price. After all, leading cryptocurrencies are largely a game of scarcity, similar to how commodities and precious metals operate in the real world.Angel investor and professor Adam Cochran wrote in an extensive Twitter thread that Ethereum 2.0, through staking, the fee burn, and other mechanisms, will cause a simultaneous supply shock and demand shock for Ether, pushing up prices at a rapid clip:Ethereum 2.0 is the perfect combination of instant spikes, repetitive buying loops, competitive race conditions to drive up a short-term price, and just the right amount of background growth rate to catch that price before it falls, and offer a steady growing network thereafter.He went as far as to say that Ethereum 2.0 could be “the largest economic shift in society.” Jury Still Out on Launch DateWhile many investors are hopeful for the launch, the jury is still out on when Ethereum 2.0 will launch.Some developers have suggested July, while others have suggested late summer.Even BitMEX’s research team weighed in, writing in a recent report that they think things will go wrong with ETH 2.0, causing even more delays than the upgrade has already sustained:Ethereum 2.0 is exceptionally complicated. With so many committees, shards and voting types it seems reasonably likely that something will go wrong and that there will be significant further delays.    1,988"
55,Blockonomi,"Bitcoin Plunges Under $9,000: What Do Analysts Think Comes Next?",Nick Chong,1590074957.0,"Just over 24 hours, investors were expecting Bitcoin to push past $10,000 for the first time in weeks. Now, the cryptocurrency is plunging lower, recently reaching a low of $8,930 — the lowest price since May 13th, just two days after the block reward halving. Bitcoin price chart from TradingView.comThe 10% retracement from the weekly highs coincides with a suspicious transaction from an early BTC address, created in February 2009 after its owner mined 50 coins in one of the earliest Bitcoin blocks.Investors first thought that this was Satoshi Nakamoto dumping his coins. As the cryptocurrency creator is believed to own over one million obtained by mining the blockchain in 2009 and 2010, investors believed that this was the start of a larger sell-off, hence the price drop.But, even after the fears that the transaction was by Satoshi were disproven by multiple blockchain analytics firms and prominent commentators, BTC has continued to slide lower.This likely to do with the fact that market factors indicated a correction in the Bitcoin price was on the table, making the Satoshi fears just a catalyst for an eventual move. As reported by Blockonomi previously, one trader identified that at $9,800, Bitcoin’s bullish momentum had slowed, open interest in the futures market had increased, and the funding rates of futures contracts had trended positive — three textbook signs of a reversal.For the time being, analysts are expecting more downside as the cryptocurrency begins to fall below crucial support level after support level.Bitcoin Could Be Subject to Further DownsideOne prominent crypto trader shared with his Telegram channel that Bitcoin is currently looking bearish, citing a loss of momentum and a bearish volume trend.Bulls look very weak since sustaining the bounce yesterday. Momentum has been lost and volume is bearish.He then published the chart below, indicating that Bitcoin’s price action looks eerily similar to the last two times the cryptocurrency traded around $10,000. The last two times Bitcoin’s chart looked as it did, crashes ensued. Chart from “Filb Filb”Other analysts echoed this bearish sentiment, pointing to how the cryptocurrency just lost important support levels like $9,000 and specific moving averages.Long-Term Demand Drivers Still PresentThe expectations of a short-term drop have not snuffed out the presence of drivers of demand that will boost Bitcoin in the long run.Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior commodities strategist, Mike McGlone, wrote on Twitter just hours before Bitcoin’s latest leg lower that he sees key indicators “supporting BTC’s ability to sustain above $10,000” eventually:There is an increasing number of active Bitcoin addresses.At the CME, there is “record-high futures open interest.”The assets under management of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust has hit an all-time high.Key indicators support #Bitcoin's ability to sustain above $10,000. Increasing addresses used, record-high futures open interest and assets under management (AUM) of GBTC support the digital version of gold's value and the crypto's similar direction to the advancing metal. pic.twitter.com/jMWw6Cz97u— Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) May 21, 2020The optimistic medium to long-term outlook was echoed by analysts at BlockTower Capital, a crypto and blockchain investment fund.In a research note published earlier this week, the firm identified a potential perfect storm of fundamental events and trends that will likely increase Bitcoin demand. These include but are not limited to:Bitcoin has begun to decouple from the S&P 500 and other traditional markets, which may drive demand from all types of investors trying to hedge their portfolio.There are potential tensions between the U.S. and China as the geopolitical implications of the COVID-19 outbreak increase.There has been an “erosion of trust in central banking.”Due to COVID-19, much of the world has become increasingly acclimated to using technology, meaning cryptocurrencies and other forms of digital currency make that much more sense.Emerging market economies are starting to get crushed, resulting in dropping foreign currencies against the dollar. This may drive demand for Bitcoin, which can act as a safe haven.    1,738"
56,Blockonomi,tBTC Team’s Path Forward After Early Emergency Pause on Ethereum,William M. Peaster,1590071105.0,"Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens can be used to tokenize just about anything, including bitcoin (BTC). To that end, Ethereum’s rising tokenized bitcoin sector has been experiencing an explosion of activity in recent weeks.One of the most promising newcomers to the scene is Keep Network’s tBTC token, which has been designed to be mintable using BTC and redeemable for BTC in trust-minimized fashion.tBTC’s trustless model makes it attractive in Ethereum’s decentralized finance arena whose most dominant tokenized bitcoin project to date has been WBTC, which relies on a trusted third party in BitGo.When tBTC launched to the public on May 11th, then, the DeFi community buzzed with excitement. However, just one week later tBTC’s builders initiated an emergency pause of the project after discovering a problematic bug in the token’s smart contract.“The team triggered this pause after finding a significant issue in the redemption flow … when certain types of bitcoin addresses were used in redemption,” the Keep team explained in a post-mortem report.The necessary move marked a considerable temporary setback for the tBTC project, but fortunately the redemption bug was discovered early enough in the token’s lifespan that amends can be made and tBTC can be hardened without any major losses of user funds.Moving ForwardtBTC’s smart contract employs a 10-day pause mechanism for unanticipated emergencies like the one the token ran into this week. The Keep team activated the emergency pause on May 18th to give themselves a grace period to shield users and identify a suitable bugfix.That’s precisely what Keep’s done since. In their post-mortem report, Keep noted they’d already secured more than 99 percent of the tBTC supply in the wake of the token system’s emergency pause and were on track to collect the remainder of outstanding tokens.Moreover, developer James Prestwich has already submitted a potential fix to the redemption bug in Keep Network’s tBTC GitHub repository, which means tests are incoming.Additionally, Keep confirmed they’d be engaging with the auditing specialists at Trail of Bits to “identify any additional areas of the system that may merit additional scrutiny.” If everything checks out, then tBTC can be brought back online in the not so distant future.“In addition to the technical and process changes we’ll be making, in the coming days we will also announce how we plan on approaching a redeploy of the tBTC system,” Keep said.Demand for Tokenized Bitcoin GrowingOnce tBTC gets things back on track, it has major potential to experience further adoption in the DeFi ecosystem. Why? Tokenized bitcoin efforts are booming around Ethereum lately, and a trust-minimized project like tBTC is very attractive to the space’s decentralization purists.Even still, though, more centralized projects like WBTC have been seeing a surge in adoption recently. That dynamic suggests there is certainly an appetite for a range of tokenized bitcoins on Ethereum.Indeed, a MakerDAO user collateralized 1,000 WBTC in a Maker Vault on May 20th in order to draw out an automated self-loan of 4 million Dai. On the heels of that major activity, MakerDAO Rune Christensen took to Twitter to hail the event as just a sign of things to come:“4 million Dai was just minted with WBTC in a single transaction. This really showcases the latent demand for non-ETH assets, and it’s the beginning of a broader trend of DeFi acting as an economic vacuum that will eventually attract almost all value to the Ethereum blockchain.”In time, Keep’s tBTC may be voted in as an approved MakerDAO collateral type, too. And with other promising projects on the rise like PieDAO’s BTC++ and Ren’s renBTC, tBTC likely wouldn’t be the last tokenized bitcoin voted into Maker, either.    1,674"
57,Blockonomi,Crypto Exchanges to Obtain License Under Iran’s Proposed Bill Amendment,Osato Avan-Nomayo,1590070973.0,"The Iranian parliament recently met to review its currency smuggling laws to properly define the concept of currency smuggling and punish offenders. However, the proposal does not cover currency smuggling, but also extends to crypto exchanges.While most exchanges operate outside of Iran, the proposed amendment seeks to license exchanges, which could further stifle the growth of the crypto industry in the country.Iran Mandates Licensing Regime for Local Crypto ExchangesAccording to ArzDigital, on Monday (May 18, 2020), the Islamic Consultative Assembly in one of its sessions proposed to amend the law on smuggling of currency and goods. In the amendment, the lawmakers stated that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be subject to the country’s currency smuggling and foreign exchange rules.With the proposal, crypto exchanges will have to obtain an operating license with the Central Bank of Iran and follow strict guidelines. One of the cases considered a violation of the rule includes:“Carrying out foreign exchange brokerage services inside the country for persons abroad, without having the permission to perform exchange operations from the Central Bank. The broker is the person who receives the currency for the currency traded in the country.”The government’s proposed amendment seeks to curb capital flight. Failure to comply with the directives will earn defaulters a hefty fine and sanctions. While the lawmakers are placing cryptocurrencies under the proposed amendment, it is not clear how the government will mandate exchanges to obtain licenses. This is because some Iranian crypto exchanges are located abroad.Iran’s attitude towards the nascent technology has not been entirely smooth. Back in July 2019, a top official of the Central Bank of Iran ruled bitcoin trading in the country as illegal because of the associated risks. Also, a draft crypto regulation by the government early in 2019 banned the use of bitcoin and other virtual currencies as a payment method in Iran.Crypto Adoption in Iran Amid Crippling HyperinflationWhile bitcoin trading activities are prohibited in the country, the cryptocurrency mining industry continues to flourish in Iran. The country’s low electricity rates have attracted lots of bitcoin miners to the jurisdiction looking for cheap energy.According to a report by Blockonomi in July 2019, the government of Iran officially recognized the crypto mining sector as industrial activity in the country, with miners also having a special electricity tariff.The government later in Septemeber 2019 announced a tax exemption for bitcoin miners who bring their foreign earnings home. Early in 2020, Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mine, and Trade issued 1,000 licenses to bitcoin miners to legally carry out mining activities in the region.Iran’s economy has continued to plunge over the years, with the Gulf Nation struggling with serious hyperinflations. The current official exchange rate stands at 42,000 rials to $1, with the black market’s exchange rate being several levels higher.In a bid to manage the crippling economic situation, authorities in Tehran redenominated the rial by removing four zero digits and changing it to toman, making each toman equal to 10,000 rials.The Gulf Nation has also been blocked from the international financial scene, following the strict sanctions placed by the U.S. President, Donald Trump. Consequently, Iran has sought cryptocurrency to circumvent the sanctions. There were reports about the government looking to develop its own digital currency.Back in December 2019, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani during a summit in Malaysia called on Islamic nations to collaborate to create a Muslim cryptocurrency. According to Rouhani, such currency will help to remove them from the dominance of the U.S. economic hegemon. Also, an Iranian commander asked the country to use crypto to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions.    1,664"
58,Blockonomi,“Save Yourself” With Bitcoin and Gold: “Rich Dad Poor Dad” Author,Nick Chong,1589994415.0,"Bitcoin and the equities market may have both mounted rapid comebacks from their March lows, but there remain economic storm clouds brewing on the horizon. As Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, explained in a recent speech, the ongoing recession caused by the COVID-19 outbreak is one “without modern precedent.”The rate of COVID-19 infections is slowing in many places, yet many of the world’s largest economies remain in lockdown, with spending coming to a standstill as dozens of millions have become unemployed. Governments have been forced to act, injecting billions upon billions into their respective economies to ensure the stability of society.The issue is, due to an absence in spending, tax collections have plummeted while government spending has increased, leaving sovereigns with rapidly increasing deficits. It’s a trend that many say proves the value of Bitcoin, gold, and other “hard” assets.Bitcoin to Boom as “USA Goes Broke”: Robert KiyosakiIt’s been hard to miss Robert “Rich Dad” Kiyosaki’s tweets over the past few months.The prominent financial educator and entrepreneur, best known for his book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has issued tweet after tweet (in all caps) calling out Wall Street, the government, our central banks, and about any other financial and fiscal institution in authority.In doing so, he’s also promoted Bitcoin, gold, and silver, which he claims are “real” forms of money in a world of fiat currencies, which he has dubbed “fake money.”Kiyosaki made this much clear in a tweet on May 19th, in which he remarked that due to the decrease in tax receipts and increased spending, the “USA [is] GOING BROKE.” The response, the financial educator said, is to “get gold, silver, Bitcoin” to “SAVE YOUR SELF”NEW YORK CITY GOING BROKE. All cities count on INCOME TAX, SALES TAX & REAL ESTATE TAXES, especially  COMMERCIAL RE. Add pension contributions for teachers firefighters & police. USA GOING BROZkE. FED PRINTING FAKE $ cannot SAVE YOU. Get gold silver Bitcoin and SAVE YOUR SELF.— therealkiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 19, 2020This comes shortly after he remarked that the failing economy and money printing by central banks will push Bitcoin towards $75,000 in the following three years. This is actually a mild price prediction when compared to what other prominent investors think Bitcoin will trade at in the coming years.He’s Not Wrong; Other Analysts Agree WIth His AssessmentWhile Kiyosaki’s comment was obviously jazzed up, so to say, other analysts are coming to the same conclusion that he is: as the world’s governments build up massive deficits to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19, they are proving the case for the decentralized and scarce Bitcoin.In an extensive research note titled “Demand is Coming” published this week, crypto fund BlockTower Capital explained that the “macro case for Bitcoin has never been more obvious.”While they cited many reasons to back up this claim, the argument came down to one central trend: money printing.The firm explained that the Federal Reserve has lost the public trust and is promoting the inflation of the dollar by continuing to print trillions and dropping interest rates to 0%. Decreased faith in and the debasement of fiat money should increase demand for Bitcoin, BlockTower postulated.Parker Lewis of Unchained Capital summed up this narrative well when he wrote the following in a recent essay on Bitcoin’s role in the ongoing macroeconomic crisis:When governments and central banks can no longer create money out of thin air, it will become crystal clear that backdoor monetary inflation was always just a ruse to allocate resources for which no one was actually willing to be taxed. In common sense, there is no question. There may be debate but bitcoin is the inevitable path forward.    1,901"
59,Blockonomi,"A Satoshi-Era Wallet Just Moved 50 Bitcoin. But Apparently, It Isn’t Satoshi",Nick Chong,1589991661.0,"As many readers are likely well aware of, just hours ago, a Bitcoin address created in February 2009 sent its first transaction, transacting 50 coins generated by mining to two other addresses.50 BTC is not a large amount of money in macro terms — it’s around $500,000 in a market worth in excess of $175 billion. Though fears quickly spread about the implications of this transaction.The immediate theory was that due to the proximity of this address’ age to the first block of the Bitcoin network, it was Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto that sent the transaction. The pseudonymous coder is expected to own approximately one million coins from 2009-2010, when he was one of the only few people working on Bitcoin or mining BTC.With this transaction marking one of the first movements of early-2009 coins ever, this conclusion was to be expected. But chain analysis firms have tried to calm the markets, saying that from how they see it, there’s a low likelihood that it is Satoshi Nakamoto, who has purportedly not sold a single coin.It Isn’t Satoshi Nakamoto, Blockchain Analysis Firms SayContents1 It Isn’t Satoshi Nakamoto, Blockchain Analysis Firms Say2 Craig Wright Has Laid Claim to the BItcoin Address 3 The Adverse Price ImpactAccording to Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter, the Satoshi-era address involved in this whole debacle does not fit what we know about addresses that are actually affiliated with Satoshi, who purportedly only mined a “specific set of” Bitcoin blocks. Carter explained:Here’s a visualization of the Patoshi pattern with the block that was just spent. The blocks believed to be Satoshi have a specific pattern in the nonce, which this block does not have. Chart shared by Nic Carter of early Bitcoin block dataThis was corroborated by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode along with adopters of Bitcoin that were around early on in the cryptocurrency’s life.Craig Wright Has Laid Claim to the BItcoin Address With the jury still out on who sent the transaction, self-proclaimed Bitcoin creator Craig Wright is entering the conversation once again.A court document for a case between Wright and the estate of Dave Kleiman (Dave Kleiman is another early Bitcoin adopter, one who purportedly mined a stash of coins early on) indicates that the address that sent the 50 coins is owned by Wright — that’s to say that he says he owns those coins.Notably, the document was filed late last year, meaning that the inclusion of the pertinent address to the list was not something that took place recently.Critics have tried to disprove the list, saying that while it does look like a collection of addresses that one early Bitcoin adopter owns, it may not be Wright that has or had access to the keys relating to said addresses.The Adverse Price ImpactWhile the initial fears that this transaction is related to Satoshi Nakamoto have since subsided, this news event has had an adverse price impact on the cryptocurrency market.The price of Bitcoin dropped from $9,800 to a low of $9,100 in the two hours after the transaction was sent, though prices have since recovered to the $9,500 range. Bitcoin price chart from TradingView.comThe movement of old coins wasn’t the market catalyst that analysts were expecting, but some think it’s the start of a larger reversal.As reported by Blockonomi previously, crypto derivatives trader Cantering Clark identified three trends transpiring in the Bitcoin market indicative of a short-term top and an imminent reversal:Bitcoin’s momentum was slowing, with the price stalling at $9,800Open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has risen while prices have stagnatedThe funding rates of Bitcoin futures markets have trended well into the positive, suggesting the market is overbought.    1,853"
60,Blockonomi,Crypto Exchange AAX Partners with Solidus Labs to Combat Market Manipulation,Osato Avan-Nomayo,1589988772.0,"Atom Asset Exchange (AAX) — an institutional-grade crypto trading platform — is partnering with Solidus Labs to use the latter’s market surveillance tools in combating manipulation in the cryptocurrency trading space.The move is part of efforts by the London Stock Exchange (LSEG) Technology-backed exchange to improve its compliance with increasingly robust regulatory standards.Crypto forensics is increasingly becoming important for exchange platforms especially as regulators in some jurisdictions are beginning to mandate that market participants improve market monitoring and surveillance. This insistence is part of global efforts to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and terrorist financing.AAX to Deploy Solidus Labs’ Market Surveillance ToolsContents1 AAX to Deploy Solidus Labs’ Market Surveillance Tools2 Crypto Forensics Required for Greater Institutional Adoption3 Eradicating Market Manipulation in the Crypto Trading SpaceAccording to a press release shared with Blockonomi, AAX revealed its collaboration with Wall Street-based Solidus Labs to use the latter’s cryptocurrency surveillance framework. As part of the partnership, AAX will have access to Solidus Labs’ suite of surveillance and compliance software to detect potential market manipulation and other forms of cryptocurrency trading abuse.The use of Solidus Labs’ crypto forensics framework upgrade’s AAX’s crypto market surveillance infrastructure to the standards set by participants in the mainstream asset trading arena. AAX plans to use the tools to detect spoofing, wash trading, cross-market manipulation, and pump-and-dump schemes among others.Commenting on the partnership, AAX CEO Thor Chan remarked:“We believe that all investors, retail and institutional, deserve fair markets, where prices are accurate and trade volumes are real. We are excited to partner with Solidus Labs to provide state-of-the-art market surveillance.”Crypto Forensics Required for Greater Institutional AdoptionAAX tapping Solidus Labs for full-spectrum crypto trading forensics comes as regulators across the globe are insisting on total compliance with robust licensing and regulatory requirements. Indeed, jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Malaysia have introduced detailed listing requirements for cryptocurrency businesses in their respective markets.In New York, the state’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is also insisting on crypto companies adhering to industry-standard market monitoring protocols, stating:“VC Entities are required to implement measures designed to effectively detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, attempted fraud, and similar wrongdoing.”The NYDFS insisting on crypto companies deploying robust crypto forensic protocols is also making the notoriously difficult BitLicense even harder to obtain with Bittrex not getting the nod back in April 2019.According to Chan, the move towards robust crypto forensics apart from helping platforms comply with regulators moves the industry into greater maturity. With rogue trading actions like spoofing and price manipulation out of the way, more sophisticated products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can emerge.Indeed, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has consistently identified the absence of effective market surveillance as one of the reasons for refusing to approve a Bitcoin ETF. Many crypto pundits view investment vehicles like ETFs as major on-ramps for the entry of more institutional money into the cryptocurrency space.Eradicating Market Manipulation in the Crypto Trading SpaceExchanges are increasingly moving towards deploying crypto trading monitoring systems. As previously reported by Blockonomi, Chainalysis has partnered with a few platforms to utilize its Know-Your-Transaction (KYT) compliance. Cryptocurrency exchanges already using the KYT infrastructure include Paxful and Bitfinex.Apart from Chainalysis, Nasdaq is also providing cutting-edge crypto monitoring services to cryptocurrency exchanges via its SMARTS Market Surveillance toolset. Back in 2019, reports emerged that about seven crypto exchanges — including Gemini and SBI Virtual Currency — were already utilizing the Nasdaq technology in combating illegal trading activities.    1,725"
61,Blockonomi,Decentralized Exchange dYdX Is Seeing Major Volume on Ethereum,William M. Peaster,1589979488.0,"Decentralized derivatives exchange dYdX has proven to be an early star for Ethereum in recent times. That reality was driven home anew this week as trade volume around dYdX’s new perpetual bitcoin swap offerings exploded.Last month, the dYdX first unveiled its Perpetual Contract Markets system, and the release’s first offering was a bitcoin perpetual swap contract that offered up to 10x leverage indefinitely in the BTC-USDC market.That alpha bitcoin perpetual swap offering went public on May 13th, 2020, and since then dYdX has seen an acute surge around its trading volumes. As the dYdX team said on the launch:“dYdX is building a world-class BTC trading product — not just for DeFi, but for the broader crypto market. Traders prioritize liquidity, functionality and the security of their funds, making dYdX the ideal platform to start trading BTC.”Just as projected, then, the dYdX platform has seen a major influx of new trading activity around its BTC products. To this end, users are starting to come around to the platform’s novel possibilities.dYdX Volume SurgesOn Tuesday, May 19th, the daily trading volume on dYdX surpassed the $17 million USD mark. For comparison, the closest challenger on the day was decentralized exchange darling Uniswap, which facilitated more than $10 million in trades on Tuesday.What’s notably here is that dYdX even acutely flipped Uniswap when it comes to daily volume. In recent weeks, Uniswap’s been basically unchallenged when it comes to daily and monthly trading volume metrics.Accordingly, for dYdX to start pulling in major volume over Uniswap this week means that dYdX currently has things really attractive going for it, e.g. the platform’s new trustless bitcoin perpetual swap offering.Yet don’t think the dYdX builders didn’t see this explosion of popularity coming. As dYdX founder Antonio Juliano noted earlier this year:“Perpetuals give users an easy and capital efficient way to get leveraged long or short exposure. We expect this trend to apply to DeFi as well, and for the trading volume of decentralized perpetuals to quickly surpass all spot DeFi trading volume.”If that dynamic plays out, then it’s icing on the cake for dYdX, which is already one of the most profitable DeFi platforms in the Ethereum ecosystem. If dYdX’s builders can continue to roll out novel derivatives that don’t have traditional analogues, the platform has a strong chance to continue winning over lots of new users in the years ahead.BitMEX DowndYdX is a decentralized application, which means it runs all day and all night, so long as Ethereum is running … and mind you, Etherum has perfect uptime for all intents and purposes.With that said, dYdX is accessible at all times for millions of users around the world. But the platform’s more centralized competitors can’t boast such extensive accessibility.For example, on May 19th BitMEX, one of the largest centralized bitcoin derivatives exchanges in the world, saw its trading engine go down. The massive outage was obviously hugely consequential to thousands of global traders. In its wake, the BitMEX team said:“We can confirm all funds are safe, delayed orders will be rejected, and no liquidations will occur during the downtime. On coming back online, there will be a cancel-only period initially.”In this sense, this week dYdX served as a foil to BitMEX: dYdX worked excellently in decentralized fashion while an embattled BitMEX struggled as much as ever.There is certainly plenty of room for both centralized and decentralized exchanges around Ethereum, but it is definitely notable that lately decentralized exchanges are starting to demonstrate more and more major advantages over their centralized counterparts. That could be a big deal going forward.    1,901"
62,Blockonomi,Meet Rai: A Governance-Minimized DeFi Project Set On a More Stable Version of ETH,William M. Peaster,1589979144.0,"Last fall, MakerDAO, the leading DeFi lending project to date, rolled out the Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) system, which opened up new collateral types to underpin automated Dai stablecoin loans beyond just ether (ETH).However, MakerDAO’s pivot toward embracing more centralized assets like USDC and WBTC in recent weeks has led to some Ethereum community stakeholders seeking to build a more conservative, streamlined version of MakerDAO that can work in a minimal and mainly ETH-centric fashion.Here, cue in the MetaCoin project.The Rise of MetaCoinContents1 The Rise of MetaCoin2 MetaCartel Ventures Is In3 Whitepaper ReleasedBack in February 2020, MolochDAO founder and SpankChain CEO Ameen Soleimani published a proposal for the so-called MetaCoin v0 stablecoin system.“The goal of such a system isn’t … to usurp DAI’s position as the de facto decentralized stablecoin, but rather to create a safe alternative for those who have different risk preferences,” Soleimani said at the time.As originally set out, then, the MetaCoin model was an ETH-only collateral system that was underpinned by a META governance token (think MKR or COMP in the MakerDAO and Compound ecosystems, respectively) as well as COIN, a Dai-like analogue.Two months after MetaCoin’s reveal, blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu of Reflexer Labs took the MetaCoin project’s efforts to the next level with the introduction of “reflex bonds,” a new ETH-centric DeFi collateral type that could underpin MetaCoin’s COINs in very stable fashion. Ionescu explained at the time:“The purpose of a reflex-bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while still maintaining a high level of trustlessness. If used in other protocols, a reflex-bond can shield its users against major and sudden moves in the cryptocurrency markets. For example, if Maker had used reflex-bonds as collateral prior to Black Thursday, [Maker Vault] creators would have had more time to avoid complete liquidation.”The good news, then, is that reflex bonds are getting ready to hit the prime time in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.MetaCartel Ventures Is InEthereum’s two most high-profile decentralized autonomous organizations to date have been the Moloch DAO and the MetaCartel groups.Zooming in on MetaCartel, the DAO made waves last December in spinning out a for-profit venture capital arm dubbed MetaCartel Ventures (MCV).“If paired with relevant investing experience, we will be able to identify high value early opportunities that other investors are oblivious to,” the MCV team said at the time.Fast forward a few months, and just a matter of days ago MetaCartel Ventures made its first investment into Reflexer Labs, the team that’s building out the reflex bond infrastructure that’s going to serve as the foundation for the MetaCoin project.Whitepaper ReleasedThis week, the Reflexer Labs group published a whitepaper for its first reflex bond offering , the RAI. Therein, the project’s team explained:“A reflex bond’s purpose is not to maintain a specific peg, but to dampen the volatility of its collateral. Bonds allow anyone to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without the same scale of risk as holding actual crypto assets. We believe RAI, our first reflex bond, will have immediate utility to other teams issuing synthetics on Ethereum … because it gives their systems a lower exposure to volatile assets such as ETH and offers users more time to exit their positions in case of a significant market drop.”In the years ahead, then, RAI has a real chance to become a force to be reckoned with in the DeFi space, namely as a very reliable collateral type for lending projects like Maker, Compound, and Aave.In the mean time, what matters is tracking how RAI performs in the wild. Can stablecoin without a direct peg bring real stability to DeFi? Only time will tell, but many are watching.    1,695"

This, coupled with decreasing prices, is purportedly indicative of a “weak” market, according to a commonly-shared market interpretation table of price, volume, and open interest.The funding rates on Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts — the fees long positions pay to short positions to maintain the market — has trended higher and higher. This signals that longs are becoming more aggressive with their buying. Logically, that may lead you to think that prices will go higher due to buy-side activity. But high funding rates are often seen at the tops of trends as long positions become increasingly unsuitable to hold.I am in a small long but it's really just targeting the next sticky area at this high.Need to be careful at this level.-Momentum is slowing-OI increasing-Funding going more positiveThe resistance is resistance until it no longer is.$BTC— Cantering Clark (@CanteringClark) May 17, 2020Adding to this, one trader observed that there is a block of sell orders around $10,000 on leading exchanges like Bitfinex and Binance, which will halt any short-term rally. The data suggests that as of May 17, there was around ~4,200 Bitcoin worth of sell orders from $9,900 to $10,600, the majority of which are clustered in and around $10,000-10,400.The on-chain metrics share a similarly-bearish story. Three of crypto intelligence firm IntoTheBlock’s metrics — “smart price,” “net network growth,” and “large transactions” — are currently bearish. Bitcoin metrics from IntoTheBlockStocks Could Fall TooAdding to the bearish outlook that Bitcoin has in the short term, an increasing number of analysts and billionaire investors are expecting the stock market to retrace, which could drag the cryptocurrency market lower with it.Speaking to CNBC last week, billionaire investor David Tepper remarked that the stock market is “maybe the second most overvalued,” behind the Dotcom bubble at the turn of the century:The market’s pretty high and the Fed’s put a lot of money in here … the market is by anybody’s standard pretty full. There’s a lot of liquidity there and the Fed’s still there. It’s too hard to say the market can’t go up or something like that, but it’s not a very good risk-reward market.This was echoed by legendary macro investor Stan Druckenmiller, who said that the risk-reward for equities is the worst he’s seen in his entire trading career.Bitcoin, of course, could rally through a falling stock market, but the Kansas City Federal Reserve has found that during times of economic “stress,” the cryptocurrency operates in concert with the stock market.    2,114"
64,Blockonomi,Bitcoin Mining Revenue on the Decline Since Block Reward Halving,Osato Avan-Nomayo,1589905681.0,"Bitcoin mining revenue is down by almost 50% from its pre-halving level with hash rate also showing a similar decline.The halving event which saw block rewards cut in half appears to be significantly impacting the bottom-line for miners especially as a new difficulty adjustment is yet to happen.Meanwhile, transaction fees are now accounting for a significant portion of the revenue earned by Bitcoin miners, reaching levels not seen since 2018On the price side, BTC appears to be caught in a sideways accumulation phase between $9,500 and $9,800, signaling a massive resistance at the $10k to $10.1k level.Bitcoin Mining Revenue and Hash Rate TumbleContents1 Bitcoin Mining Revenue and Hash Rate Tumble2 Fees Now Accounting for 15% of Miner Revenue3 Will Price Follow?According to data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin mining revenue in USD has fallen by about 50% since the halving event took place a few days ago. The halving which reduces block rewards by half means a decrease in the inflation causing daily BTC supply to go down from 1,800 BTC to 900 BTC. Source: Blockchain.comWith the daily supply reducing by half, mining nodes are having to compete for fewer available new BTC. Many of these Bitcoin mining operations have recently installed state-of-the-art hardware to boost their chances of beating the rest of the competition.The network hash rate — the computing power expended to secure the network — is also on the decline. Inefficient miners not able to compete are shutting down their machines and exiting the network.The exodus of a significant amount of hashing power creates a shortfall in the computing power expended on the network. Again, the emergence of a decline in hash rate post-halving is not surprising.Once the next downward difficulty adjustment occurs, the effect of the current miner exodus should be mitigated. Bitcoin has historically recovered from hash rate plunges even those incorrectly characterized as mining death spirals and there is little evidence to suggest the current situation will be any different.Fees Now Accounting for 15% of Miner RevenueMeanwhile, transaction fees now account for more than 15% of Bitcoin mining revenue, according to data from crypto analytics provider Glassnode. Not since the ‘crypto-mania’ hype of late 2017 and early 2018 have fees represented such a significant portion of the BTC miner earnings. Source: BitInfoChartsThe increase in Miner revenue from fees comes amid a continuing rise in Bitcoin transaction fees. BTC fees are currently at their highest level in almost a year with BitInfoCharts showing transaction costs averaging $5.83.With the increasing level of on-chain activity coupled with the reduction in block rewards, miners are prioritizing transactions with higher fees. Thus, the mempool is experiencing a growing backlog of unconfirmed transactions with significantly lower fees.While the current fee hike is considerable, it is little compared to the spike seen in 2017 when transaction costs went as high as $50. The introduction of SegWit has helped to prevent the occurrence of such massive fees and once the next downward difficulty adjustment occurs, the mining space will regularize leading to a decrease in transaction costs.Will Price Follow?While the Bitcoin appears caught in a sideways accumulation trend, some crypto pundits argue that the BTC price will soon follow hash rate and miner revenue in experiencing a decline. Since falling to $3,800 during Black Thursday — March 12, 2020 — the top-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recovered, even temporarily going above the $10,000 mark in late April.Typically, the Bitcoin price has set a new all-time high in the year immediately following a halving event. On-chain data shows increasing accumulation across both the retail and institutional market segments with investors looking to ride another upward price growth for BTC.    1,823"
65,Blockonomi,Early Bitcoin Investor Is Convinced Rally to $50k-$100k Is Coming,Nick Chong,1589905253.0,"Bitcoin isn’t even past $10,000, let alone its previous all-time high of $20,000, but analysts are already speculating as to where the next bull market will take the cryptocurrency.$50,000-100,000 is a totally rational prediction, one prominent analyst explained. And here’s why.Bitcoin Will Soon Begin a Rally Towards $100,000Contents1 Bitcoin Will Soon Begin a Rally Towards $100,0002 His Track Record3 Others Are ConvincedAccording to Tuur Demeester — founder of Adamant Capital — told cryptocurrency research firm Messari in a recent interview that due to central banks and governments printing trillions of dollars, he thinks $50,000 is an entirely logical price for Bitcoin to rally towards in the coming years:I think a price target of like $50,000 is not insane at all, especially given just how crazy the money printing is. I would even say between $50,000-$100,000.He added that right now, there’s an ongoing “land grab” scenario, with institutions are rushing into the cryptocurrency market to be the first to get a stake in the Bitcoin market — something similar to a gold rush.This increase in demand for Bitcoin, Demeester explained, will only help accelerate the rally to the price points he forecasted.His Track RecordAlthough a $50,000 Bitcoin price may seem like a quixotic dream at the moment, Demeester’s track record should not be understated.He explained in a recent discussion with Kraken’s Dan Held, ShapeShift’s Erik Voorhees, and Litecoin founder Charlie Lee that he first entered the Bitcoin space in 2011. Demeester said he quickly recommended the cryptocurrency, which was then around $5, to followers of the newsletter he was writing at the time.As we well know, buying Bitcoin at $5 is just about one of the best investments you could have made… ever.In November 2015, his company published a report titled “How To Position For The Rally In Bitcoin.” The report covered a swath of topics, but its core point was to convince readers of why having some BTC in one’s investment portfolio makes sense. November 2015 marked the start of an over 6,000% rally from $300 to $20,0000.And early last year, Adamant Capital once again published a report titled “Bitcoin In Heavy Accumulation.” The report postulated that the cryptocurrency would soon enter a bull run, citing on-chain data, historical analysis, volatility trends, and more. Bitcoin rallied 200% in the two months after the report was published.Others Are Convinced$100,000, why not $1 million?Raoul Pal — CEO of Real Vision and a former executive at Goldman Sachs — recently explained that Bitcoin’s technical and fundamental trends in tandem indicate that the asset may rally to $1 million — yes, $1 million — in the coming five years.The long-time fund manager and macro analyst explained that the “KEY technical break” BTC exhibited when it rallied past the $9,500 range two weeks ago have “dramatically” increased the probability it rallies to “vastly higher prices.”Pal added that the confluence of the halving and the world’s central banks printing more money than ever before is only confirming this bullish assertion:This is confirmed by stock to flow models by PlanB and the breakout has happened almost exact at The Halvening. Add to that HUGE the ENTIRE worlds central banks are […] printing money like CRAZY. quantitative easing fiat meets the hardest money that automatically quantitatively tightens.Pal is so bullish that he opined Bitcoin currently has one of the  “best set ups in any asset class I’ve ever witnessed…technical, fundamental, flow of funds, and plumbing.”    1,779"
66,Blockonomi,Ethereum’s Next Big Thing? Uniswap V2 Launches with Major Optimizations,William M. Peaster,1589900879.0,"Automated liquidity protocol Uniswap has become the biggest hit in Ethereum’s decentralized exchange sector to date. Now, the project’s creators have raised the bar for decentralized trading again with the release of the new and improved Uniswap V2 protocol.On Monday, May 18th, the Uniswap team announced that V2 had been activated on the Ethereum mainnet, a move that comes less than 2 years after Uniswap’s first rendition was unveiled in November 2018.Notably, Uniswap V1 will continue running indefinitely on Ethereum, but the trading protocol’s new standalone V2 release brings with it a host of powerful improvements over V1. These improvements make the updated protocol poised to become even more successful than its darling predecessor.What’s New in V2Contents1 What’s New in V22 The Liquidity Migration Begins3 Toward Sustainability?The original Uniswap was already powerful and useful, and Uniswap V2 is that much moreso.One new feature that has token traders excited is V2’s ability to facilitate ERC20 / ERC20 liquidity pools. In the original rendition of the protocol, ETH / ERC20 liquidity pools were the only kind of pools possible.The new protocol’s token-to-token pools give liquidity providers more flexibility in general and can also “improve prices because routing through ETH for a swap between two other assets (say, DAI/USDC) involves paying fees and slippage on two separate pairs instead of one,” the Uniswap team noted earlier this year.Moreover, another one of the most anticipated features of Uniswap V2 is the protocol’s in-built price oracles. As Uniswap has explained:“Uniswap V2 implements new functionality that enables highly decentralized and manipulation-resistant on-chain price feeds. This is achieved by measuring prices when they are expensive to manipulate, and cleverly accumulating historical data. This allows external smart contracts to create gas-efficient, time-weighted averages of Uniswap prices across any time interval.”Additionally, arbitrage traders will love Uniswap V2’s new flash swaps feature, which allows users to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities with no upfront capital and all within a single transaction.“With flash swaps you could synchronously withdraw 1 ETH from Uniswap, sell it on Oasis for 220 DAI and then pay for the ETH on Uniswap with 200 of the DAI you just purchased,” the Uniswap team has said of a hypothetical, flash swap-powered 20 Dai profit maneuver. And that’s just one possibility of many imaginable ones for flash swaps.The Liquidity Migration BeginsProviding liquidity to the original Uniswap’s pools has been an early revenue opportunity for DeFi users.Now, these users will have the opportunity to transition their liquidity into the V2 protocol if they so choose. Uniswap has created a portal to make this transition process easy for those interested.“The migration portal makes the process of withdrawing liquidity from Uniswap V1 and depositing it into Uniswap V2 fast and simple,” the protocol’s builders noted on Monday.Toward Sustainability?The Uniswap team is eyeing growth for years to come.Toward managing and sustaining that growth, the protocol’s builders have implemented a “protocol charge” in V2 that may eventually be turned on. As the team has explained:“To open a path to self-sustainability, the code for Uniswap V2 includes a small protocol charge mechanism. At launch, the protocol charge will default to 0, and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.30%. If the protocol charge is switched on, it will become 0.05% and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.25%.”Of course, the idea is that if this charge is ever turned on, the ensuing revenues will go toward funding Uniswap’s development indefinitely.However, there are no plans for turning this charge on any time soon, and it can only be activated by a “decentralized governance process.” Even so, the mere possibility represents an interesting monetization model for decentralized projects.    1,952"
67,Blockonomi,Ethereum DeFi Smart Wallet App Argent Launches to Public,William M. Peaster,1589900443.0,"With improving user experience (UX) being a key area of need for the Ethereum ecosystem going forward, Argent’s mobile smart wallets are Ethereum’s newly arrived guardian angels.This week, the London-based Argent team launched its smart wallet app to the public after more than a year of beta development. The firm’s wallets are notably underpinned by Ethereum smart contracts, so they offer advanced features, e.g. account recovery and transaction limits, that simpler account-only wallets can’t match.For Argent, then, the idea is to bring a mainstream-feeling app experience to the Ethereum ecosystem that is powerful, secure, and abstracts away crypto-centric elements that aren’t friendly to users, like seed phrases — a decentralized bank in your pocket, as it were.“By making decentralized finance so easy to use we can expand economic opportunity globally and help people to take control and benefit from their digital assets and identity,” Argent CEO Itamar Lesuisse said on launch day.One-Tap Mobile DeFiContents1 One-Tap Mobile DeFi2 On the Heels of a $12 Million Series A3 The Mutualism FactorIn recent months, the ecosystem has seen more wallet projects directly integrating with decentralized finance projects.Back in March, for example, the Coinbase Wallet team unveiled they’d integrated their app with two of the reigning DeFi platforms, Compound and dYdX. The move was a cause for celebration around Ethereum at the time, but it marked but a taste of what can be done on this front. That’s where Argent comes in.Indeed, upon Argent’s public launch, the smart wallet app has taken DeFi integrations to the next level with a currently unmatched array of “one-tap access” options. To start, Argent offers integrations with Aave, Compound, Kyber Network, MakerDAO’s Dai Savings Rate (DSR), PoolTogether, Uniswap V2, and TokenSets.Having such integrations in Argent is promising for DeFi projects like Uniswap, the decentralized exchange’s founder Hayden Adams said on the news:“We’re excited about Argent adding a native integration for Uniswap V2 liquidity provision directly inside their wallet. Having multiple, high quality, interfaces is important for decentralized protocols, and Argent’s implementation provides UX improvements that are difficult to do without smart contract wallets.”Moreover, Argent’s first wave of DeFi integrations is already extensive for an Ethereum wallet project, but it’s also exactly that: a first wave.“In the months ahead Argent will integrate more Dapps and focus on further refining the user experience of crypto,” Argent confirmed in a press release shared with Blockonomi.On the Heels of a $12 Million Series AArgent has been hitting its stride so far in 2020.In March, the smart wallet makers announced they’d secured $12 million in a Series A fundraising round from firms like Paradigm and Index Ventures. Paradigm’s managing partner Matt Huang explained at the time:“Argent has systematically solved some of the biggest usability and security issues in crypto. Their team has a unique combination of cryptographic expertise and experience scaling mobile apps to tens of millions of users. We’re thrilled to partner with them as they help make crypto mainstream in the years ahead.”Beyond the Series A, Argent has also previously secured an additional $4 million in venture funding, bringing the startup’s total fundraising to date to $16 million. In the past, Argent has said its growing war chest will be used to hire more experts that can help extend smart wallets’ possibilities.The Mutualism FactorThe relationship between Ethereum and Argent is mutualistic. Argent can help bring in and retain more users around Ethereum than ever before thanks to its superior UX, while a rising Ethereum will bring new users to Argent in kind.In this sense, by servicing the Ethereum space in an excellent way, Argent serves itself. That’s one of the key advantages Ethereum has right now: a Cambrian explosion of projects that work by making Ethereum that much better.    1,979"
68,Blockonomi,The “60 Minutes” Federal Reserve Chairman Interview is Pleasing Bitcoin Bulls,Nick Chong,1589817664.0,"To most, the going-ons of the Federal Reserve and other central banks are boring. But over the past few months, as COVID-19 has shut down the world’s economy, there has been a growing spotlight on central banks.People are starting to become concerned about whether or not these institutions can not only save the U.S. economy, but save the economy in a way that limits monetary downsides, including inflation or deflation. Bitcoin bugs, especially, have expressed their concern.Federal Reserve Chairman’s “60 Minutes” InterviewWith the increased scrutiny the public has put on central bankers over recent months, CBS’ world-famous show “60 Minutes” decided to run a segment on the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jerome Powell.To most, the 15-minute interview was probably innocuous and very reassuring.Powell said in response to a question about the expectations of a V-shaped recovery that he thinks the road to recovery is near:Well, I would say the main thing is to get back on the road to recovery. And I think that can happen relatively soon, likely to happen in the second half of the year. That’s a reasonable expectation.The central banker also said that the trillions of dollars the Federal Reserve has already spent on injecting liquidity into different facets of the economy may be just the start of a larger wave of stimulus:There is a lot more we can do. We’re not out of ammunition by a long shot. No, there’s, there’s really no limit to what we can do with these lending programs that we have.Again, these soundbites were likely reassuring to the millions of Americans who are worried about losing their jobs and their businesses, but to Bitcoin investors, these soundbites were like death blows to the fiat system.Could Send Bitcoin to Fresh HighsBitcoin investors were quick to champion the interview as a way to validate the cryptocurrency’s bull case.Marty Bent, a prominent Bitcoin podcaster and commentator, said in his newsletter that Powell’s comment that the trillions worth of liquidity is simply “printed digitally” makes it clear that Bitcoin “is the answer”:The combination of the inability for anyone to create new bitcoins out of thin air, the fact that bitcoins can be divided very granularly, transported across the Earth with ease, and protected in one’s mind is REVOLUTIONARY. The world no longer has to be subjected to poor decision making from a few men with perverse incentive.Financial analyst Preston Pysh echoed this, saying that the reason he owns Bitcoin is “BECAUSE the Federal Reserve isn’t out of tools by a long shot.”The reason I own #bitcoin is BECAUSE the Federal Reserve “isn’t out of tools by a long shot.”— Preston Pysh (@PrestonPysh) May 18, 2020It may seem as though Powell’s words are being twisted to fit a narrative, but there are prominent investors and analysts that are flocking to Bitcoin because they see it as a hedge against money printing, a hedge against central banking.Legendary hedge fund investor Paul Tudor Jones publicly announced his support for Bitcoin after ignoring the cryptocurrency for years. The reason: he thinks that with the monetary and fiscal response to COVID-19, there’s a real risk of inflation, which warrants the need for a portfolio hedge such as Bitcoin. Unlike fiat, he explained in a research note, Bitcoin is absolutely scarce, making it likely to outperform in a world where traditional money is worth less and less.As put best by Mike McGlone, an analyst at Bloomberg: Central-bank liquidity may restrict the equity bear, yet it’s a prime catalyst to relaunch bull markets in quasi-currencies.    1,784"

Rowling, was asking about Bitcoin — and she was genuinely interested.“I don’t understand Bitcoin. Please explain it to me,” Rowling said to CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen, who joked that she would “die from happiness” if the author ever pinged her.I don’t understand bitcoin. Please explain it to me.— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) May 15, 2020It was a surprising tweet that caught many in the crypto community by surprise, and many saw it as a potential way to get Rowling to become a public spokesperson for Bitcoin, trying to explain cryptocurrency to her in a way that was digestible.It didn’t work.While Rowling did read the dozens and hundreds of coherent responses she received about the subject, she quickly decided Bitcoin wasn’t for her. Since her original tweet three days ago about Bitcoin, she has been trolling the cryptocurrency community to her 14 million followers. And she has yet to stop.J.K. Rowling Continues to Troll the Bitcoin Space When Rowling first asked about Bitcoin, she got a whole swath of responses. Because she’s what the crypto community calls a “nocoiner,” they tried to make the subject of abstract internet money worth billions of dollars digestible to her and her followers.One individual wrote that “Harry Potter would have never been written in a post-Bitcoin world as it is a solution to the problem that the existence of Nicolas Flamel’s Philosopher’s Stone poses.”  This is in reference, of course, to how Bitcoin has absolutely scarcity while other “rare” items, both in literature and in reality, are not as scarce as many paint them to be.Rowling responded with sarcasm, a lot of it: “Hours and hours of ‘you don’t have to trust a bank’ and ‘it can’t be manipulated by governments’ and not a single one of you thought to mention that BITCOIN GIVES YOU ETERNAL LIFE.”Hours and hours of ‘you don’t have to trust a bank’ and ‘it can’t be manipulated by governments’ and not a single one of you thought to mention that BITCOIN GIVES YOU ETERNAL LIFE. pic.twitter.com/6qyJMGkrZI— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) May 16, 2020Rowling continued trolling just hours ago when she joked that she is “trolling Bitcoin in the hope of boosting my significant Ethereum holdings.” That, too, was sarcastic. One good thing is that she’s not exactly ragging on Bitcoin, unlike some of the cryptocurrency’s other critics who make sweeping assertions like all cryptocurrency owners are “scammers and criminals” and that BTC literally has no value. But that’s not really a good consolation prize, is it?The Silver LiningRowling’s tweets likely aren’t painting Bitcoin and the broader crypto community in the best light, but there’s a silver lining to this debacle: Elon Musk.For some reason or another — maybe he’s a fan of “Harry Potter” — the Tesla chief executive decided to become one of the thousands responding to Rowling’s inquiry about Bitcoin.After Rowling took her first swipe at the crypto community, describing Bitcoin as a whole bunch of “blah blah blah,” Musk replied:Pretty much, although massive currency issuance by govt central banks is making Bitcoin Internet money look solid by comparison.Pretty much, although massive currency issuance by govt central banks is making Bitcoin Internet 👻 money look solid by comparison— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 15, 2020Musk quickly added that he still only owns 0.25 coins — worth just under $2,500 — but this one comment with crypto-viral.He may not have a financial stake in Bitcoin, but the fact that Musk sees the cryptocurrency as intrinsically better, more “solid,” than fiat currencies was enough to make headlines.Musk’s comment on Bitcoin highlights a larger narrative forming in the media: Bitcoin is becoming more valuable, both intrinsically and actually, due to central banks and governments printing trillions of dollars in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdowns.

70,Blockonomi,Exploring Visa’s Digital Currency Patent Application: Toward a New Era of Finance?,William M. Peaster,1589813616.0,"Visa is one of the most successful and consequential payments companies in the world. Where the powerhouse enterprise places its efforts is thus no small matter.That’s why a newly published patent application for a blockchain-powered “digital fiat currency” system by the payments giant is not only legitimizing for blockchain tech in general but also indicates what may be coming to the mainstream payments arena amid increasing hyperdigitalization.Indeed, Visa’s patent mentioned the reigning smart contract platform Ethereum and the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain nearly a dozen times each. Will the future of finance be built on top public blockchains, then?That’s the grand question for now, and Visa’s new patent application is an interesting new wrinkle accordingly. To be sure, Visa may have simply kept its options open with a defensive application. Yet if the firm ever does proceed with a system like the one planned in the filing, the implications will be manifold and major. Let’s dive deeper to better understand the stakes.Patent Comes to LightContents1 Patent Comes to Light2 How the Digital Currency Would Work3 To Libra, or Not to Libra4 Good News for Ethereum & Hyperledger5 On the Decentralization Spectrum6 A Boon for Public Blockchains7 News Comes as Stablecoins Are Booming8 The CBDC Specter9 Will Other Big Firms Follow Suit?10 Blockchain on the BrainOn Thursday, May 14th, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published the patent application in question, which is simply titled “DIGITAL FIAT CURRENCY.”The filing, which was first submitted to the USPTO in November 2018, outlines a stablecoin-like system in which blockchain-based digital currency issuances are linked to actual fiat currency reserves.How the Digital Currency Would WorkPer the application, Visa’s envisioned digital currency entails a central operator, i.e. Visa or beyond, facilitating token issuances atop a blockchain. To this end, the document repeatedly identifies Ethereum as potential infrastructure of choice.Of the system’s general design, the filing’s abstract simply explains:“The central entity computer generates the digital currency … The generating includes recording the digital currency on a blockchain. The central entity computer transmits a notification of the generation of the digital currency. The central entity computer causes removal of the physical currency from circulation in a fiat currency system.Such a model is not altogether dissimilar to centralized stablecoin operations already active in the cryptoeconomy, like the CENTRE-backed USDC project. The main difference is that Visa’s system would be unapologetically centralized, whereas USDC’s backers have taken a rather hands-off approach to their token to date.To Libra, or Not to LibraFacebook shocked the world last summer when it first unveiled plans for the Libra stablecoin. The news kicked up a firestorm among global regulators, who saw the move as Facebook trying to outmaneuver central banks.One of the biggest initial targets of the Libra Association, the Libra’s governing body, was Visa. Yet it turned out that the payments powerhouse never formally joined the association, and in October 2019 the company confirmed it would not be directly backing the controversial stablecoin.However, since Visa’s digital currency patent application was filed just one month after the company’s Libra withdrawal, some will now surely wonder whether Visa wanting to go its own way on blockchain was just as pivotal to its retreat as international regulatory headaches were.Good News for Ethereum & HyperledgerRegardless of what ends up happening with this patent application, the fact that Visa therein repeatedly mentioned Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric as possible underlying infrastructure is a major PR victory for both projects.For now, there’s certainly nowhere better to look: Ethereum remains the undisputed “king of the hill” when it comes to smart contract platforms, while the open-source Hyperledger Fabric project has major contributors like the Linux Foundation and IBM. Just the fact that Visa mentioned these two platforms at all will help their respective momentums going forward.On the Decentralization SpectrumPublic blockchains like Ethereum can be used in many ways. They can give rise to totally decentralized projects like Augur and Uniswap, or they can help power centralized third-party enterprises like the Tether (USDT) stablecoin operation.Obviously then, Visa’s digital currency system — at least as initially outlined — would be near the “completely centralized” end of the decentralization spectrum. With that said, though, what would be interesting to see is if and how Visa’s digital currency would permeate into more decentralized areas of the cryptoeconomy, e.g. like USDT trading on Uniswap.Visa could employ a smart contract whitelisting system to mitigate its tokens running amok in DeFi, though the company wouldn’t necessarily have to.A Boon for Public BlockchainsIn recent years, debates have swirled around the prospects of public vs. private blockchains going forward.As of now, though, public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum certainly have seized the upper-hand when it comes to general viability as infrastructure. That Visa would even note Ethereum as one possible home for a Visa-backed digital currency shows that public blockchains are promising and can truly no longer be discounted in the traditional finance arena.News Comes as Stablecoins Are BoomingThere’s no indication just yet that Visa’s digital currency will actually come to fruition. But the mere prospect of its arrival comes at a time when both centralized and decentralized fiat-pegged stablecoins have been becoming increasingly popular.For instance, this month the combined market capitalization of all active stablecoins reached $10 billion USD for the first time ever. The new milestone shows that demand for fiat-pegged or value-stable tokens is already strong and on the rise.If a major firm like Visa jumped into the rising sector in a big way, then stablecoins in general will have officially hit the prime time. The possibility is closer than ever.The CBDC SpecterAs outlined, Visa’s envisioned digital currency system leaves the door open for central banking institutions to work with the payments company on actualizing central bank digital currency (CBDC) issuances.What’s interesting here is that in Visa central banks would certainly find a reliable and promising partner. In many cases, these banks would naturally be more comfortable using an Ethereum-powered Visa system rather than building their own Ethereum solutions themselves.As such, Visa would be ideal for central banks wanting to issue CBDCs for retail rather than wholesale use, as the company’s consumer base is vast.Will Other Big Firms Follow Suit?Because of its sheer size and success, Visa is a very influential firm. It’s a titan in the payments industry, and its operations are closely tracked by many stakeholders, including high-profile competitors.It’s entirely possible, then, that this new Visa digital currency news causes other large companies to take a second look blockchain-based solutions. If Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric are good enough for Visa, they will be good enough for many others too.Blockchain on the BrainThis patent application isn’t Visa’s first blockchain industry rodeo. Last summer, the company unveiled Visa B2B Connect, a cross-border payments solution built on Hyperledger Fabric.“Launching Visa B2B Connect marks an important industry milestone which will accelerate the evolution of how commercial payments move around the world,” Visa’s Global Business Solutions lead Kevin Phalen said at the time.In the very least, the Visa B2B Connect roll out shows that Visa is not only adept at planning out blockchain-powered systems but also at developing them and putting them into production.If Visa’s digital currency patent gets approved and the company does build out the system, the enterprise certainly has the know-how, the resources, and the reach to bring the solution right into the heart of the mainstream.    2,036"

With Currency.com, any gaps in crypto and real-world market are eliminated – complex trading becomes easier than ever!Visit Currency.comCurrency.com Emerges at Right TimeContents1 Currency.com Emerges at Right Time1.1 A Solid Step in the Right Direction1.2 About The Founders2 The Currency.com Model: Creative Innovation3 Why Use Tokens?3.1 Currency.com Advantages4 Currency.com: The RundownBelarus is a world pioneer in adapting to cryptocurrencies. It has accommodative legislation and is very open to technology. The country developed an officially legal framework that acknowledges and regulates crypto activities, which makes it a perfect development environment for crypto companies.Unlike other nations that tried to make crypto compliant with their old-fashioned legal system, Belarus was one of the first to build a completely new framework for crypto, and it into practice. Currency.com HomepageBelarus also provides enormous supports and incentives to smart financial asset trading, such as offering a favorable tax scheme for crypto transactions and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).Belarus is recognized by consulting firms for how attractive it is for outsourcing services, especially in tech fields. In that context, Currency.com was introduced with a breakthrough initiative.A Solid Step in the Right DirectionNot too long after its establishment in June 2018, the company qualified for authorization by the Belarusian government as a regulated cryptocurrency platform (in November 2018). Just two months later, Currency.com succeeded in attracting a large investment from VP Capital and Larnabel Ventures.The number was not explicitly declared, but some sources revealed it could be $10 million USD.Over just two years, Currency.com has been constantly upgrading its platform and expanding its services. Despite being a young company, its impressive progress can be seen through a number of remarkable events:June 2018: One of the first tokenized trading platform to be launchedNovember 2018: Officially regulated under the approval of Belarus’s High Technological ParkMay 2019: Officially launch tokenized securities trading through a partnership with Capital.comMay 2019: Announcement of mobile applicationOctober 2019: Launch a media platformDecember 2019: Starting a trader contestAbout The FoundersCurrency.com’s foundation and leap forward are being powered by bright minds. The main founder, Viktor Prokopenya, is also the creator of VP Capital, which is an investment firm.With an academic background and also real-world experience, particularly in IT, computer science as well as entrepreneur and finance, Prokopenya businesses have seen success.Prokopenya started Currency.com together with Nikolai Markovnik, an investment law expert, who helped the Belarusian government in drafting IT, blockchain and crypto regulations.The two founders received a lot of backing from Said Gutseriev, a billionaire and chairman of Larnabel Ventures, one of Currency.com’s two largest stakeholders.The Currency.com Model: Creative InnovationCurrency.com’s platform is a place for digital coin exchange with fiat money, but users are also able to purchase or sell many traditional stocks in the form of tokens. Currency.com has created a market with more product categories and flexibility.The company is one of the world’s first companies to apply tokenization technology in its trading platform. In particular, all financial assets on Currency.com, no matter if they are crypto, securities, bonds or fiat money, will be converted into tokens, which carry the value of the tokenized asset.Tokens are the major unit for conducting cross-asset transactions on Currency.com, and everything can be exchanged in tokens. Currency.com Trading PlatformThanks to the close partnership with Capital.com, a British fintech company that is well-known worldwide for its broad access to 2,000+ markets, Currency.com is capable of connecting crypto traders with the real cosmos and diversifying their portfolios.So far, Currency.com has issued and supported over 1,300 tokens that represent cryptocurrencies, commodities, stocks, bonds, indices, and so on. But it doesn’t stop there. Currency.com’s bigger vision is to widen its bucket to reach 10,000 so as to include as many transferable assets as possible.This is how the model works out: Currency.com buys available securities from Capital.com, then tokenize them. Users joining the platform can purchase those tokenized securities with their crypto and gain profit upon price discrepancies.Currency.com obtains revenue from trading fees and other related service charges, for instance, fees of smart asset withdrawals.Why Use Tokens?If you have ever looked into how custodianship works in the financial markets, then you probably understand why tokenized assets have the potential to revolutionize how people trade assets. For example, when a person buys a stock on a major exchange (the NYSE, for example), the actual ownership of the asset may never be transferred to the buyer.The reasons for this arrangement are complex, and the system that exists has grown up over the last few hundred years. Sufficed to say, we have much better options for asset trading today, and tokenized assets offer investors a much shorter chain of custody.In addition to making the process of trading much easier, tokens allow the near-instant transfer of ownership. Instead of relying on a broker to manage cross-asset class trades (and paying the fees), tokens allow investors to move seamlessly across assets, without the need for an intermediary.As we have seen over the last decade, the financial markets don’t always work in the way we hope, and if your bank or broker goes bust, it may be very hard to establish ownership over assets. As long as the tokenization is done correctly, tokens remove this risk and give investors a more direct form of ownership. Buy Bitcoin on the go with the Mobile AppCurrency.com AdvantagesWe are living in a time of change, and Currency.com is embracing all the new technological developments that can help investors. In addition to solid thought leadership, the company has demonstrated that it can integrate next-generation financial technology into practical solutions that can be used today.Currency.com has some wonderful things to offer global financial markets:Currency.com is one of the first regulated token platforms. Its services are fully compliant with all the relevant laws. Belarus is a pioneering nation that has created and implemented crypto regulations, such as Decree No. 8 “On the development of a Digital economy” and strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules.Has lots of products across a range of asset classes. Exchanges like Bitmex, Bybit, or Deribit don’t have the same range of products.Currency.com also has a mobile app, which isn’t offered by Bitmex or Bybit.Clients know that Currency.com has a solid regulatory foundation, which helps raise the company’s credibility and expand collaboration with many other large organizations, for example, Russian Sberbank.Other exchanges that offer some similar services, like Bitmex, have no regulatory backing, which may not be good for traders and investors who need the assurances that regulations provide.The company has a partnership with Capital.com, a secure exchange platform with an extremely broad range of assets. This partnership is great for investors, as it allows the platforms to integrate numerous markets with ease.Currency.com: The RundownIf you are looking for a platform where cryptos, fiat, and other asset classes meet, Currency.com is probably one of the best places to be. It is fully regulated and offers investors and traders some amazing capabilities that would be hard to find anywhere else.Here are some of the reasons why Currency.com makes a lot of sense:Currency.com makes funding easy by accepting various ways for deposits, including by cash, bank transfer, credit card, or e-wallet. Users can maximize their margin thanks to optional token resales on secondary auctions. Belarusian traders get even more, as they receive tax exemption for any income from tokenized transactions.Currency.com continues to improve its ecosystem and build towards an integrated platform that works on numerous devices. An audit in 2018 by Ernst & Young stated that Currency.com is comprehensively compliant and reliable.The team at Currency.com is working on becoming regulated in other countries and regions, from Australia to Asia and the United States.Currency.com is one of the first and fully regulated token trading platforms. It offers great security and many asset classes.Currency.com can be accessed in many ways. Users can use blockchain intelligence tools, such as Elliptic and Chainalysis to track their transactions. Overall, the platform offers great connectivity and oversight.Currency.com is an early mover in the tokenized asset market, and it is positioning itself to grow in an industry that offers investors and traders some big advantages. It has worked hard to be as compliant with regulations as possible, which is a great sign.The trading platform on Currency.com is also well made and is available on many devices. As tokens become more popular in the financial world, it is likely that the kinds of assets that are offered in token form will expand.Currency.com is worth a look for anyone who wants to trade across a range of assets and does so on a single platform. The company is likely to keep expanding its product offerings, and also create more strategic partnerships as time goes on.Visit Currency.com    1,448"
72,Blockonomi,Bloomberg Analyst: Central Bank Liquidity Is a “Prime Catalyst” to Boost Bitcoin,Nick Chong,1589555120.0,"Since the crypto bubble of 2017 that brought Bitcoin from under $1,000 to $20,000 in 12 months’ time, investors have been wondering what will catalyze the next rally.While most have put their faith in the Bitcoin block reward halving, which came to pass early this week, a top commodities analyst says that it is stimulus by central banks that is the “prime catalyst” to start a bull market in both Bitcoin and gold.Top Commodities Analyst Expects Central Banks to Boost Bitcoin HigherBoth the crypto market and the stock market have recovered strongly since the March lows, but credit markets remain tight. The markets are so tight that to save individuals and corporations across weight classes, so to say, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have stepped in with trillions of dollars worth of stimulus. And more is likely on its way.In a tweet published May 15th, Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodities analyst Mike McGlone said that while this stimulus will aid equities, it will especially help “quasi-currencies” Bitcoin and gold:Central-bank liquidity may restrict the equity bear, yet it’s a prime catalyst to relaunch bull markets in quasi-currencies.Increasing demand vs. declining supply and volatility imply Bitcoin is more likely to sustain higher levels vs. the Nasdaq as a global recession approaches. Central-bank liquidity may restrict the equity bear, yet it's a prime catalyst to relaunch bull markets in quasi-currencies pic.twitter.com/c8GCqoBLNH— Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) May 15, 2020McGlone’s assertion has been echoed by other analysts. For one, Teddy Vallee — founder and CEO of Pervalle Global, a global macro hedge fund — recently published the chart seen below.Although the investor was hesitant to call the chart perfect, he explained that there’s a potential correlation between the total amount of assets held on the balance sheets of the world’s central banks (Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, etc.) and the value of Bitcoin on a logarithmic scale. Chart from hedge fund manager Teddy Vallee showing a potential correlation between Bitcoin’s price on a logarithmic scale and the value of central bank assets.Also making this argument is legendary macro investor Paul Tudor Jones, worth in excess of $5 billion.Announcing he is allocating personal wealth and capital from his hedge fund into Bitcoin, the Wall Street veteran said last week that to hedge his portfolio against the effects of monetary inflation, he sees value in BTC. Jones specifically cited Bitcoin’s halving mechanism as a reason why it is so powerful as an investment in a world where fiat money is being printed at a record rate.Not the Only Bullish CatalystAlthough central bank stimulus is core to McGlone’s optimism regarding the future of Bitcoin, it isn’t the only reason why he is bullish.In a report titled “Bloomberg Crypto Outlook: Bitcoin Demand Exceeding Supply,” the analyst laid out a confluence of reasons why he thinks that the price of BTC is slated to head higher in the coming months.The 10-day average of unique addresses used on Bitcoin is “nearing last year’s high.” This is important as the last time the metric exceeded this peak, it “preceded the recovery in the Bitcoin price.” McGlone added that if you plot the number of active BTC addresses over a price chart, the current levels we’re reaching with this on-chain metric suggests a fair price of $12,000 — 20 percent above the current price.As evidenced by the increase in the amount of money flowing into the CME’s Bitcoin derivatives market, the cryptocurrency is seeing increased institutional usage over the past few weeks. McGlone thinks that this equates to “maturation, pressure on volatility, increasing adoption, and price support.”    2,265"
73,Blockonomi,The Cost to Transact Ethereum Has Quadrupled In the Past 2 Weeks,Nick Chong,1589553637.0,"While both Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen strong technical improvements since the last bull run in 2017, the transaction throughputs of these blockchains still can’t handle much stress without fees skyrocketing.This much was made clear over the past few days as many have noted that the average transaction fees on both Bitcoin and Ethereum have skyrocketed.Ethereum Transaction Fees Are SkyrocketingContents1 Ethereum Transaction Fees Are Skyrocketing2 Introduction of Reddit’s Community Points Could Exacerbate Problem3 There Are SolutionsAs observed by the market analyst “Ceteris Paribus,” the cost of gas on Ethereum has reached 41 Gwei, up approximately 300% since the end of April. Most of the time, the Gwei cost of gas is around 10, though it often falls even lower towards 4-6.Although it is hard to tell exactly what is causing this, there are two likely causes:An explosion in popularity of a purported scam called “MMM,” which has spent over 661 ETH in transaction fees over the past month. The smart contract affiliated with the scam is the second-most used contract by fees in the past month.Tether’s USDT has continued to see mass adoption on Ethereum, with a majority of the stablecoin’s supply existing on the blockchain. Due to increased market volatility, USDT is likely being used a lot more than it was a month ago.Gas prices on Ethereum have been skyrocketing over the past month. Average gas price is now 41 Gwei, up 4x since end of April.It uses oscillates between 10-15 outside of high periods of stress (i.e. Black Thursday). pic.twitter.com/RJmdquQNdC— Ceteris Paribus (@ceterispar1bus) May 15, 2020As a related side note, transaction fees on the Bitcoin network have also surged over the past few weeks, with a combination of slower block times and an increase in transaction demand forcing the average transaction fee to $5.161, according to Bitinfocharts.com.This is about ten times higher than it was towards the end of April.What may be happening is because transactions are slow on the Bitcoin blockchain, those looking to transfer value between exchanges to play the market are buying ETH or USDT with their BTC, transacting that to other exchange accounts, thus creating a clog on Ethereum.Introduction of Reddit’s Community Points Could Exacerbate ProblemAlthough there is no way to tell if this clog is going to continue as 2020 elapses, Reddit is expected to roll tokens to the Ethereum mainnet come Q3 or Q4 of this year, which may clog up the blockchain yet again.For those who missed the memo, this week, internet forum Reddit, which is one of the most visited sites in the world with hundreds of millions of active users, confirmed the launch of a new project called “Community Points.”Community Points are tokens for specific subforums on Reddit, which can be used to redeem rewards and get access to certain featured that token holders won’t have access to.For the time being, tokens will only be issued on Ethereum’s Rinkeby testnet for the CryptoCurrency and FortniteBR forums, which have around one million users apiece.But should this beta go well, Reddit intends to migrate these tokens onto the Ethereum mainnet, then release other tokens for other forums as well, creating a massive influx of users in the order of millions.This, of course, could create an immense blockchain clog that may be bigger than anything Ethereum has seen. As Brian Flynn of Ethereum startup Rabbit Hole asked in reference to when CryptoKitties dramatically slowed down Ethereum in 2017:If this is happening on Rinkeby, then what will happen to gas price and blocks when Reddit launches this on mainnet? Won’t we just have another CryptoKitties moment?If this is happening on Rinkeby, then what will happen to gas price and blocks when Reddit launches this on mainnet?Won’t we just have another CryptoKitties moment? https://t.co/XgPFETtSjw— Brian Flynn (@Flynnjamm) May 14, 2020There Are SolutionsInnovators in the space are coming up with solutions for Ethereum’s network clog.Decentralized finance protocol Synthetix and Optimism have begun to beta-test a scaling system called Optimistic Rollups. The system basically compresses blockchain data and migrates the onus of transaction validation off-chain, decreasing fees and increasing potential transaction throughput.There are other rollup projects being worked on that could similarly help Ethereum scale, but Optimistic Rollups seems to be one of the furthest ahead.There’s also the introduction of Ethereum 2.0, slated to begin this year, that may solve scaling issues. But as the upgrade’s first phase only implements Proof of Stake, it may be months or maybe even over a year before Ethereum benefits from the scaling improvements of technologies like block sharding.    2,448"
74,Blockonomi,Binance CEO: Names Africa an Untapped Market for Crypto,Osato Avan-Nomayo,1589552300.0,"Changpeng Zhao, Founder and CEO of crypto exchange giant Binance, has described Africa as an untapped market place with a plethora of opportunities for blockchain technology and widespread cryptocurrency adoption.Africa’s Untapped Crypto MarketDuring an interactive “ask me anything” session on Zoom, CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao popularly known as CZ discussed the possibilities of driving crypto adoption in Africa’s untapped cryptocurrency market.Citing the early days of Binance, CZ revealed that the world’s top cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume has always had active users in Africa since the exchange launched in 2017. Seeing a potential market for crypto trading, Binance expanded its presence to the region with the launch of Binance Uganda in 2018.Since then, the crypto exchange heavyweight has funded a plethora of incubation services that have provided capital for crypto-related startups across Africa. Binance has also enabled trading support and fiat deposits in rands for crypto investors in South Africa. CZ said:“We view the entire African market as a really key market, and this year we were very lucky to be able to find a good banking partner in South Africa, and we are able to now accept banking deposits directly through bank accounts. We will soon be able to launch credit card buying as well. South Africa, and Africa as a whole, is a really important market for us.”Despite Africa’s potential to build a foundation for the widespread crypto adoption, there are many challenges hindering progress. CZ highlighted the number of unbanked Africans and existing barriers to Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes as major problems facing crypto adoption in the region. Attributing these challenges to the banking system in Africa, CZ remarked:“Working with banks there is a little bit more difficult. The banking API interfaces are slightly older or nonexistent, and the number of people having bank accounts is quite low. So, even if you have a bank account support, the overall population you can tap into [is] still in the low double digits.”Driving Blockchain Adoption in AfricaReferencing South Africa again, CZ pointed out that a few local crypto exchanges are already operating successfully but at a relatively small capacity. The Binance CEO also expressed doubts over the sustainability of these exchanges as making profits could prove difficult.As Africa’s banking infrastructure is still catching up to modern standards, buying crypto in the region remains fairly complicated. However, with the introduction of trading pairs in local fiat currencies in countries such as Nigeria, crypto trading volumes are slowly growing. According to data from Binance, daily trading volumes in Nigeria recently surpassed $1 million on the crypto exchange.Furthermore, CZ cited the recent bitcoin (BTC) halving event as another factor that will aid in encouraging crypto adoption in Africa and across the world generally. The Binance CEO explained that:“There is a lot of fiat money being printed, while we’ve just gone through the Bitcoin halving…and the fiat money is being printed in record quantities now. So, I think the cost of everything will increase very soon. We will see hyperinflation. All of those things are actually really good for cryptocurrencies and for the overall blockchain business.”Several developments indicate positives for widespread crypto adoption and blockchain technology utilization across Africa. As previously reported by Blockonomi, sub-Saharan African countries topped the list of the most conducive places to own cryptocurrency, according to a Global Digital Report backed by digital media firms Hootsuite and Wearesocial.Back in April 2019, cryptocurrency options in South Africa were reportedly on the rise. A few months later in December, the South African central bank announced plans to introduce clear cut crypto regulatory policies.    2,194"

76,Blockonomi,Inside Reddit’s Ethereum Embrace: Community Tokens for the Mainstream,William M. Peaster,1589532863.0,"Reddit is a juggernaut of a website when it comes to global popularity.That’s why the Ethereum community hailed one of its biggest adoption milestones yet this week upon Reddit’s beta launch of Ethereum-powered “Community Points” tokens.The first token roll outs will be $MOONS for the r/Cryptocurrency subreddit and $BRICKS for r/FortniteBR, the top subreddit dedicated to the popular cross-platform battle royale game Fortnite.The development is a major one for Ethereum because of the new influx of exposure the smart contract platform’s set to receive accordingly. Per the Alexa web traffic analysis tool, Reddit is currently the 19th most visited website in the world and the 7th most visited in the U.S.Moreover, both the r/Cryptocurrency and r/FortniteBR forums have more than 1 million registered users each, and Fortnite proper still easily notches several dozen million active players monthly. Ethereum has some impressive new pipelines for potential users, as such.How Community Points WorkContents1 How Community Points Work2 New In-Game Currency for Fortnite?3 The Emergence of Loot TokensFor now, Reddit’s Community Points system is in beta, and its inaugural tokens currently only exist on Ethereum’s Rinkeby testnet. However, the pilot program is well fleshed out and points to what may be coming for hundreds of other subreddits. A New FrontierIn a new FAQ on the launch, the Reddit team explained:“Community Points are a way for Redditors to own a piece of their favorite communities. As a unit of ownership, Points capture some of the value of their community. They can be spent on premium features and are used as a measure of reputation in the community.”Each subreddit will be respectively capped at having 250 million Community Points, and subreddits will only start out with preliminary allotments of 50 million tokens. These tokens will be dispensed monthly and will be based on rewarding users for their forum contributions, Reddit said:“People earn Points by contributing to the community, for example by submitting quality posts and comments. Based on these contributions, the community ultimately decides how many Points each person receives.”Interestingly, Reddit can embrace these tokens, but since they are underpinned by blockchain tech, Reddit can’t control how they are used beyond Reddit. That means Community Points may soon trade on decentralized exchanges and be adopted far beyond Reddit’s “walled garden.”New In-Game Currency for Fortnite?Being that r/Cryptocurrency is a crypto subreddit, many of its users won’t find using Ethereum alien at all.What will be really interesting to watch going forward, though, is the extent to which r/FortniteBR embraces $BRICKS tokens since Fortnite isn’t directly related to crypto in any way. However, Fortnite has many young and tech-savvy users that certainly don’t lack the imagination to make $BRICKS their own.And what if $BRICKS ends up being adopted as an in-game currency in Fortnite? 1confirmation founder Nick Tomaino posited the possibility on Twitter this week, and it’s definitely a compelling prospect.What if r/FortNiteBR $bricks evolve into actual Fortnite in-game currency?V-bucks but with grassroots adoption, speculative value and global liquidity.— Nick Tomaino (@NTmoney) May 14, 2020Later on in that same thread, Tomaino argued that the chances of Community Points taking on major activity beyond subreddits was “not lost on Reddit.”Not sure about Fortnite in particular, but I do think an interesting second-order effect of community points will be that they will be used off Reddit on other platforms that the subreddit users care about. This is not lost on Reddit. Why else make points ERC20?— Nick Tomaino (@NTmoney) May 14, 2020The Emergence of Loot TokensAdam Cochran, a partner at MetaCartel Ventures, recently published an excellent in-depth analysis of the top 10,000 Ethereum addresses. Another area that Cochran has been focusing on lately is “loot tokens,” which he argues is an emerging class of crypto that’s distinct from governance tokens, dApp tokens, and beyond.Cochran defines loot tokens as tokens that are “earnable within a community rather than purchased,” and in a new post this week the analyst and investor hailed Community Points as Reddit decisively embracing loot tokens.This is good news for Ethereum, the cryptoeconomy’s top tokenization platform to date, and suggests other websites beyond Reddit will explore similar initiatives in time.    2,432"
77,Blockonomi,DeFi Liquidity Protocol Kyber Network Crosses $1 Billion Trading Volume Mark,William M. Peaster,1589532805.0,"In recent days, the Kyber Network liquidity protocol has accounted for almost 15% of all decentralized exchange (DEX) transactions atop Ethereum.That’s certainly an impressive statistic, but this week the Kyber community is happily celebrating a different milestone.That’s because on Thursday, May 14th, the Kyber Network team confirmed their protocol had finally eclipsed its first $1 billion USD worth of trades. The new record comes after Kyber Network reached its first 1 million ether (ETH) in total transaction volume last summer.🥳We're happy to announce a major Kyber milestone:Kyber has crossed US$1Billion worth of trades and almost 1Million transactions, performed entirely on chain! 🚀 @ethereum #ethereum #DeFi pic.twitter.com/H06qcgYtAD— Kyber Network (@KyberNetwork) May 14, 2020Kyber Network has plenty of room to grow from here, to be sure, just as the wider DEX and DeFi scenes do, too. With that said, the protocol’s first $1 billion worth of trades shows the project is well on its way for now.“We crossed our first billion US$ in total trading volume, but looking to cross the second, third and more in 2020,” Kyber Network co-founder Loi Luu said on the news.2020 has been shaping up well for Kyber so far, then. Back in February, U.S. crypto exchange giant Coinbase rolled out support for Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) trading on Coinbase Pro and then on Coinbase.com a few days later.Unsurprisingly, the legitimizing “Coinbase Bump” has helped to raise the profile of the Kyber Network ecosystem ever since.Katalyst Is ComingContents1 Katalyst Is Coming2 More on KyberDAO3 Toward the NovelAs Kyber Network continues to gain traction with users, stakeholders are all eyes on Katalyst, a coming upgrade that’s set to seriously reconfigure the economics around the liquidity protocol.First announced last December, Katalyst was introduced to optimize Kyber’s ecosystem and to “encourage participation for key stakeholders,” namely liquidity providers and KNC token holders.For liquidity providers, Katalyst will enact “reserve incentives,” which will pay out transaction fees proportional to how much volume providers facilitate. Moreover, Katalyst will enact a staking system for KNC, Kyber’s native asset, that will allow stakers to also reap a share of Kyber Network’s transaction fees.Another major wrinkle that’s coming along with Katalyst is the launch of KyberDAO, which will allow Kyber Network’s users to decide among themselves how to steer the protocol’s fees going forward. As for participation, KNC tokens will serve as the DAO’s governance token, much like how MKR tokens are used to govern the MakerDAO DeFi lending project.More on KyberDAOIn April 2020, the Kyber Network team published an update on the project’s DAO effort, therein noting that the DAO will start out being steered by Kyber’s specialists while still giving way to the community over time:“We believe that this progressive decentralization achieves the main goals of broad representation, transparency, resilience, and network stability — and we would love to work with the community to continuously improve both the on-chain and off-chain processes as we continue to evolve.”In another update posted in May, the Kyber Network team explained it was preparing to cater to so-called “pool operators,” which could represent factions of KNC voters:“KNC holders who are willing to stake their tokens but do not have the resources to regularly participate in voting in every epoch (about 2 weeks), have the ability to delegate their voting power to another Ethereum address or a ‘pool’ to vote on their behalf. Projects or developers that set up and manage this voting pool are called ‘pool operators’.”Toward the NovelKyber Network’s been gunning to set itself ahead of other DEXes in recent times.For example, Kyber’s associated KyberSwap DEX rolled out a fiat-to-crypto gateway last fall. Just a few weeks prior to that, the decentralized liquidity protocol rolled out non-custodial limit orders for traders who want to remain in control of their funds at all times.As such, Kyber’s clearly trying to set the tone when it comes to UX in the DeFi arena.    2,078"
78,Blockonomi,Bitcoin Miners Are Leaving the Network En-Masse After “Brutal” Halving,Nick Chong,1589469095.0,"On the day of Bitcoin’s block reward halving earlier this week, digital asset manager and analyst Charles Edwards speculated that it would be the “most brutal halving in history,” noting how miners with skinny profit margins would be forced to capitulate out of the market after their revenues halve.Many were quick to cast aside these fears, branding it as “FUD” or an old and broken narrative. However, true to the ever-contrary nature of the cryptocurrency market, Edwards’ bearish view was accurate with reports from blockchain analytics companies registering a strong crash in Bitcoin’s hash rate.But that’s not necessarily a bad thing.Bitcoin Hash Rate Plunges 30%Contents1 Bitcoin Hash Rate Plunges 30%2 Crash of Hash Rate Isn’t Necessarily Bearish3 Halving Still Helps Bitcoin’s Bull CaseOn May 11th, Bitcoin experienced its third block reward halving when block 630,000 was mined into existence.In the hours after the halving, it appeared that miners were stable, and were not subject to the “brutality” of a 50% decline in revenues that Edwards alluded to. Data from cryptocurrency mining site CoinWarz indicated that eight hours after the halving, Bitcoin’s hash rate was actually sitting at its seven-day moving average.But this is changed as a few days have passed since the halving. According to May 14th data shared by blockchain analytics company Coin Metrics, the halving has started to have “large impacts” on the Bitcoin network.The hash rate — the measure of computational power being used to mine blocks, or process transactions in layman’s terms —  has “dropped 30%.” This has caused the Bitcoin network to slow down by approximately 25%, with blocks mining slower, increasing transaction fees as the demand for transactions has not matched the slowing in processing.Less than 48 hours after halving, we've already seen large impacts on #BitcoinInefficient miners appear to be leaving the network as hash rate has dropped 30%. It will likely recover after a period of churn where efficient miners replace less efficient operations. pic.twitter.com/X7Vk7Hz0zb— CoinMetrics.io (@coinmetrics) May 14, 2020While the hash rate is subject to spikes and declines as miners try and maximize profits, there may be no immediate spike higher this time around.The decline in hash rate is in line with an analysis by Matt D’Souza, a hedge fund manager and the chief executive officer of Blockware Mining.D’Souza said on the date of the halving that if Bitcoin trades around the $8,000s and $9,000s levels, more than 30% of miners are actually unprofitable. This increases the chances of “extreme capitulation,” whereas miners are forced to turn off their machines and potentially sell their coins.Crash of Hash Rate Isn’t Necessarily BearishWhile the word “capitulation” strikes fear into the hearts of Bitcoin investors around the world — the term was used ad nauseam during the crash in 2018 — it’s not necessarily a bad thing.As prominent finance podcaster and Bitcoin bull Preston Pysh explained in response to D’Souza’s analysis:“During the 2016 halving, the price went sideways for 9 days and then had a 28% drop, and it took 100 days to get back to the halving price. Mentally prepare yourself for the efficiency cleansing and difficulty adjustment as the protocol prepares all passengers for launch.”Also, data compiled by Edwards suggests that after every Bitcoin miner capitulation, a strong surge in the market has taken place. Edwards’ table below depicts this, as it shows that every time capitulation was signaled by the Hash Ribbons indicator, what followed was a massive macro surge to highs. Halving Still Helps Bitcoin’s Bull CaseAlthough the halving may be crushing the profitability of many miners, analysts are still certain that the event will help Bitcoin’s bull case in the longer term.In a comment made on a Bitcoin halving-themed livestream hosted by Tone Vays — a former vice president at J.P. Morgan — Gemini founders Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss said that the halving prepares Bitcoin for its next round of exponential growth:We’re set for another order of magnitude step up — whether $20,000 is the Bitcoin base, maybe we see $100,000. But each [halving], the cryptocurrency becomes exponentially bigger than we could imagine.    2,365"
79,Blockonomi,"Bitcoin Surges to $9,700 Despite Federal Reserve’s Economic Fears",Nick Chong,1589467766.0,"Bitcoin has continued to trend higher on Thursday after passing $9,000 on Wednesday, recently spiking as high as $9,950 to only return to $9,700 as of the time of this article’s writing. From the lows seen early this week, BTC is up 20%. Chart of Bitcoin’s price action from May 7 to today from TradingView.comBitcoin’s rally comes in spite of the fact that the S&P 500 and bonds are continuing to slip lower. They are responding to the Federal Reserve’s chairman Jerome Powell, who issued a statement Wednesday indicating that the United States’ economic outlook remains poor in spite of many states attempting to restart their economies.Even with this poor economic outlook, analysts are still bullish on the medium-term outlook for the cryptocurrency market.S&P 500 Slips as Federal Reserve Is Still CautiousIn his latest statement, Jerome Powell doubled down on his fears that the U.S. is currently going through its greatest modern recession ever, explaining that America could experience an economic hit “without modern precedent.”According to The New York Times, the economist added that even with the Federal Reserve’s stimulus efforts and the Treasury’s attempts to issue money to people and companies, “there is a sense a growing sense I think, that the recovery will come more slowly than we would like.”The expectations of a “V-shaped recovery” have turned into expectations of a U, then an L, or maybe no solid recovery at all. As Powell continued, without proper support from governments, there will be “long-term economic damage” as mass unemployment and the bankruptcies of thousands of businesses turn the business cycle negative.Powell’s statement has already had an impact on markets, with the S&P 500 slipping 2% lower during Wednesday’s trading session and losing another 0.5% on Thursday’s trading session thus far. But as aforementioned, Bitcoin has been rallying in the face of this recession.Sell Stocks and Buy BitcoinAlthough the narrative that has developed over the past few months is that Bitcoin will trade perfectly in tandem with the S&P 500 in recession conditions, it is clear that the cryptocurrency is starting to deviate from the stock market. Case in point: year to date, BTC is up over 20% while the S&P 500 is down over 10%.This trend of stocks underperforming while Bitcoin rallies is a trend that multiple prominent investors expect to continue.Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, Chamath Palihapitiya, one of the earliest Facebook executives and the chief executive of Social Capital, asserted that stocks are too high compared to where the economy truly is.Palihapitiya argued that the Federal Reserve is divorcing the economy from financial markets because of the stimulus, which props up even companies that are regarded as “junk” by the market.Although he made no promises stocks will return lower once the economic reality sets into the minds of investors, he made a big deal about how Bitcoin could benefit in this macroeconomic environment.As reported by Blockonomi, responding to a question about billionaire macro investor Paul Tudor Jones diving head-first into Bitcoin, Palihapitiya said: Even he is looking at Bitcoin. The reason is because […] you need to figure out how to protect yourself. However you think about it — from a classic economic theory or the “shmuck insurance” or you’re skeptical of the established governing masses — it is important that we have a hedge. And I still struggle to find anything that is as uncorrelated to anything else and to everything else than Bitcoin.The investment thesis of “sell stocks and buy Bitcoin” was echoed by Raoul Pal, chief executive of Real Vision and a former executive at Goldman Sachs, who asserted in multiple interviews that Bitcoin is one of the only assets he is holding aside from cash at the moment.Pal pointed to two things: 1) how the chart of the Dow Jones looks much like it did prior to the latter half of the Great Depression, which crushed stocks; and 2) the U.S. dollar is on the verge of “breaking,” which will force investors to seek safe havens like Bitcoin.    2,035"
